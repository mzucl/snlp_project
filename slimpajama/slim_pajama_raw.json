He is a Professor of Electrical Power Engineering at Imperial College London, and Co-Director of the Energy Futures Lab with a role of fostering interdisciplinary energy research across the university. His research uses the flexibility of power electronics to enable electricity networks to operate with very high fractions of low carbon technologies. In HVDC, he has contributed converter designs that strike improved trade-offs between power losses, physical size and fault handling. In distribution systems, he has pioneered the use of soft open points. He has made important contribution to the study of stability of grid-connected inverters. Prof. Green is a Chartered Engineering in the UK, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of IEEE.\nWebinar Abstract: The replacement of electro-mechanical machines by inverter-based resources (IBR) is fundamentally changing the dynamics and stability properties of grids. A review will be made of the needs a grid system has in order that it is stable and secure. The needs in terms of voltage strength, frequency regulation and synchronisation will be discussed in term of how they are met by synchronous machines, grid-following converters and grid-forming converters. A case will be made that there is advantage in not all resources being obliged to provide all system services and that new services can replace some traditional services. Thus, strictly following a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) approach may not yield the best solution.\nApproaches to ensuring system-wide dynamic stability will also be explored noting that IBR have overlapping sets of dynamics but with details often hidden in black-box models. A method for identifying root-causes of poorly damped modes in black-box models will be illustrated. This analytical grey-box method avoids exhaustive transient simulation. A toolbox for compiling models of composite grids with IBR and synchronous machines will be introduced. The talk will conclude with some thoughts on modelling and analysis challenges that remain for IBR dominated grids.\nAbout G-PST Consortium\nThe chief executive officers of National Grid Electricity System Operator UK, California Independent System Operator (CAISO), Australia Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Ireland's System Operator (EirGrid), and Denmark's System Operator (Energinet) are champions in developing the consortium mission and activities.

According to the agreement, on-site inspectors from both countries would be permitted to observe the destruction process.\nThe treaty, which called for an 80-percent reduction of their chemical weapon arsenals, was part of an effort to create a climate of change that would discourage smaller nations from stockpiling and using the lethal weapons. First developed during World War I, most countries in the world were in possession of the technology needed to build chemical weapons by 1990, and some such as Iraq, had readily engaged in chemical warfare in recent years.\n1990 Dow Jones Avg hits a record high of 2900.97\n1988 Finaliza en Mosc\ufffd la cumbre Reagan-Gorbachov con la ratificaci\ufffdn del acuerdo entre Estados Unidos y la URSS para la eliminaci\ufffdn de misiles de alcance intermedio.\n1986 As announced earlier in the year, AT&T shuts down its Net 1000.

The action was viewed by many in the West as a direct challenge to President Jimmy Carter's new foreign policy emphasis on human rights and his criticism of Soviet repression. Shcharansky, a 29-year-old computer expert, had been a leading figure in the so-called \"Helsinki group\" in the Soviet Union. This group came into existence in 1975, after the signing of the European Security Act. The European Security Act, also referred to as the Helsinki Accords, was the result of US and Soviet efforts to reinvigorate the spirit of d\ufffdtente. The two nations called 35 other countries together to discuss a variety of topics, and the final agreements signed at the meeting included guidelines for human rights.\nAlthough the Soviets signed the act, Jewish dissidents in Russia complained that their rights continued to be violated, particularly their right to emigrate. These Jewish dissidents and other human rights activists in the Soviet Union came together to form the Helsinki group, which was designed to monitor Russian respect of the 1975 act. Shcharansky was one of the best known of this group, particularly because of his flair for sparking public interest in human rights violations in Russia. President Carter used the situation of Russian Jews as an example of the human rights violations he wished to curtail when he came into office in 1977. The Soviets responded with a series of arrests of Helsinki group leaders and the deportation of others.\nShcharansky, the most vociferous of the group, came in for the harshest treatment. In June 1977, he was charged with treason, specifically with accepting funds from the CIA in order to create dissension in the Soviet Union. After a perfunctory trial, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was finally released in February 1986, when he and four other prisoners were exchanged for four Soviet spies who had been held in the West. Shcharansky's arrest and imprisonment elicited a good deal of criticism from the American people and government, but the criticism seemed merely to harden the Soviet position. It was not until after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, promising a freer political atmosphere in the Soviet Union, that Shchransky and other political dissidents, such as Andrei Sakharov, were freed from prison and internal exile. Despite the relatively freer atmosphere of the Gorbachev years, members of the Helsinki group, as well as other Soviet dissidents, continued to press for greater democratic freedom and human rights right up to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n1973 Se proclama la Rep\ufffdblica en Grecia, presidida provisionalmente por el general Georgios Papadopoulos.\n^ 1971 Vietnam Veterans group announces support for Nixon\nIn support of the Nixon Administration's conduct of the war, a group named the Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace declares that it represents the majority of the US veterans that had served in Southeast Asia, and calls the protests and congressional testimony of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War \"irresponsible.\" On 19 April, as a prelude to a massive antiwar protest, the Vietnam Veterans Against the War began a five-day demonstration in Washington DC. The generally peaceful protest, called Dewey Canyon III in honor of the February and March operation in Laos, ended on 23 April with some 1000 veterans throwing their combat ribbons, helmets, and uniforms along with toy weapons on the Capitol steps. Earlier they had lobbied with their congressmen, laid wreaths in Arlington National Cemetery, and staged mock \"search and destroy\" missions.\n^ 1964 Top US officials meet on Vietnam\nTop US officials concerned about the Vietnam War gather for two days of meetings in Honolulu. Attendees included Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Gen. William Westmoreland, Gen. Maxwell Taylor, and CIA Director John McCone, among others. Much of the discussion focused on the projected air war against North Vietnam, including a list of 94 potential targets. There was also a discussion of the plan for a joint Congressional resolution. The meeting was convened to develop options for President Lyndon B. Johnson in dealing with the rapidly deteriorating situation in Vietnam. In March 1964, Secretary of Defense McNamara had reported that 40 percent of the countryside was under Viet Cong control or influence. Johnson was afraid that he would be run out of office if South Vietnam fell to the communists, but he did not want to employ US military power on a large scale because of the impact that such actions might have on his Great Society domestic programs.\nUpon returning from the meeting in Honolulu, several of Johnson's advisers, led by William Bundy, developed a scenario of graduated overt pressures against North Vietnam, according to which the president, after"}
{"text":" securing a Congressional resolution, would authorize air strikes against selected North Vietnamese targets. Johnson rejected the idea of submitting the resolution to Congress because it would \"raise a whole series of disagreeable questions\" which might jeopardize passage of the administration's civil rights legislation. However, the idea of such a resolution would surface again in less than two months. In August 1964, after North Vietnamese torpedo boats were (probably falsely) reported to have attacked US destroyers, in what became known as the Tonkin Gulf incident, McNamara and Rusk appeared before a joint Congressional committee on foreign affairs. They presented the Johnson administration's arguments for a resolution authorizing the president \"to take all necessary measures\" to defend Southeast Asia. Subsequently, Congress passed Public Law 88-408, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, giving President Johnson the power to take whatever actions he deemed necessary, including \"the use of armed force.\" The resolution passed 82 to 2 in the Senate, where Wayne K. Morse (D-Oregon) and Ernest Gruening (D-Alaska) were the only dissenting votes; the bill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives. President Johnson signed it into law on 10 August. It became the legal basis for every presidential action taken by the Johnson administration during its conduct of the war.\n1963 El ministro de Defensa brit\ufffdnico, John Dennis Profumo, renuncia a su cargo a causa del esc\ufffdndalo de sus relaciones con la \"call-girl\" Christine Keeler.\n1959 Constitution of Tunisia promulgated (National Day)\n^ 1958 De Gaulle reassumes French leadership\nDuring a French political crisis over the military and civilian revolt in Algeria, Charles de Gaulle was called out of retirement to head a new emergency government. Considered the only leader of sufficient strength and stature to deal with the perilous situation, the former war hero was made the virtual dictator of France with power to rule by decree for six months.\nA veteran of World War I, de Gaulle had unsuccessfully petitioned his country to modernize its armed forces in the years before the outbreak of World War II. After Philippe Petain and other French leaders signed an armistice with Nazi Germany in June of 1940, he fled to London, where he organized the Free French forces and rallied French colonies to the Allied cause. His forces fought successfully in North Africa, and in June of 1944, he was named head of the French government in exile. On 26 August, following the Allied invasion of France, de Gaulle entered Paris in triumph, and in November, was unanimously elected provisional president of France. However, he resigned two months later, claiming he lacked sufficient governing power.\nHe formed a new political party that had only moderate electoral success, and in 1953, he retired. However, five years later, in May of 1958, the Algerian revolt created a political crisis in France, and he was called out of retirement to lead the nation. A new constitution was passed, and in late December, he was elected president of the Fifth Republic.\nOver the next decade, President de Gaulle granted independence to Algeria and attempted to restore France to its former international stature by withdrawing from the US-dominated NATO alliance and promoting the development of French atomic weapons. However, student demonstrations and workers\ufffd strikes in 1968 eroded his popular support, and in 1969, his proposals for further constitutional reform were defeated in a national vote. On 28 April 28 1969, Charles de Gaulle, seventy-nine years old, retired for good. He died the following year.\n1952 Se suprimen las cartillas de racionamiento en Espa\ufffda.\n^ 1952 Linus's security blanket appears for the first time in Peanuts [shown below]\nLinus Van Pelt inspired the term \"security blanket\" with his classic pose.

{"text":". This \"gas van\" would become the death chamber for a total of 360'000 Jews from more than 200 communities in Poland. The advantage of this form of extermination was that it was silent and invisible. One month before the infamous Wannsee Conference of January 1942, during which Nazi officials decided to address formally the \"Jewish question,\" the gas vans in Chelmno were used to kill up to 1000 Jews a day. The vans provided the \"Final Solution\" for Adolf Eichmann and other Wannsee attendees. The mass gassings were the most orderly and systematic means of eliminating European Jewry.\nEventually, more such vans were employed in other parts of Poland. There was no thought of selecting out the \"fit\" from the \"unfit\" for slave labor, as in Auschwitz. There was only one goal: utter extermination. On 01 June 1942, the story of a young Jew, Emanuel Ringelblum, (who escaped from the Chelmno death camp after being forced to bury bodies as they were thrown out of the gas vans), was published in the underground Polish Socialist newspaper Liberty Brigade. The West now knew the \"bloodcurdling news \ufffd about the slaughter of Jews,\" and it had a name-Chelmno.\n1941 Nazi Germany bans all Catholic publications\n1941 II Guerra Mundial: los ingleses entran en Bagdad.\n^ 1941 Crete falls to German forces\nDuring World War II, Crete, the last Allied stronghold in Greece, is captured by German forces at high cost to both sides.\nIn late 1940, the Greek army, reinforced by the British air force, decisively repulsed an Italian invasion of their country. However, in April of 1941, Allied triumphs in Greece turned to defeat when Nazi leader Adolf Hitler turned his undefeated German Wehrmacht against the country. The German army advanced so quickly that the British chose to cancel plans to send reinforcements to Greece.\nOn 23 April, the Greek king and his government evacuated to Crete, an island south of the Greek mainland, and the next day, a general Allied evacuation to the island began. For the next six days, the Germans assaulted the Allied ships en route to Crete, killing some 15'000 Allied sailors and troops. However, by 29 April, almost 50'000 British, Greek, Australian, and New Zealand troops had reached the safety of the heavily fortified island.\nThree weeks later, the German invasion of Crete began, with over 20'000 German parachute troops landing on the island within a few days. Under heavy resistance from the Allies, the Germans succeeded in gaining control of an airfield, and were thus able to fly in a steady number of reinforcements. On 26 May, the Allies began to move to the southern coast of Crete, where an evacuation to British-controlled Egypt began. By 01 June the last of some 20'000 surviving Allied troops had escaped, and Crete fell to the Axis.\n1940 L'\ufffdvacuation de Dunkerque, commenc\u00e9e le 28 mai, continue; el sera termin\ufffde le 3 juin -- Chute de Lille\n1936 Mussolini proclaims King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, 66, Emperor of Ethiopia, which is made part of Italian East Africa shortly after having been annexed on 09 May 1936.\n1924 La f\ufffdbrica Ford de Detroit pone en el mercado el autom\ufffdvil n\ufffdmero 10 millones.\n^ 1917 Cadillac founder resigns\nHenry Leland, the founder of the Cadillac Motor Car Company, resigns as company president. Ever since William Durant had arranged for General Motors to purchase Cadillac, Leland and Durant had endured a strained relationship, but Leland\ufffds electric starter had made Cadillac so successful early on that Durant had avoided meddling with the autonomy of his company.\nLeland\ufffds next great achievement at Cadillac was his supervision of his son\ufffds proposal that Cadillac should introduce a V-8 engine. Previously, Cadillac, and most other American companies, had only offered four-cylinder engines. The in-line six- and eight-cylinder engines experimented with by other companies had proven troublesome and required constant maintenance. Henry\ufffds son, Wilfred Leland, suggested that Cadillac oppose two four-cylinder engines in a V-shaped formation. The idea was not unheard of, as the French automaker DeDion-Bouton had already used such a configuration. But Cadillac aimed to create a more powerful, higher quality V-8 engine. In order to keep the project secret Leland contracted the parts for his new engine to over half a dozen New England firms in such a way that the companies had no idea what the parts were for. They were then delivered to a dummy manufacturing firm called Ideal Manufacturing Company. The new Cadillac car with its V-8 was put on the market in 1914. It was received with a good deal of skepticism, as some people thought that such a complicated engine would create problems"}
{"text":" for drivers. Nonetheless, the engine proved a great success and was standard in Cadillacs until 1927.\nThe success was followed, however, by the outbreak of war in Europe. Leland had visited the continent a few years earlier as a part of a contingent of engineers. He had returned to America convinced that war in Europe was inevitable and that it would decide the fate of Western Civilization. He was adamant that the United States would become involved sooner or later, and at the outbreak of the war he urged Durant to let Cadillac convert its facilities to the manufacture of aircraft engines, specifically the Liberty engine. The two stubborn men butted heads. Durant refused to respond to Leland\ufffds urgings, and Leland resigned. Durant\ufffds assistant Charles Mott suggested that Leland had not resigned but was fired for other reasons.\nWhatever the circumstances, Leland left and started the Lincoln Motor Car Company. In 1917 he won the first contract to manufacture Liberty engines for the war effort. Leland worked closely with British, French, and American engineers to design a high-production, high-powered twelve-cylinder airplane engine for the war effort. By the war\ufffds end, Lincoln had manufactured more Liberty engines than any other single company. GM marques Cadillac and Buick also manufactured Liberty engines.\n1915 first Zeppelin air raid over England\n1907 -33\u00ba C, Sarmiento, Argentina (South American record)\n^ 1890 Counting machines used in census\nSome 45'000 census counters set out to count the US's sixty million plus population. The census takers took along hole punches and recorded the results of their surveys by punching out designated spots on the card, like a train conductor punching a ticket. Later, those cards were counted by a tabulating machine invented by 29-year-old Herman Hollerith. In a test run, Hollerith's counting machine had proven dramatically faster than other proposed counting methods. Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896. Through a series of mergers and reorganizations, the company eventually became IBM.\n1880 The first pay telephone service begins, in New Haven, Connecticut.

James Lawrence, said, \"Don't give up the ship\" during a losing battle with a British frigate.

The nation's maritime interests had been caught in the crossfire of the Napoleonic Wars since the early 1800s. Though France had long since begged off from interfering with US economic activities, England persisted in its practice of halting US ships and seizing men who were suspected of having deserted the Royal Navy. Reluctant to build up America's military forces, Madison attempted to rebuff the British through fiscally minded measures. However, neither the Embargo Act (1807) nor successive versions of non-intercourse legislation (1809, 1810) did much to dissuade the British from their habit of harassing American ports and ships. And so on this day in 1812, Madison gave the call to Congress"}

Just three days later the hawkish House voted 79 to 49 to engage England in armed conflict; by the end of the month the United States was embroiled in the War of 1812.\n^ 1809 Coleridge begins to publish The Friend\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, who helped establish the Romantic school of poetry, begins to publish his own periodical, The Friend. The essays that Coleridge published in The Friend are later collected into a book, Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, and Miscellaneous Essays From \"The Friend\".\nColeridge led a turbulent, tragic life. Born on 21 October 1772 in the small town of Ottery St. Mary in Devonshire, England, he was sent to school in London after his father's death. He was a lonely student who fell into dissolution and debt after he went to Cambridge in 1791. He fled his creditors and enlisted in the cavalry, which he later abandoned with help from his brothers. He returned to Cambridge, where he met poet Robert Southey. The two launched an ambitious plan to establish a democratic utopia in Pennsylvania. To further the plan, Coleridge married a woman he did not love, the sister of Southey's fianc\ufffde. When Southey abandoned the plan, Coleridge remained in the ultimately unhappy marriage.\nIn 1795, Coleridge met the poet William Wordsworth. The two became close friends and collaborators, assisted by Dorothy Wordsworth, the poet's sister. The Wordsworths moved near Coleridge in 1797, and the following year Wordsworth and Coleridge published Lyrical Ballads, which established the Romantic school of poetry. It included Coleridge's famous poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\nColeridge's life began unraveling at the turn of the century. He became estranged from his wife and fell in love with Sara Hutchinson, whose sister married Wordsworth three years later. Meanwhile, his health began to suffer, and he began taking large doses of opium to control his rheumatism and other problems. He became addicted to opium, and his creative output waned. In 1810, he broke with Wordsworth, and the two would not reconcile for nearly 20 years.\nStarting in 1808, he supported himself for a decade with successful lecture series on literature. Meanwhile, he single-handedly wrote, edited, and distributed The Friend for about a year, and in 1813 his tragedy Remorse was well-received. Thanks to the help of Dr. James Gillman and his wife (with whom Coleridge eventually lived), the poet began to cut back on his opium use. In 1816, he published the fragmentary poem \"Kubla Khan,\" written under the influence of opium around 1797. In 1817, he published a significant work of criticism, Biographa Literaria, and in 1828 was reconciled with Wordsworth. Coleridge died on 25 July 1834.\nCOLERIDGE ONLINE:\nKubla Khan\nConfessions of an Inquiring Spirit, and Miscellaneous Essays From \"The Friend\"\nSelections and commentary by John Spencer Hill:\nA Coleridge Companion\nImagination in Coleridge\nCo-authored with Wordsworth:\nLyrical Ballads\nLyrical Ballads Translations of Euripides:\nAndromache\nThe Cyclops\nThe Herecleidae\nHippolytus\nThe Phoenissae\nThe Suppliants\n1809 Allardyce Barclay begins a bet of walking 1 mile every hour for 1000 hours.

After a relatively clean record in the early days of the American Revolution, Arnold was charged with malfeasance, misusing government wagons, illegally buying and selling goods, and favoritism to the British Loyalists. Although his notorious betrayal was still many months away, Arnold's resentment over this order and the perceived mistreatment by the American Army would fuel his traitorous decision. Abruptly interrupted at its outset by a British attack north of New York City, the court-martial did not get under way again until 23 December in Morristown, New Jersey. Although Arnold was cleared of most charges, General George Washington issued a reprimand against him, and Arnold became increasingly angered.\nWhile on a trip to the important West"}
{"text":" Point base to ensure that it could withstand a British attack, Arnold stewed over his slight by Washington and the Americans. He thought that he had never been properly rewarded or acknowledged for his military success on their behalf. He began corresponding with British spies about the possibility of changing sides. Arnold negotiated his defection to the British and the subversion of West Point over the next several months. The British already held control of New York City and believed that by taking West Point they could effectively cut off the Americans' New England forces from the rest of the fledgling nation.\nIn August 1780, Sir Henry Clinton offered Arnold \ufffd20'000 for delivering West Point and 3000 soldiers. Arnold told General Washington that West Point was adequately prepared for an attack, even though he was busy making sure that it really wasn't. He even tried to set up General Washington's capture as a bonus. His plan might have been successful, but his message was delivered too late and Washington escaped. The West Point surrender was also foiled when an American colonel ignored Arnold's order not to fire on an approaching British ship.\nArnold's defection was revealed to the Americans when British officer John Andr\ufffd, acting as a messenger, was robbed by AWOL Americans working as pirates in the woods north of New York City. The notes revealing Arnold's traitorous agreement were stashed in his boots. Arnold and his wife Peggy, who fooled American officers into believing she had no involvement in the betrayal, escaped to New York City. At the British surrender at Yorktown, Benedict Arnold was burned in effigy, and his name has since become synonymous with traitor. The British didn't treat him very well after the war either. After prevailing in a libel action, he was awarded only a nominal amount because his reputation was already so tarnished. He died in 1801 and was buried in England without military honor.\n1774 British government orders Port of Boston closed.\n1533 Ana Bolena es coronada reina de Inglaterra.\n1252 Alfonso X el Sabio es proclamado rey de Castilla y Le\ufffdn.\n1183 El rey de Castilla Alfonso VIII firma el Tratado de Fresno-Lavandera con Fernando II de Le\ufffdn, por el que este \ufffdltimo se compromet\ufffda a romper su alianza con los almohades y atacar sus plazas.\n< 31 May 02 Jun >\n^ Deaths which occurred on a 01 June:\n2006 Luis Albarran, 5, and his uncle Magno Albarran, 29, and mother Flora Albarran, 22, and their mother Emma Valdez, 46, and Emma's husband Alberto Covarrubias Sr., 56; and their sons Alberto Covarrubias Jr., 11, and David Covarrubias, 9; shot by criminal on parole Desmond Turner, 28, and James Stewart, 30, intent on robbing the Covarrubias home in the 500 block of North Hamilton Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana, at 22:00 (03:00 UT on 02 June) as Flora Albarran (who, on that day, had moved from that home to an apartment) arrives to pick up her son.

He managed to maintain Nepal's independence despite encroaching influences by India, China, and the Soviet Union. During his reign Nepal was opened up to extensive tourism.\nBeginning early in 1990, a popular prodemocracy movement led to demonstrations that erupted into seven weeks of demonstrations and bloody clashes with the soldiers and police. On 06 April 1990 police fired at 200'000 demonstrators marching toward the royal palace. At least 72 persons died, according to officials, but more than 300 according to witnesses. Submitting to pressure, Birendra lifted the ban on political activity and on 09 November 1990, approved a new constitution that preserved his status as chief of state but provided for a multiparty parliamentary democracy, a separation of powers, and the protection of human rights. The king has since remained a figurehead much like the queen of England, appearing in ceremonies and addressing the Parliament once a year.\nBirendra was crowned king on 24 February 1975. He was the latest monarch in the Shah dynasty, which has held the throne since the mid-1700s. Many Nepalis, especially illiterate farmers who comprise the bulk of this country's population of nearly 22 million, viewed the king as the reincarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. Some 90% of Nepal's population is Hindu. Hundreds of people lined the streets of Katmandu on 29 December 2000 to greet King Birendra on his 55th birthday.\nThe shootings come at a time of major political instability in Nepal. Opposition parties have been demanding Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's resignation for the government's alleged role in a bribery scandal and for not better quelling a Maoist insurgency. The country was shut down for three days earlier in the week by the opposition parties to press for the resignation. Parliament was stalled the entire winter session earlier in the year and street protests have been held regularly. http:\/\/www.nepalnews.com\/\nDipendra was declared heir-apparent in January 1972 and in 1990 he was given the added title Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Nepal Army. Two years later he was appointed chairman of the Council of Royal Representatives responsible for looking after affairs of state during the king's absence. Born on 27 June 1971, he was the eldest son of King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya [07 Nov 1949 \u2013 01 Jun 2001]. Educated at schools in Kathmandu, he later followed in his father's footsteps by attending Eton College in England. At university in the Nepali capital Dipendra gained a first class BA"}
{"text":" degree and an MA in geography. Following his studies he trained at the Royal Nepal Military Academy, and, like his father, gained a licence to fly a helicopter. He had been patron of the Nepal Sports Council since 1992 and had travelled widely in both Asia and Europe. In his first ever interview in 1993, given to The Rising Nepal and Gorkhapatra newspapers, he said: \"As long as everybody works according to the constitution and stays within the laws of the land, I don't think there will be any problem.\" His hobbies were flying helicopters, swimming, squash, listening to Nepali folk songs and modern and classical western music, playing the electronic piano and guitar at the royal palace and reading poetry\n[< 1990 photo. From left to right are King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya, Prince Nirajan, Princess Sruti Dipendra, and heir to the throne Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev]\nA soft-spoken man with glasses and a moustache, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was 10th in his line to rule Nepal and considered an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. King Birendra had won popularity with his people when he bowed to mass protests led by centrist and leftist parties and promulgated a new constitution in 1990. The new constitution turned the world's only Hindu king into a British-style monarch and handed over power to a multi-party parliament. Though his new role gave him more time for his hobbies such as painting and riding, King Birendra continued to wield considerable influence in the Himalayan kingdom. Weaker Nepali governments depended on him for support and he retained under the new constitution the right to name a prime minister in the event of a hung parliament. Born in Kathmandu on 28 December 1945, he was the first of Nepal's monarchs to get a formal education. After eight years at a Jesuit school in Darjeeling, India, he attended England's prestigious Eton College between 1959 and 1964. Later he studied briefly at the University of Tokyo and spent a year at Harvard where he studied political theory. Two years after returning from the United States, he married Queen Aishwarya Rajya Laxmi Devi Shah in 1970. Crown Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was born in June 1971. Birendra ascended the throne in 1972 at the age of 26, but as a teenager his father conferred on him the title of Grand Master and Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Nepalese Army. He was a keen conservationist and was the patron of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation.\n2001 20 Israelis and a Palestinian suicide bomber in Tel Aviv, at about 23:00 outside the Dolphinarium disco, on the beachside walkway Herbert Samuel Esplanade, near its southern end, when a suicide bomber from Islamic Jihad, mingling with those waiting to get in, detonates the explosives strapped around his waist.

He moved to Qalqilyah with his brother about two years ago, leaving the rest of his family in Jordan. According to the PA sources, Hutari was arrested and held for 12 days by Palestinian security forces two months ago following a suicide bomb attack in March that killed two Israeli youths and wounded four. That attack, in Neveh Yamin, was carried out by a friend of Hutari's, Fadi Atallah. Hezbollah television station, Al-Manar, reported last night that the military wing of Hamas, Az a Din al Kassam, had taken responsibility for Friday's suicide bombing. In an interview with Abu Dhabi television yesterday, Hutari's father Hassan said he did not regret his son's action, adding that Sa'id's bravery would be remembered by Palestinians. \"If I had 20 children, I would send them to commit suicide in Israel and kill Israelis,\" he said. Israeli security sources said they had numerous reports about preparations for more terror attacks by Hamas.\n. Abu Dhabi television identified the attacker as Said Hassan Hotari from the West Bank town of Qalqilya. Relatives there said the family moved to Jordan, but Hotari, in his early 20s, lived with an uncle in Qalqilya for the last two years, and was a close friend of a suicide bomber who blew himself up on March 28, killing two Israeli children.\n2001 Xolani Nkosi Johnson, 12, of AIDS in his sleep at 05:40, in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Blind and deaf from infancy, Keller circumvented her disabilities to become a world-renowned writer and lecturer. Helen Adams Keller was born on June 27, 1880, on a farm near Tuscumbia, Alabama. A normal infant, she was stricken with an illness at 19 months, probably scarlet fever, which left her blind and deaf. For the next four years, she lived at home, a mute and unruly child. Special education for the blind and deaf was just beginning at the time, and it was not until after Helen's sixth birthday that her parents had her examined by an eye physician interested in the blind. He referred the Kellers to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone and a pioneer in teaching speech to the deaf. Bell examined Helen and arranged to have a teacher sent for her from the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston. The teacher, 20-year-old Anne Sullivan, was partially blind. At Perkins, she had been instructed how to teach a blind and deaf student to communicate using a hand alphabet signaled by touch into the student's palm.\nSullivan arrived in Tuscumbia in March 1887 and immediately set about teaching this form of sign language to Helen. Although she had no knowledge of written language and only the haziest recollection of spoken language, Helen learned her first word within days: \"water.\" Keller later described the experience: \"I knew then that 'w-a-t-e-r' meant"}
{"text":" the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free.\"\nUnder Sullivan's dedicated guidance, Keller learned at a staggering rate. By April, her vocabulary was growing by more than a dozen words a day, and in May she began to read and arrange sentences using raised words on cardboard. By the end of the month, she was reading complete stories. One year later, the seven-year-old Keller made her first visit to the Perkins Institution, where she learned to read Braille. She spent several winters there and in 1890 was taught to speak by Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. Keller learned to imitate the position of Fuller's lips and tongue in speech, and how to lip-read by placing her fingers on the lips and throat of the speaker. In speaking, she usually required an interpreter, such as Sullivan, who was familiar with her sounds and could translate. When she was 14, Keller entered the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf in New York City. Two years later, with Sullivan at her side and spelling into her hand, she enrolled at the Cambridge School for Young Ladies in Massachusetts.\nIn 1900, she was accepted into Radcliffe, a prestigious women's college in Cambridge with classes taught by Harvard University faculty. She was a determined and brilliant student, and while still at Radcliffe her first autobiography, The Story of My Life, was published serially in The Ladies Home Journal and then as a book. In 1904, she graduated cum laude from Radcliffe. Keller became an accomplished writer, publishing, among other books, The World I Live In (1908), Out of the Dark (1913), My Religion (1927), Helen Keller's Journal (1938), and Teacher (1955).\nIn 1913, she began lecturing, with the aid of an interpreter, primarily on behalf of the American Foundation for the Blind. Her lecture tours took her several times around the world, and she did much to remove the stigmas and ignorance surrounding sight and hearing disorders, which historically had often resulted in the committal of the blind and deaf to asylums. Helen Keller was also outspoken in other areas and supported socialism all her life. For her work on behalf of the blind and the deaf, she was widely honored and in 1964 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. \"My life has been happy because I have had wonderful friends and plenty of interesting work to do,\" Helen Keller once wrote, adding, \"I seldom think about my limitations, and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times, but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers. The wind passes, and the flowers are content.\"\nIn infancy, scarlet fever had left her blind, deaf, and (consequently) mute. Her parents appealed to Alexander Graham Bell for help and he referred them to a semi-blind teacher, Anne Sullivan, who taught Helen to speak with an alphabet communicated by touch. Helen Keller graduated cum laude from Radcliffe and gained international recognition as a writer and teacher.\nAnn Sullivan was born on 14 April 1866 in Feeding Hills, Mass. of Irish immigrant parents. Her mother Alice Cloesy was a caring woman who died of tuberculosis when Annie was eight. Of the three children Annie was left at home with her shiftless and ill-tempered father, while the other two were taken by relatives. Throughout her youth, Annie's eyes continued to weaken from trachoma she had contracted early in life.\nOf her arrival on 03 March 1887 at Helen Keller's home, she later wrote:\n\"...It was 6:30 when I reached Tuscumbia. I found Mrs. Keller and Mr. James Keller waiting for me.... My first question was, \"Where is Helen?\"... I had scarcely put my foot on the steps, when she rushed toward me with such force that she would have thrown me backward if Captain Keller had not been behind me. She felt my face and dress and my bag, which she took out of my hand and tried to open. It did not open easily, and she felt carefully to see if there was a keyhole. Finding that there was, she turned to me, making the sign of turning a key and pointing to the bag....\"\nHelen (born on 27 June 1880) was deaf and blind since the age of 19 months. Early on Annie realized that to work with Helen she would need to be the main conduct for information and discipline, so she and Helen moved into a cottage in the Keller property. Ann Sullivan taught Helen to make signs with her hand to spell words. It was some time until Helen understood those signs as concepts, the first one being \"water\".\nIn a letter on 05 April 1887, Ann Sullivan wrote: \"... something very important has happened. Helen has taken the second great step in"}
{"text":" her education. She has learned that everything has a name, and that the manual alphabet is the key to everything she wants to know.... This morning, while she was washing, she wanted to know the name for \"water.\" When she wants to know the name of anything, she points to it and pats my hand. I spelled \"w-a-t-e-r\" and thought no more about it until after breakfast. Then... we went out to the pump-house, and I made Helen hold her mug under the spout while I pumped. As the cold water gushed forth, filling the mug, I spelled \"w-a-t-e-r\" in Helen's free hand. The word coming so close upon the sensation of cold water rushing over her hand seemed to startle her. She dropped the mug and stood as one transfixed. A new light came into her face. She spelled \"water\" several times. Then she dropped on the ground and asked for its name and pointed to the pump..., and suddenly turning round she asked for my name. I spelled \"Teacher.\" Just then the nurse brought Helen's little sister into the pump-house, and Helen spelled \"baby\" and pointed to the nurse. All the way back to the house she was highly excited, and learned the name of every object she touched, so that in a few hours she had added thirty new words to her vocabulary.\" [on 1 April Helen knew 29 words in all]\nHelen Keller wrote about that day:\n\"We walked down the path to the well-house.... Some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten\u2014a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that \"w-a-t-e-r\" meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!... I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought.\"\nAs Helen progressed Annie's eyes continued to worsen. Helen began to write in 1902, and published her The Story of My Life. (Keller online)\nIn 1927 Neela Braddy met Annie to write her biography. Annie told Neels the story of Terksbury and of her childhood, something she had kept from Helen for a long time. This biography Anne Sullivan was published in 1933.\nAnn Sullivan died on 20 October 1936 in Forest Hill NY.\nIn June 1960, a fountain was dedicated at Radcliffe College in memory of Ann Sullivan. At the dedication Helen Keller said one word \"Water\".\n[photo: Helen Keller and Ann Sullivan, 1895 >]\nSome relevant links: Ann Sullivan reads a book to Helen Keller \u2014 Life of Helen Keller \u2014 Life of Ann Sullivan \u2014 Helen Keller's Home Page \u2014 Books by Helen Keller about education \u2014 Time Line of Helen Keller \u2014 A Starter Course on Helen Keller\n1947 David Enskog, Swedish mathematician born on 22 April 1884.\n^ 1946 Ion Antonescu, former Romanian dictator, executed for war crimes\nThe pro-Nazi dictator of Romania during World War II is executed in Bucharest for his crimes against humanity.\nAfter World War I, Antonescu [15 Jun 1882\u2013] served as military attach\ufffd in Paris and in London and, in 1934, as chief of the Romanian general staff.

It is unfortunate that something like this has to happen for this to become 'newsworthy'.\nThis follows 10 days of peaceful actions in London.

Please read.\nYou may have already heard: Extinction Rebellion activists took to the Tube and blocked Shadwell and Canning Town this morning in an effort to cause mass disruption and raise public awareness about the climate and ecological emergency.\nFirstly, we would like to sincerely apologise for the delay it took to formulate a proper response to this action.\nXR press and PR channels are still formulating an official statement that will deal with this incident in its entirety but for the sake of being transparent, we feel that we should address this issue now.\nWe recognise that this action unnecessarily targets ordinary commuters and disrupts London transport - which is an eco-friendly way to travel.\nThough the affinity group (AG) organising this received feedback that majority of rebels within our movement felt as if this action sent the wrong message, our decentralised structure means that AGs are able to act autonomously and make tactical decisions to carry out actions independently.\nHaving said that, our structure of decentralisation is no excuse for how poorly we, as environmentalists acting on behalf of life, acting this morning.\nWe did not have open dialogues about the nature of this action.\nShadwell and Canning Town are areas of London with largely working class and highly ethnic populations.\nWe acknowledge that these are communities who stand to be most affected by the climate crisis and are most vulnerable to systems of power.\nIn light of this morning's Tube action, Extinction Rebellion London will take this opportunity to reflect with humility how we can improve in the future...\n...Extinction Rebellion's core principles include non-violence, and we aim to create safe and accessible spaces.\nThe systematic change we are fighting for does not include interrupting and threatening people's livelihoods.\nUnfortunately, the nature of the organisation means that actions can go ahead without the full support of everybody within XR.\nThe violence seen at the stations today was heartbreaking to see, and is not something we want to be tied to [us] as an organisation.\nOur principles also include the value we place on reflecting and learning, and we would like to take this time to say that this what we will focus on following this morning.\nToday's action was a learning experience for Extinction Rebellion as an organisation.\nAlthough we are pushing for disruption and civil disobedience, we are still learning how to do this in a way that does not result in violence, and that does not discriminate against hard-working individuals.\nTube protester: 'We were targeting the city because blocking roads has not got us heard'\nRuth Jarman, 56, from Christian Climate Action, who was involved in the tube action this morning but was not arrested, said: \"Ok - why we disrupted the DLR. We were targeting the city - one of the economic powerhouses of the world to cause economic disruption - because that is what those in power pay attention to.\n\"We have spent a lot of time blocking roads and are not being heard.

This type of action is completely at odds with what Extinction Rebellion are campaigning for and we will continue to urge them to not target any rail network.\n\"However, it was also concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behaviour to detain a protester at Canning Town.\n\"Understandably, the delay to passengers' journeys would have been annoying, but this level of response was unacceptable.

Each time he was released after a short time so simply returned to the protest, the spokesman said.\nMark Ovland\nOvland was one of the 12 semi-naked protestors who invaded Parliament in April, gluing themselves to the glass above bemused MPs.\nIn a recent blogpost, he wrote: \"Sometimes I'm going to get that wrong, and sometimes the actions I choose to take part in won't be popular, I know that. But I'm really not in this to be popular.\n\"I'm in this because I love life so so much, and I want it to continue and I don't know what else to do. I'm wanting to help raise an alarm so loud that no one can ignore it.\"\nExtinction Rebellion said he was the man who was holding a fire hose when the climate change group calamitously tried to spray the Treasury building with fake blood on October 3.\nUnfortunately for Mr Ovland, he lost his grip of the high-powered equipment and the hose flew out of control, wildly spraying passersby on the street.\nExtinction Rebellion to 'take stock' over continued disruption\nThe protest group's organisers will \"take stock\" over whether to continue with future disruption to the transport network after this morning's ill-advised\nXR spokesman Howard Rees, 39, said: \"Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure. I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say.\n\"I think we need to take stock of it.\"\nMr Rees, a PR worker from London, said the intention was not to \"inconvenience hard-working people\", and said he did not think the apparently unsympathetic mood on the platform was indicative of a decrease in public support despite many posts on the XR London Facebook page expressing concerns that the stunt was counterproductive and should not have gone ahead.\nHe said: \"It is not our intention to target individuals or inconvenience hard-working people. We're in a life or death situation right now.\n\"The only thing the Government is interested in is money, so that's why the transport system was targeted.\n\"If you're causing disruption but people are impacted, it is nothing compared with the disruption that is coming down the line, let me tell you.\n\"It (the footage) was really horrifying, I'm deeply distressed by it. I'm concerned for everybody who was caught up in it.\n\"I really hope he (the protester) is all right. My understanding is he is in custody. I don't think it (the footage) is reflective (of the public support).\n\"The passive support at the beginning of last week is not what we need.\n\"What we need is active support, people who are willing to get arrested, and that doesn't have to come from a majority.\"\nThe impact of humans on Earth is unparalleled, with scientists arguing our actions have tipped the planet into a new era - the Anthropocene - with fallout from nuclear bombs now written into the rocks beneath our feet, and species facing extinction at 1,000 times"}

{"text":"Six-Month Update on Progress in Advancing the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)\nAt the UNFCCC COP26 in November 2021, the governments of South Africa, with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union \u2013 together forming the International Partners Group (IPG) \u2013 announced a new ambitious, long-term Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to support the Republic of South Africa's (RSA) decarbonization effort in the context of domestic climate policy, including transitioning its economy towards cleaner energy sources. A distinguishing feature of the JETP is its emphasis on the centrality of a just transition in the structuring of the investment plan and financing package.\nThe JETP is a pathbreaking initiative and the first of its kind. It is long-term and ambitious in its aspiration to support South Africa's pathway to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society; to accelerate the just transition and the decarbonization of the electricity system (including rehabilitation and repurposing of mines); and to support the development of new economic opportunities such as green hydrogen and electric vehicles amongst other interventions to support RSA's shift towards a greener future.\nIn line with the political declaration issued in November 2021, the IPG undertook to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years to advance the Partnership. It was determined that the Partners would within six months provide a leader level progress update.\nGiven South Africa's commitment to decarbonise its energy intensive economy as set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and the commitment of the IPG to support developing countries in achieving this in ways that are inclusive and equitable, the Partnership has the potential to provide a model that could be replicated across the globe. In particular it has the potential to practically demonstrate how a just transition could be achieved and financed and to serve as a catalyst for a new inclusive development path in which every effort is made to leave no-one behind.\nIn addition, given South Africa's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, as tragically demonstrated by the recent devastating floods and loss of life and property in KwaZulu-Natal, the urgency of investments in climate-resilient infrastructure is clear.\nAs such, the JETP opens the way for long-term, ambitious and systemic climate actions to be funded through a range of instruments that support flexible and rapid implementation in ways that build confidence in a just energy transition. Key to realising the finance and the implementation of the JETP will be the finalisation of a fully approved and actionable Investment Plan (JETP-IP), with the intention of achieving this by November 2022 and COP27. The investment plan will identify the projects and activities required to achieve a just transition, and guide the use of funds.\nKey priorities of the Partnership include:\nAccelerating decarbonisation of South Africa's electricity sector, including expanding renewable energy sources and strengthening the transmission network to accommodate new investments in renewables;\nProtecting vulnerable workers and communities affected by the move away from fossil fuels;\nSupporting the reform process underway and future reforms essential to strengthen the enabling environment for the just transition;\nAddressing environmental aspects of the transition, including mine rehabilitation;\nSupporting the repurposing of mine sites (e.g. for renewable energy and agriculture);\nSupporting opportunities for technological innovation and both public and private investment to drive the creation of green and quality jobs including in the Green Hydrogen and Electric Vehicles sectors; and In the design of the Partnership, ensuring that the programme gives due consideration to South Africa's fiscal challenges.\nBuilding an enabling environment\nThe JETP benefits from, and will be enabled by, policy reforms that have been implemented in South Africa since COP 26 and which affirm the relevance and focus of the JETP. These include, but are not limited to:\nAn updated Climate Change Bill was tabled in Parliament in early 2022. The legislation would create a regulatory framework that enables the development of an effective climate change response and a long-term, just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient society.\nSimilarly draft legislation has been published that proposes significant changes in the regulation of the electricity sector, including to establish an independent transmission operator to enable a competitive electricity market, alongside the restructuring of Eskom.\nThe Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) has just concluded a wide consultation process on a Just Transition Framework released on 23 February 2022 which will be finalised and presented to Cabinet. This is supported by the release of a Just Energy Transition discussion document by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) that gives further substance to South Africa's approach to a just transition.\nA sixth round of bids for renewables under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) is underway, consistent with the country's Integrated Resource Plan.\nNotably, the raising of the licensing threshold for new generation capacity from"}

The first two 100MW projects had their registration approved in May 2022 and will soon commence construction.\nPositive developments related to green hydrogen are in place, including the development of a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap led by the Department of Science and Innovation. The Industrial Development Corporation, working with KfW, is identifying early-stage project potential, and in the Northern Cape work is underway to develop a port at Boegoebaai that is critical to the development of an export market for green hydrogen.\nSouth Africa launched a South African Green finance taxonomy in April 2022 that outlines assets, projects, and sectors that are eligible to be defined as \"green\" in line with international best practice and national priorities. It is a voluntary market tool, with regulatory guidance expected later in 2022 followed by the development of a regulatory instrument from 2023.\nA Sustainability and Climate Change Disclosure Guidance, based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), was launched by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 14 June 2022.\nThe National Treasury has also indicated that the carbon tax rate will progressively increase every year to reach US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2026. In the second phase after 2025, the medium-term to long-term path will include more rapid and aggressive annual increases thereafter, to at least US$30 by 2030, accelerating to higher levels by 2035, 2040 and up to US$120 beyond 2050.\nThe DMRE is working to finalise a National Mine Closure Strategy, which will bring policy clarity and provide operational guidance for mine closures.\nA South African Renewable Energy Master Plan is being developed that will outline a roadmap to support the expansion of renewable energy sources and supply chains in the country.\nIn addition, significant work on the just transition has been undertaken outside of government that the Partnership can draw from, including:\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions' (COSATU) Just Transition Blueprint, which reflects the active engagement of organised labour in developing policy responses for affected workers;\nThe Life After Coal Campaign's Just Transition Open Agenda, which is one of several inputs that civil society have made on the just transition;\nThe sustainability and climate disclosure guidance as well as guidance related to sustainable bonds and transition securities listings issued by Johannesburg Stock Exchange; and\nWork undertaken by organised business such as the National Business Initiative and Business Unity SA, as well as academic and policy research institutions such as Mistra, the CSIR and TIPS, on the trajectory that South Africa could take to meet the lower end of the NDC target range and move towards a net zero pathway.\nTaken cumulatively, these developments have placed the just energy transition, in all its elements, at the centre of the national policy agenda and action by stakeholders across society. Likewise, the JETP is being debated widely across South African society and is seen as a potential catalyst to enable key interventions in support of more rapid decarbonisation. Specifically, its potential to support the resolution of South Africa's electricity supply shortfall, contribute to economic recovery and avenues for sustaining and improving the quality of livelihoods affected by the transition through alternative employment opportunities is well recognised, as is the potential for the Programme to leverage significant new private sector investment.\nFollowing the announcement of the Partnership at COP26, the IPG was set up to coordinate amongst its members and with the government of the Republic of South Africa. It is currently chaired by the United Kingdom and co-ordination takes place between respective capitals as well as amongst their Missions in South Africa. The IPG has worked to ensure a common approach to the Partnership from IPG members, engaged with the DFIs and MDBs that are the key entities involved in the delivery of the JETP and had multiple engagements with the South African government.\nIn February, President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Mr Daniel Mminele, a former Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank and Group CEO of Absa, to lead a Presidential Climate Finance Task Team (PCFTT) that is the counterpart for the IPG within South Africa. Mr Mminele has moved swiftly to appoint PCFTT members representing key government departments and state-owned entities, as well as leading experts. The PCFTT reports to an Inter-Ministerial Committee that is chaired by President Ramaphosa. Its mandate is to engage with the IPG with a view to advising Cabinet on the composition, affordability, and alignment of the financing package with the South African regulatory environment; coordinate relevant government departments, development finance institutions, and the private sector; and oversee the development of relevant financing mechanisms and facilities to enable the flow of international climate finance to support South Africa's just transition in"}

Frequent discussions between the IPG Chair and Mr Mminele, as well as with the IPG more broadly, are underway and are building both consensus and clarity on the scope and nature of the Partnership.\nSupport structures: JETP Secretariat\nThe Partnership's work is supported by a JETP Secretariat that provides a technical and coordination function to the Partnership, in a neutral and objective manner. The Climate Investment Fund Board has been approached by the IPG and generously agreed to resource and support the work of the Secretariat. All JETP partners have agreed to the appointment of Ms Joanne Yawitch, outgoing Chief Executive Officer of the National Business Initiative in South Africa, as Head of the Secretariat.\nThe Secretariat conducted a set of engagements in South Africa in early May 2022 to inform its work in supporting the JETP in terms of its scope, structure, and timelines.\nThese consultations included the PCFTT, the IPG, relevant government focal points and development finance institutions and formally initiated the process to support the development of the JETP-IP. Key issues discussed included:\nConsultations on the nature of the financial offer, including its sources, composition, concessionality, conditionalities and how it could be structured for maximum impact, as well as the ways in which it could be leveraged to bring in additional finance;\nDeveloping a shared understanding of ambition in relevant priority areas and in relation to South Africa's NDC range and the investment activities related to this in each of the identified priority areas;\nConsultations on the JETP IP outline and contents, including how the just transition elements should be centrally embedded as a fundamental element of the programme, as well as critical next steps and timelines for its finalisation; and\nThe scope, roles and responsibility of the JETP Secretariat, including finalising its Terms of Reference.\nThe above areas for consideration are based on analytical work that includes:\nAssessment of relevant policies, guidelines and analytical work and the on-going work in the Just Transition area.\nA preliminary review of the investment and policy implications of achieving the most ambitious target possible within South Africa's updated NDC range through 2030 and beyond, including a preliminary costing and related financing needs of achieving the lower end of the range.\nMapping the development financiers' activities and programmes that support the Just Energy Transition, and which are under implementation, preparation, and planned. This includes the following 15 entities: European Commission (EC), IBRD, KfW, GIZ, DEG, AfDB, IFC, AFD, FCDO, BII, EIB, DFC as well as DBSA, IDC and NDB. The analysis addresses both qualitative and quantitative terms, disaggregated by instrument type (grants, concessional loans as defined by the OECD DAC methodology, and non-concessional loans\/guarantee). This will provide an insight into the landscape of activities and associated financing by development banks, which will further complement the JET-IP process.\nThe JETP Secretariat consultations took place at the same time as the second mission of the Accelerating Coal Transition Investment Programme (ACT-IP) funded by the CIF and led by the WBG and the AfDB were in South Africa. The ACT-IP and its programming will be aligned with and supportive of the broader JETP and that it is be developed as an integral element of the broader programme.\nWorking Group establishment\nThe JETP will establish five working groups that will be the vehicle through which key technical expertise and experience can be mobilised to inform the development of the JETP-IP. The PCFTT and the IPG have decided to establish a cross-cutting Finance Working Group, an Implementation Working Group, and three working groups addressing the power sector, green hydrogen and the transport sector. Just transition and environmental considerations will be incorporated into each working group.\nThe terms of reference for the working groups are being developed and will focus on the sequencing of investments relative to the NDC, their contribution to a just transition, and South Africa's ambitions, priorities, and environmental challenges.\nWork is underway by the JETP Secretariat to identify the expertise required for the working groups, including representatives from governments, bilateral and multilateral institutions, and the private sector.\nFinancing package\nDiscussions are underway between the PCFTT and the IPG regarding the nature of funding to be provided through the partnership.

They are cognisant of the need to consider all forms of finance, including grants, concessional and non-concessional and public and private finance, as well as to ensure that the total package of financing is appropriately structured to support South Africa's climate ambitions.\nIn addition, there is considerable interest in the JETP from other potential financiers and donors.\nJETP linked initiatives in progress\nImportantly, and central to the JETP, South Africa is conducting a countrywide consultation process on the just transition as a core element of its climate response. The JETP will build on existing work relevant to the Partnership, including the financing and architecture that would allow for the just transition to be realised in ways that open up opportunities for affected workers and communities.\nThe JETP recognizes that there are a number of bilateral and multilateral initiatives at different degrees of readiness that will seek to support South Africa in meeting its short and long-term goals. The Eskom Just Energy Transition Project at Komati is under development and will likely be presented to the World Bank Board for approval before COP27. This project addresses the repowering and repurposing of the Komati Power Station and has a substantial social and just transition component. In addition, project preparation for the Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) Investment Programme run under the auspices of the CIF is underway. The proposed support involves an indicative allocation of $200-500 million linked to country needs and ambition. This Programme, supported by the IBRD, IFC and the African Development Bank, is to be submitted for approval by October 2022. In addition, work is in progress regarding transmission network strengthening and the private sector pipeline of renewables projects all create the basis for the JETP Investment Plan within an environment that is aligned to and supportive of its aims.\nThere is also ongoing work related to both green hydrogen and electric vehicles, including a partnership between KfW and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation to support potential green hydrogen-related investments and UK support for the development of the Hydrogen Roadmap. In addition, a policy-based operation is already under preparation by AFD and KfW to support South Africa's priorities.\nFocus for the next six months\nThe Political Declaration determined the JETP's foundation, its principles and basis for engagement. The declaration emphasizes the long-term nature of the Partnership and ensuring that the financing package supports and meets country needs and catalyses the necessary action.\nThe Principals are strongly focused on mobilising investment in the short term, within the context of a longer-term plan, and are using the JETP-IP to compile an emerging portfolio in the priority sectors set out in the Political Declaration.\nWhile momentum has built up in relation to the JETP, there is much work to be done both to refine the financing package and to develop the JETP-IP. These two objectives will be the focus of the forthcoming period, with significant work already underway.\nWork plan with milestones leading up to COP27\nThe indicative work plan to December 2022 contains the following priority deliverables and targets:\nEstablishment of Working Groups by June 2022\nDraft JETP-IP by July 2022\nSecond draft JETP-IP by September 2022\nFinal JETP-IP by October 2022\nIPG and PCFTT sign-off by early November 2022\nPRESIDENTIAL CLIMATE FINANCE TASK TEAM AND THE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS GROUP"}

The dryer was built by locally available, biologically degradable, low-cost materials. The dryer consists of solar flat plate air heater with three layers of insulation, drying chamber and a fan with a regulator to induce required air flow in the system. Banana is the chosen crop for the experimentation since it is high in production and also has substantial loss in India. Also, dried bananas are having good nutritive value which makes it as essential diet.\nThe experiments were conducted to dry banana slices and to study its drying characteristics like rate of drying and quality of dried banana in terms of taste, colour and shape. The dryer has the following features: two different air flow configurations (air flow between glass cover and absorber plate called as the top flow and air flow between absorber plate and the bottom insulation of solar collector called as the bottom flow), forced flow with variable flow rates from 0\u20133 m\/s and two different mounting schemes (conventional trays and wooden skewers).\nIn the top and bottom flow experiments, the bottom flow provided about 2.5 \u00b0C higher chamber temperatures than the top flow for the same solar energy input. The efficiency of top flow configuration was found to be 27.5 %, whereas the efficiency of bottom flow configuration was found to be higher at 38.21 %. The results also agree well with the theoretical calculations performed as 60 W of energy can be saved for the same energy input.\nThe drying rate was found to increase when wooden skewers were used instead of conventional trays. At the end of the day, the total difference in moisture content is found to be 3.1 % which is considerable knowing that the rate of drying drastically decreases with time. Banana dried at 1 m\/s air flow rate was of the best quality in terms of colour, taste and shape when compared to drying at 0.5 and 2 m\/s air flow rate while the weather condition and ambient conditions were almost the same for all the cases with negligible difference.\nSolar drying\nDesign of solar dryer\nTop flow and bottom flow\nConventional trays and wooden skewers\nVarying air flow rate\nIn many parts of the world, awareness is growing about renewable energy which has an important role to play in extending technology to the farmer in developing countries like India to increase their productivity. Poor infrastructure for storage, processing and marketing in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region results to a high proportion of waste, which average between 10 and 40 % [1]. Although India is a major producer of horticultural crops, many Indians are unable to obtain their daily requirement of fruits and vegetables and the Human Development Index (HDI) is very low. Considerable quantities of fruits and vegetables produced in India go to waste owing to improper postharvest operations and the lack of processing [1]. This results in a considerable gap between gross food production and net availability [1]. Reduction of postharvest losses is essential in increasing food availability from existing production [2]. Traditional techniques used in food preservation are drying, refrigeration, freezing, salting (curing), sugaring, smoking, pickling, canning and bottling. Among these, drying is especially suited for developing countries with poorly established low-temperature and thermal processing facilities. It offers a highly effective and practical means of preservation to reduce postharvest losses and offset the shortages in supply.\nDrying is a method of dehydration of food products which means reducing the moisture content from the food to improve its shelf life by preventing bacterial growth [3]. It is still used in domestic up to small commercial size drying of crops, agricultural products and foodstuff such as fruits, vegetables, aromatic herbs, wood etc. contributing thus significantly to the economy of small agricultural communities and farms [4\u20136].\nHii et al. [7] have shown that sun drying (laying the crops under direct sunlight) is economical, but the product obtained by it is of lower quality due to contamination by dust, insects, birds, pets and rain. Also, loss of vitamins, nutrients and unacceptable colour changes due to direct exposure to ultraviolet rays, and it takes long time to dry. Solar dryers are specialized devices that control the drying process and protect agricultural products from damage by insect pests, dust and rain. Umog"}
{"text":"bai et al. [8] made a comparison between sun drying and solar drying and obtained that solar dryers generate higher temperatures, lower relative humidity, lower product moisture content and reduced spoilage during the drying process than sun drying. Rajeshwari and Ramalingam [9] have demonstrated that the drying time in case of solar dryers compared to open air drying reduced by about 20 % and produces better quality dried products. Solar dryers are available in a range of size and design such as tunnel dryers, hybrid dryers, horizontal- and vertical-type dryers, multi-pass dryers and active and passive dryers [10\u201317]. Hii et al. [7] classified solar dryer according to their heating modes and the manner in which the solar heat is utilized, namely forced air circulation or active solar dryers and natural air circulation or passive solar dryers. Three distinct sub-classes of either the active or passive solar drying system can be identified depending upon the design or working principle of the dryer, mode of drying and type of product to be dried, namely integral or direct mode, distributed or indirect mode and mixed mode solar dryers. It should be noted that sunlight may affect certain essential components in the product, e.g. chlorophyll is quickly decomposed. If available places are scarce, indirect mode types of dryers are preferred for drying larger quantities. In such case of indirect mode, nutritive value of the food product and colour is retained.\nMohanraj and Chandrasekar [18] and Banout and Ehl [19] concluded that forced convection solar dryer is more efficient than natural convection dryers. Also, products can be dried faster in the case of forced convection solar dryer than in the case of natural convection solar dryer, and end products obtained from forced convection drying have a superior quality.\nFrom the literature survey, it is evident that though there are many dryer designs which involve the flow of air between glass cover and absorber plate in the collector [20] and also in some other designs, the flow is maintained between absorber plate and bottom insulation [21]. However, there is no comparison of the performance done between these two cases in a single setup. Hence, there is a requirement for comparative study to address the relative performance of the above-mentioned cases and hence to arrive at a better and efficient flow configuration.\nIndian Horticulture Database 2013 [22] shows that banana is the most important fruit crop in India, accounting for 32.6 % of the total fruit production. Almost the entire production is used fresh, and hence, the entire production is subjected to the postharvest losses of 17.87 %. Banana is the chosen crop for the experimentation since it is high in production and also has substantial loss in India. Also, dried bananas are having good nutritive value which makes it as essential diet [23\u201325].\nMost of the thin-layer drying of fruits is carried on using stainless steel meshed trays [26]. In practice, trays have many disadvantages which include sticking of the dried products to the trays, difficulty in loading and unloading, hygiene among others. Hence, an innovative way of placing the bananas in the trays is devised in which wooden skewers are used to hold the fruits. Though the various literatures on drying banana included the studies on the optimum slice thickness, solar-assisted dryer for bananas and effect of various pre-treatments and temperatures on banana among others [26\u201329], the effect of the air velocities on the moisture removal rate and quality of the dried bananas obtained has not been studied. As air velocity also plays an important role in drying of food products [30\u201333], there is a need to address the effect of air velocity on drying of banana.\nIn the present study, low-cost indirect-type solar dryer was designed and constructed using locally available environmentally friendly materials to compare the performance of the flat plate collector for the top flow and the bottom flow of air both theoretically and experimentally, to compare the performance in the form of moisture removal rate and dryer efficiency for different banana mounting methods such as wooden skewers and on conventional trays and to dry banana using different air velocities 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s and to compare the quality of the end product in terms of taste, texture, colour and final moisture content.\nThe design process of the dryer first involved the collection of the climatic data of the study location, i.e. Bengaluru. Further, the other important data such as insolation was studied and calculated as per the collector configuration. For the initial phase of dryer design, many existing designs were studied and some of the design parameters were determined. The performance of the dryer was then analysed [34\u201337]. Once the dimensions of the dryer were fixed, an appropriate axial fan was selected to obtain the required flow rates.\nClimatic data collection\nBengaluru"}

Solar radiation over the year on horizontal surface in Bengaluru is found to be 666.635 W\/m2 [38]. Total solar radiation on a 13\u00b0 tilted surface is calculated as 676.367 W\/m2.\nThe dryer was constructed using plywood, stainless steel mesh, wooden skewers, clear glass, galvanized iron sheet and axial fan for operation of the dryer which are locally available with low cost.\nThe thickness of banana slices was selected to be 4\u20135 mm [17, 27, 29]. An indirect type of solar dryer was considered as it does not affect the colour and nutrient content of the produce as in the case with a direct type. Also, the drying is uniform without any localized heating. Flat plate collector is used since it is easy to fabricate and also economical. The collector is made up of GI sheet of 0.6 mm thick as it is a good conductor and economical. It was painted black to increase the absorption of heat [39, 40]. The recommended glass thickness for collector is 5 mm [37]. Air gap of 5 cm is recommended for a tropical climate [37]. The insulating material was selected to be plywood as it is a good insulator as well as environmentally friendly. It also does not have any carcinogenic effects which other popular insulating materials like glass wool have. To reduce the heat loss, a layer of air sand witched between two plywood sheets (Figs. 1 and 2). To further reduce the heat loss by radiation and to avoid moisture absorption by wood, aluminium foil is wrapped on the inside of the chamber [41]. Food grade stainless steel mesh for the trays and food grade wooden skewers were selected for placing of banana. To ensure the constant flow rate of air during the experimentation, an axial flow fan was selected based on the calculations of pressure drop in the system and the required flow rate limit of air at 3 m\/s. For the purpose of experimentation, 1.5 kg of banana of Poovan variety which is locally available is used.\nTop flow\nBottom flow\nIn the design, a flat plate collector with an area of 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u20090.6 m2 is considered. The performance of the collector is described by an energy balance that indicates the conversion of solar radiation into useful energy gain and losses. The thermal analysis was done to calculate the heat gain and losses for flow of air between glass cover and absorber plate which is the top flow and flow of air between absorber plate and bottom insulation which is the bottom flow [3, 36, 41]. Figures 1 and 2 show the typical configuration of top flow and bottom flow, respectively.\nTable 1 consolidates the results from the thermal analysis. It is seen that heat loss from the top, side and bottom of the collector is more for top flow configuration compared to bottom flow configuration. This is due to the reduced temperature difference between the collector and the ambient.\nTop loss (W)\nSide loss (W)\nBottom loss (W)\nTotal (W)\nSpecification of the dryer\nTable 2 gives the specification of the dryer.\nAbsorber plate dimension\n1.6\u2009\u00d7\u20090.6 m\nGlass cover thickness\nInsulation total thickness (bottom)\nGap between absorber plate and glass cover\nGap between absorber plate and insulation\nNumber of trays\nTray dimension\nDistance between trays\nTilt angle of the collector\n13\u00b0 due south\nThe solar dryer was placed over the roof top of a building based on the design (Fig. 3). Axial flow fan was fixed at the top of the drying chamber and tested. The experiments were conducted in the month of March, from daily 9 am to 5 pm. The solar radiation was measured using pyranometer. The K-type thermocouples were used for the measurement of temperature in the collector assembly. The temperature was measured for each hour from 9 am to 5 pm at three points, namely entry, middle and exit of the glass cover, absorber plate and bottom insulation as it can be seen in Fig. 4. The temperature of the air in the drying chamber and the atmosphere were measured by the thermometer. A vane-type anemometer is used to measure the air velocity. The weight of the banana is measured using a digital weighing pan. All the experiments were repeated to confirm the repeatability of the data obtained. The following experiments are carried out:\nSolar dryer setup\nFlow over the absorber plate (top flow) and flow beneath the absorber plate (bottom flow)\nCase A: Air is allowed to pass between the absorber plate and glass cover (Fig. 4). The air passage between absorber plate and bottom insulation is blocked using a cardboard with adhesive tape and glue.\nCase B: Air is allowed"}
{"text":" between the absorber plate and the bottom insulation (Fig. 5). The air passage between glass cover and absorber plate is blocked using a cardboard with adhesive tape and glue.\nThe temperature readings were taken, and the losses and gain are calculated and compared.\nIn this case, the banana was placed on conventional trays (Fig. 6) and wooden skewers (Fig. 7) and allowed to dry for 8 h from 9 am to 5 pm. The air flow velocity is maintained as 1 m\/s in the collector. The moisture content removed from the banana slices was compared.\nBanana kept on trays\nWooden skewers\nTo calculate the final moisture content, the following formula is used:\n$$ \\mathrm{Percentage}\\kern0.5em \\mathrm{moisture}\\kern0.5em \\mathrm{content}=\\frac{77.2\\times {w}_i-100\\times {w}_l}{w_i-{w}_l} $$\nwhere 77.2 % is the initial moisture content of banana variety selected.\nEfficiency for the dryer system is given by [41].\n$$ \\eta =\\frac{{\\mathrm{mL}}_w}{\\mathrm{AIt}} $$\nThe air flow though the dryer was varied using a speed regulator for the axial flow fan. The experiments are conducted, and repeatability tests are also made. As the experiments have been done on consecutive days, there is a very little change in atmospheric temperature and solar radiation.\nBased on the test results of drying banana slices kept in trays and wooden skewers, varying velocity tests were conducted only on banana slices attached to skewers. The velocity of air flow is maintained as 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s in the collector region (0.0169, 0.0338 and 0.0676 m3\/s volume flow rate) for a duration of 16 h of drying time for consecutive days with each day 8 h from 9 am to 5 pm. Every hour the weight of the banana slices was measured, and the moisture content and the efficiency of the dryer were calculated. At the end of the day, banana slices were stored in air-tight bags. After drying for 16 h, the dried banana samples obtained from using 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s were compared in terms of taste, texture, colour and final moisture content.\nThe average solar insolation in Bengaluru in the month of March as measured with a pyranometer is shown in Fig. 8. It can be noticed that the insolation increases by the day from 9 am to 1 pm and then starts to drop. The maximum radiation received was 1033 W\/m2 at 1 pm, whereas it was 293 W\/m2 at 5 pm.\nSolar insolation over the day\nComparison of the top flow and bottom flow\nFigure 9 shows the temperatures of the ambient air and chamber temperatures over the entire day from 9 am to 4 pm. The experiments were conducted on consecutive days and observed that the ambient temperatures were quite similar. Hence, the average ambient temperatures of 2 days were used to plot the comparison. In Fig. 9, for the case of the bottom flow, it can be seen that when the air inlet velocity is maintained at 1 m\/s, the maximum temperature of the air outlet is 45 \u00b0C at an ambient temperature of 34 \u00b0C which is 11 \u00b0C above the ambient temperature. In case of the top flow experiment conducted at the same air inlet velocity, the maximum air outlet temperature reached is 42.5 \u00b0C at an ambient temperature of 34.5 \u00b0C which is about 8 \u00b0C above the ambient temperature. It can also be seen from the figure that the air temperature rise and fall closely follow the insolation curve except at the end of the day for the case of the bottom flow. This is due to the heat storage effect of the insulation which helps to maintain the air temperatures in the evening even though the insolation drastically drops. So it is evident that the configuration with the air flow below the absorber plate gives higher air outlet temperature, i.e. about 2.5 \u00b0C more than the one with the air flow above the absorber plate for same solar energy input at the peak insolation. A maximum difference of 3.5 \u00b0C was obtained at 11 am and 4 pm between these two configurations. Another point to be noted is that though the solar insolation drops quite drastically in the post noon period, i.e. from 12 pm, the ambient air temperature does not drop that drastically as it retains the heat being a good insulator. Also, it absorbs the heat radiated by the earth.\nComparison of air outlet temperature for top and bottom flow over the day\nThe collector efficiency indicates the utilized heat against the heat input in the form of solar insolation. Figure 10 compares the efficiency for the two configurations. Lower efficiency"}
{"text":" at 9 am is due to the fact that the experiment was started at 9 am and the setup had not yet stabilized. The increase in efficiency during the evening in the case of the bottom flow may be attributed to the heat storage by the insulation. When insolation drops, the stored heat is retrieved, thus maintaining higher air temperature and hence higher efficiency. The efficiency of the system was least at the peak insolation hour of 12 pm. This is because the plate temperature rises rapidly in the noon with higher insolation, but the heat removal capacity of the air does not meet this additional load due to its fixed velocity. Thus, the air does not take away the heat which stays in the collector chamber and is hence lost to the surroundings in the form of various losses leading to lower efficiencies of the system. If the air velocity is increased in order to improve the efficiency, the air outlet temperature from the collector would decrease. Hence, a balance has to be maintained between collector efficiency and air outlet temperatures. The total loss for the top flow is 201.9 W, whereas it is 139 W for the bottom flow. This saves nearly 62.9 W in total if bottom flow configuration is used. The mean efficiency for top flow configuration is 27.5 %, whereas it is 38.21 % for bottom flow for a day.\nEfficiency for top and bottom flow configuration\nThus, it can be concluded from this experiment that the bottom flow configuration is more efficient than the top flow configuration.\nComparison of conventional trays and wooden skewers\nFigure 11 shows the variation of moisture content with time for the two mounting configurations, i.e. one with conventional trays and the other with wooden skewers.\nMoisture content in trays and skewers over a day\nIt is clear from Fig. 11 that the rate of moisture removal is better with the skewers at every stage of time. At the end of the day, the total difference in moisture content is found to be 3.1 % which is quite considerable knowing that the rate of drying drastically decreases with time. In terms of the weight of moisture removed, it is 825 g for trays while it is 864 g for skewers, the difference being 39 g.\nFigure 12 shows the cumulative dryer efficiency for the above two mounting configurations. The cumulative efficiency is the ratio of the total moisture removed in the form of latent heat to the total energy supplied calculated up to specified time. It can be noted that initially, the difference in efficiencies is higher compared to the later periods, as initially, it is the unbound moisture that is being removed and just depends on the surface area. As the time goes by, the difference between the two curves reduces as the rate of moisture removal becomes much less dependent on the surface area and due to the start of the falling rate phase of drying.\nCumulative dryer efficiency for trays and skewers\nThe cumulative efficiency continuously drops as the rate of moisture removal drops even though the input energy is the same because of this falling rate period. Starting off with better efficiency, the skewer configuration maintains the higher efficiency throughout the day over the tray-type configuration. At the end of the day, the efficiencies are 8.45 and 8.06 % for skewer and tray type, respectively.\nFlow rate for drying of banana\nFigure 13 shows the comparison of moisture content for different flow rates (0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s) over drying time.\nComparison of moisture content for different flow rates over drying time\nThe maximum temperatures achieved with 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s are 49.5, 45 and 41 \u00b0C, respectively, with almost similar ambient air temperature for all the velocities. At the end of 2 days of drying, i.e. 16 h, the moisture content in the bananas is 34.98, 29.63 and 36.04 % for 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s, respectively. If the absolute moisture removal rate is considered then the moisture removal rate is fastest with the velocity of 1 m\/s, followed by 0.5 and 2 m\/s as seen in Fig. 13.\nThe dryer efficiency at the end of 16 h of drying is 5.75, 4.96 and 5.05 % for 0.5, 1 and 2 m\/s, respectively. The reason for slight increase in dryer efficiency for 2 m\/s over 1 m\/s is that the bananas dried at 1 m\/s have reached the falling rate stage of drying for the given time which has impacted the dryer efficiency for the time frame considered. It is seen in Fig. 14 that the drying efficiency is clearly higher with air inlet velocity of 0.5 m\/s, followed by 2 and 1 m\/s. This indicates that higher air temperatures are much more effective in increasing the drying rate with the air velocity playing a minor role. But it is also to be noted that it is just not the drying rate that is important"}
{"text":", the quality of the products obtained is more important. It is noted that with velocity of 0.5 m\/s, the dried banana obtained has cardboard-like structure, hard outer surface, too light and looks like not ripened which is unacceptable. Because of the faster rate of moisture removal with 0.5 m\/s, the rate of evaporation increased which resulted in hardening of the surface. The dried banana samples are shown in Fig. 15. On the other hand, the rapid cooling of the surface of banana slices due to faster air velocity with the air inlet velocity of 2 m\/s resulted in dark colour with blackening of the surface, and the surface became hard. Due which the banana obtained is of unacceptable quality. This also impacted the rate of drying as can be seen in Fig. 13. But the banana samples obtained by drying at a velocity of 1 m\/s at the collector inlet are having more consistent quality of dried banana with good colour, texture, no dusty appearance, chewy and natural aroma. So with 1 m\/s, good quality of banana can be obtained with quite high drying rates. The dried banana samples obtained with different air velocities were also compared with the dried banana samples obtained by Wakjira et al. [29] and Brett et al. [42]. These also confirm that the dried banana samples obtained by a velocity of 1 m\/s are acceptable.\nCumulative efficiency for different flow rates\nDried banana sample. a 0.5 m\/s. b 1 m\/s. c 2 m\/s\nIn the top and bottom flow experiments, the bottom flow provided about 2.5 \u00b0C higher chamber temperatures than the top flow for the same solar energy input. The efficiency of top flow configuration is found to be 27.5 % and the total heat loss or the case is found to be 201.9 W, whereas the efficiency of bottom flow is found to be higher at 38.21 % and the total heat loss is found to be 139 W. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical values with the savings of 62 W energy. Hence, the bottom flow configuration is more efficient. The drying rate is found to be increased when skewers are used instead of conventional trays with ease of loading and unloading of banana in the case of skewers. At the end of 16 h of drying, about 3.1 % difference in moisture content is obtained between the two configurations which is significant. The result also shows that the banana dried at 0.0338 m3\/s volume flow rate (velocity of 1 m\/s over the collector) is of the best quality in terms of colour, taste and shape when compared to drying at 0.5 and 2 m\/s flow rate for the same solar energy input and atmospheric conditions.\nWe are thankful to the Principal, RV College of Engineering, Head of the Department, Mechanical Engineering for their support throughout the work.

{"text":"The m\/other voices foundation rose from the research project (m)other voices: the maternal as an attitude, maternal thinking and the production of time and knowledge led by Deirdre M. Donoghue (artist, writer, researcher), between June 2013 and June 2014. The project's purpose was to initiate discourse and the doing of maternal theory within arts and other fields of cultural production and to reflect on the maternal figure as a thinker and a producer of knowledge. By considering the maternal as an attitude towards our being in the world, and as a practice held together by an ethos of ultimate hospitality towards 'the other', the m\/other voices foundation explores relations between maternal work and -experience, -thinking and -time and the production of knowledge within arts and beyond.

{"text":"Animals without borders: conservation, economics, and spatial subsidies of transboundary migratory species (hosted by TWS)\nConservation of wildlife populations that migrate between countries is challenging. Not only is it difficult to predict the consequences of local conservation actions for migratory populations, but it is unknown how such information should be interpreted to inform decision making. Even with the available model-based tools informing optimal allocation of conservation funding, it is unclear how conservation mechanisms should be coordinated at an international level or among jurisdictions with differing priorities throughout the range of a migratory species. We therefore seek a better understanding of the key ecological and economic dimensions of migratory species conservation. The spatial subsidies framework offers a promising way forward. This model-based approach formally links ecological and economic information to quantify gross and net flows of ecosystem services and associated monetary benefits derived from migratory species and their habitats. This symposium presents a series of empirical case studies demonstrating the spatial subsidies framework as applied to birds, bats, and butterflies in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Focal species include the northern pintail, Mexican free-tailed bat, and monarch butterfly. The talks motivate critical needs for future research to further advance this field of integrating information from the ecological and social sciences to inform conservation of transboundary migratory species.\n8:00AM Using the Spatial Subsidies Framework for Conservation of Transboundary Ecosystem Services from Migratory Species\nTa-Ken Huang\nIn complex coupled natural-human systems, drivers of change in one location can have profound effects on human well-being in distant locations, often across international borders. Migratory species are an example of telecoupling; as they travel, they provide substantial ecosystem services for people along their migratory pathways. Because of the dynamics of migration there may be mismatches between the areas that most support a migratory species' population viability \u2013 and long term ability to provide ecosystem services \u2013 and the locations where the species provide the most services. Quantifying such telecoupled feedbacks can be achieved using the spatial subsidies approach which measures the degree to which ecosystem service provision in one location depends on habitat in another location. We have calculated spatial subsidies for three North American migratory speciesusing models of habitat distribution and dependence, and assessments of economic value of ecosystem services provided by these species. Our goal is to present managers with modeled scenarios of impacts on services and spatial subsidies to identify how they might alter land-use and conservation actions in response, and understand how the spatial subsidies concept might support the objectives of international cooperation to protect migratory species.\n8:20AM Quantifying Ecosystem Services and Spatial Subsidies from Migratory Monarch Butterflies across Multiple Scales and Countries in North America\nJay Diffendorfer\nMaking effective decisions regarding the conservation of migratory species requires knowledge of both species ecology and the socioeconomic context of their migrations. Spatial subsidies are the net ecosystem service flows for unique areas within a species' range and measure the potential spatial imbalance between the locations where people receive benefits from the species relative to locations of habitats that most support the species. We applied the spatial-subsidies framework to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration of eastern North America by structuring their annual life cycle into 5 regions that coincide with key phases of their biology. We used perturbation analyses from a Bayesian demographic matrix model, a willingness to pay survey, and analyses of volunteer time and ecotourism to parameterize our analysis. Results indicate migration and overwintering habitat in Mexico play key roles in subsidizing the cultural ecosystem services provided by monarchs in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, habitat in rural landscapes subsidizes cultural benefits from monarchs to urban residents. By factoring in the socioeconomic context, this approach can help educate stakeholders and justify the transfer of limited conservation funding to areas with the greatest potential return on investments.\n8:40AM Ecosystem Service Flows from a Migratory Species: Spatial Subsidies of the Northern Pintail\nBrady J. Mattsson\nMigratory species provide important benefits to society, but their cross-border conservation poses serious challenges. By quantifying the economic value of ecosystem services (ES) provided across a species' range and ecological data on a species' habitat dependence, we estimate spatial subsidies\u2013how particular regions support ES provided by a species across its range. We illustrate this method for the migratory northern pintail (Anas acuta) in North America. Pintails support over $101 million annually in recreational hunting and viewing and subsistence hunting in the U.S. and Canada. Pintail breeding regions provide nearly $30 million in subsidies to wintering regions, with the \"Prairie Pothole\" region supplying over $24 million in annual benefits to other regions. This information can be used to inform conservation funding allocation among migratory regions and nations on which the pintail depends. We thus illustrate a transferrable method to quantify migratory species-derived ES and provide"}
{"text":" information to aid in their transboundary conservation.\n9:00AM Land Tenure and Ecosystem Services of Migratory Bats in Mexico and the US: Who Pays Whom\nAaron Lien\nMigratory Mexican free-tailed bats provide $18M in annual ecosystem service values in limitation of damage to cotton crops and eco-tourism in the SW US and Mexico. The majority of the service values so far known are accrued in the US by bats that depend on habitat in Mexico. We map the seasonal distributions of bats onto three categories of land tenure (private, public, communal) and integrate service values with the seasonal presence of bats in US and Mexico. Our results show that bats in Mexico occupy primarily communal land. Furthermore, our results show that communal Mexico is sending benefit to private Texas. This scenario helps us to identify potential costs of land use change in critical roost and habitat and the stakeholders that benefit from them. This framework is helpful for analyzing the potential spatially explicit costs and benefits in the cross boundary, binational context.\n9:20AM Equity, Environmental Justice, and Migratory Species Conservation across International Borders\nLaura L\u00f3pez-Hoffman\nInternational conservation efforts have been widely criticized for generating inequitable outcomes by failing to support rural communities and traditional approaches to land tenure and management. Migratory species conservation illustrates this problem. As these migratory animals travel, they often provide substantial benefits and critical ecosystem services to people along their migratory pathways. Because of the dynamics of migration, there may be mismatches between the areas that most support a migratory species' population viability\u2014and long-term ability to provide ecosystem services\u2014and the locations where species provide the most services. Such distinctions between places prompt questions about who benefits from and who supports species protection. This presentation uses the spatial subsidies approach to identify equity challenges associated with the conservation of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and pintail ducks (Anas acuta). In both of these cases, the spatial subsidies approach elucidates the hidden relationships between places and inequitable distributions of ecosystem services and management obligations across space\u2014from rural to urban, from global south to north, and from indigenous to settler communities. Recognizing these relationships is critical to avoiding inequitable conservation strategies for migratory species.\nOrganizers: Brady Mattsson, Jonathan Derbridge\nSupported by: International Wildlife Management Working Group\nLocation: Reno-Sparks CC Date: October 2, 2019 Time: 8:00 am - 9:40 am"}
{"text":"Resolution 12-02F\nKyoto Protocol\nVote Results:\nCarried\nPreamble:\nWHEREAS in 1997, representatives from 160 countries met in Kyoto, Japan for the Third Conference of Parties (CoP3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and agreed to the Kyoto Protocol, which if ratified will require industrialized countries to reduce their collective emissions of greenhouse gases by the period 2008 to 2012;AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada has committed to a reduction target of 6.0% below 1990 levels by the period of 2008 to 2012, and proposes to put ratification of the plan before Parliament prior to the end of this year;AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada has released a discussion paper on Canadas Contribution to Addressing Climate Change, but has not prepared a detailed plan to show what measures will be implemented to meet the targeted goals as contemplated in the Kyoto Protocol (the Discussion Paper does stress the importance of developing a workable plan in full consultation with provinces, territories, stakeholders and Canadians);AND WHEREAS the United States, Canadas most important trading partner, is opposed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol because of the negative economic impact the agreement would have on their country, leaving Canada as potentially the only country in the Western Hemisphere committed to the greenhouse gas emission targets identified in the Kyoto Protocol, thus raising serious competitiveness issues for Canada and Canadian industry;AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada has examined policy options to address implementation of climate change, and these options negatively affect the economy of the province of Alberta;\nOperative Clause:\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties urge the Government of Canada to delay any vote on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol until the commitment to develop a workable implementation plan in consultation with all provinces, territories, stakeholders and Canadians has been fulfilled.AND FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED that the AAMDC urge the Government of Alberta to pursue all legal and legislative options available to counteract ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the federal government, unless the Province of Alberta is satisfied that a fair implementation plan has been developed, that fairly addresses the potential negative impact on the economy of the Province of Alberta.\nMember Background:\nIn December of 1997, representatives from 160 countries met in Kyoto, Japan for the Third Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and agreed to the Kyoto Protocol. At the subsequent Fourth Conference held in Argentina in 1998, Parties adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Under the plan, parties further agreed to strengthen the implementation of the convention and prepare for the future entry into force of the Protocol.The Kyoto Protocol defines three specific market-based mechanisms (Kyoto mechanisms), that will provide developed countries with flexibility to meet reduction targets in a manner that balances economic efficiency and environmental integrity.The three Kyoto mechanisms include:1. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which enables industrialized countries to finance emission-reduction projects in developing countries and share emission-reduction credit for doing so;2. Emissions Trading (ET) which permits industrialized countries to meet their commitments by buying and selling excess credits among themselves; and3. Joint Implementation (JI) which allows industrialized countries to meet their commitments with the sharing of emission-reduction credits.Greenhouse gases are invisible and are not associated with smog or other types of visible air pollution. The most abundant greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane. While these gases naturally occur in the atmosphere, the concentrations of these gases beyond natural levels is expected to cause global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) established by the World Meteorological Organization assessed the scientific research on climate change. They established three key findings:1. Human activities are changing the composition of the atmosphere. Predictions are that by the end of the century, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere will be at least double what it had been prior to the industrial revolution.2. The changes in the concentration of CO2 are affecting and will continue to affect the global climate; and3. The changes consistent with global warming are already occurring in some parts of the world. The 20th century was estimated to be the warmest century of the last millennium, and the 1990s were the warmest decade of the last century.The industrialized countries of the world have agreed that, having contributed most to the problem to date and having the resources to act, they should take the lead with respect to addressing it. To this end, the Kyoto Protocol comes into force when it has been ratified by 55 nations representing at least 55% of the industrial countries 1990 CO2 emissions.Canada as a country is responsible for only about 2% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, but is the ninth largest emitter nation. Business as usual projections would see Canadas greenhouse gas emissions rise to approximately 809 MT by 2010. Canadas Kyoto Protocol target is 571 MT by 2010. Alberta is expected to pay the highest economic price within Canada because of the production of energy and"}
{"text":" use of coal to produce electricity.Agriculture and forestry currently account for about 10% of Canadas greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of these emissions are from non-energy sources, and both industries have the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Sustainable agriculture practices improve the capacity of soils to retain or even absorb CO2. Nitrous oxides from fertilizers and manure and methane from livestock are estimated to account for 96% of agricultures greenhouse gas emissions. Targeted measures to reduce GHG could include: Rebates on soil testing and one-time payments to change fertilizer options; Encouraging conservation tillage through incentive programs; Improving grazing management by providing incentives to bring more land under improved management regimes, and Reducing nitrous oxide emissions from livestock by providing some reimbursement of the cost of feed analysis.In the Discussion Paper on Canadas Contribution to addressing Climate Change the Government of Canada identified two important conditions. First, there must be a workable plan, and secondly, such a plan must be developed in full consultation with provinces, territories, stakeholders and Canadians. Canadas challenge, while working in a void without participation from the United States, is seen to be to develop a plan that is affordable, a plan where no region of the country is asked to bear an unreasonable burden, a plan that promotes innovation and addresses issues to the competitiveness of Canadian Industry, and a plan that takes into account the complexity and long-term nature of climate change.It is apparent that this challenge has not been met, as many Canadians and Albertans struggle to understand the impact of the Kyoto Protocol.\nRMA Background:\nThe AAMDC has no resolutions currently in effect with respect to this issue. However, the AAMDC board has given its support to the Government of Albertas efforts to develop a made in Canada approach to greenhouse gas reduction, and has advised various federal ministers of the associations concerns regarding the economic impact of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.\nBack to Resolutions Database"}

As homeowners prepare for an above-average hurricane season in 2020, they aren't getting the information they need to protect themselves,\" said Ralph Blust, CEO at National Flood Services. \"There's a vast information gap \u2014 flood is three times more likely than fire to impact a home over the course of a 30-year mortgage, yet homeowners are over six times more likely to be protected from fire than flood.\"\nIn addition, the survey found:\n74 percent of U.S. adults claim they're \"not at risk for flooding\" and therefore \"don't need flood insurance.\" (In reality, 128 million Americans were at risk of flooding this spring alone.)\n51 percent of U.S. adults \"have no idea\" what they or their household would do if they experienced a flood.\n77 percent of Americans say they would not buy flood insurance online, with many saying they'd prefer to work with an agent.\nOnly 6 percent of homeowners making under $50,000 have flood insurance.\nOnly 6 percent of homeowners between the ages of 55 and 64 have flood insurance\nAhead of a hurricane season in which researchers predict 16 major storms and eight hurricanes, four of which are forecast to be major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5), flood insurance can help homeowners prepare for the devastating financial impacts of flooding.\n\"These numbers represent a huge opportunity for insurers to look out for the well-being of their customers,\" Blust said. \"By first educating them on what they can do to mitigate their exposure to flood risks, then offering an intuitive, tech-enabled experience to protect their homes and families, insurers can help keep their customers safe while preparing them for when disaster strikes.\"\nAbout National Flood Services\nFor over 35 years, National Flood Services has worked with the country's top insurance providers to help protect homeowners from the costly impact of flooding. In support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and write-your-own insurance companies, National Flood Services manages over $1.4 billion of annual premiums and more than 1.8 million policies, furthering its mission of improving people's lives by reducing the damaging impact of flooding.\nNational Flood Services is a portfolio company of PEAK6, a Chicago-based operating company that specializes in technology investments.\nTo learn more about National Flood Services, visit www.nationalfloodservices.com.\nThe survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of National Flood Services from April 28-30, 2020.

{"text":"Counting Carbon: Understanding Carbon Footprints of Buildings\nBy Nadav Malin, Environmental Building News\nThis article is reprinted from Environmental Building News and BuildingGreen Suite, with permission. You may view the original at www.BuildingGreen.com\nVolumes representing one metric ton of three common building materials (small cubes), along with the volume of the carbon dioxide typically released to produce those materials (larger cubes)\nHistorically the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere hovered just under 300 parts per million (ppm), but it's now approaching 400 ppm. CO2 is not the most powerful of the greenhouse gases on a per-molecule basis\u2014not by a long shot\u2014but it is by far the most common and most significant of those generated by humans. Various targets have been proposed as acceptable levels of CO2, most famously 450 ppm, above which the resultant temperature rise would likely cause extreme disruption to Earth's ecological and social systems. Many policy initiatives give lip service to this goal, but current actions are inadequate to reach it. Based on more recent scientific findings, author Bill McKibben has launched a campaign to reset that target at 350 ppm, a point we passed in 1988. That's a much more ambitious goal, but one that, if achieved, would more likely lead to a future climate that resembles our own.\nRegardless of the target, there is general agreement that we have to slow the growth in carbon emissions and then shrink those emissions. As researchers seek ways to reduce human-generated carbon emissions at a cost that society will accept, buildings consistently emerge as the best opportunity. \"Buildings are the biggest and lowest-hanging fruit in dealing with greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" says architect and researcher Hal Levin, who chairs the Project Committee on Carbon Emissions Tool Development of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Since carbon emissions from buildings generally follow energy use, we'll go a long way simply by making buildings more energy efficient.\nBut energy use, whether it's measured in dollars or kilowatt-hours, in absolute terms or as a percent reduction against code, is not exactly a measure of carbon emissions. How energy is generated and distributed changes how much carbon is released in the process. And energy used in the building is not the whole picture when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. What you count and how you count it can change both the answers you get and what you do about them.\nWhat to Count\nUnits of Carbon\nSeveral related metrics are used to describe greenhouse gas emissions. The most common measurement is the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2), in pounds in the U.S. and in kilograms or metric tons internationally. Until recently, U.S. government documents t\u2026\nEmissions from energy used in building operations are the obvious place to start in measuring a building's carbon footprint, but stopping there leaves many emission sources off the table, such as emissions from transportation to and from the building, providing water to the building, and creating the building itself. These other sources grow in relative significance as the building's operations get more efficient: \"The more you improve the energy performance, the more your carbon footprint is dominated by transportation,\" notes Christopher Pyke, Ph.D., director of climate change services at CTG Energetics, based in Irvine, California.\nWhich carbon sources you attribute to the building depends largely on why you are counting. Many carbon-accounting schemes are driven by efforts to regulate emissions or monetize emission reductions, so they focus on careful assignment of emissions to a variety of owners in a way that avoids double-counting. \"Their fundamental interest is to take the entire economy and add up how much carbon is in it,\" notes Pyke. \"But from the point of view of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, ownership is not that important.\" In its work for the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) on the LEED 2009 weightings tool (see EBN Vol. 17, No. 6), CTG's primary interest was asking, \"What does the building provide in terms of opportunities for reducing emissions?\" said Pyke. Hence transportation-related impacts are included in the tool, even though the building owner can't claim ownership of those emissions or cash in on reductions.\nCarbon emission estimates based on energy models and other predictive tools are useful, but they aren't sufficient for carbon accounting schemes, according to Pyke. \"We're going to plan based on models, but we'll regulate and manage based on data,\" he says. That doesn't mean that models won't play a role in regulations, however. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants, there is a growing trend to include carbon emissions as part of the environmental impact statement that is filed for permitting and approvals, according to Sean Cryan, associate principal at Mithun Architects + Design"}
{"text":"ers + Planners. These requirements, beginning in California, Massachusetts, and western Washington State, have created a demand for new tools to predict the carbon impacts of new projects and whole developments.\nCO2 has captured our attention, but it is certainly not the only air-pollutant from building-related activities. Some of the tools described below also quantify emissions of sulfur dioxide (which causes acid rain), smog-generating nitrous oxides, and other pollutants.\nOperational energy use\nU.S. National Average Fuel Mix for Generating Electricity\nEnergy used onsite is the most direct, and typically the most significant, contributor to a building's carbon footprint. This energy usually arrives at the building in the form of electricity and natural gas or other fossil fuels, such as fuel oil or propane. Each of these fuels has a carbon footprint, so if you know the type and amount of fuel consumed, you can estimate the building's primary contribution to greenhouse gases.\nElectricity is the most common form of energy used onsite. Power plants generate this electricity with a range of fuels, each of which emits a different amount of carbon. Unfortunately, half of the electricity in the U.S. is generated by burning coal, which is the most carbon-intensive fuel (see chart). As a result, buildings in areas of the country where electricity is generated primarily from coal have a higher carbon footprint than those in other regions, even if they are equally energy efficient.\nMost tools that convert electricity use to carbon emissions rely on EPA's Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), which is also the basis for EPA's online Power Profiler. This database provides average annual emissions of carbon and other pollutants for each power plant in the U.S. based on the mix of fuels used by that utility to generate electricity.\nVisualizing the volume represented by one metric ton of carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and pressure makes that quantity more real for non-scientists\nMacroscale models of carbon emissions consider the transportation sector separately from the buildings sector. Many building-related strategies can reduce energy use and emissions from transportation, however; they range from locating buildings in pedestrian- and transit-friendly places to designing them with pedestrians and cyclists in mind (see EBN Vol. 16, No. 9). Automobile use is often measured in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), and converting VMT to gallons or liters of fuel depends on the efficiency of the vehicles\u2014the average passenger car in the U.S. achieves 22 miles per gallon (10 liters\/100 km). Gasoline contributes about 19.4 pounds of CO2 per gallon (2.3 kg\/l), according to EPA. A more difficult question is whether, for carbon-accounting purposes, those miles should be pinned on where a person lives or on where she works or shops. Fortunately, we don't have to solve that riddle to encourage carbon-reducing strategies.\nThe energy used to treat and transport potable water is substantial, especially in dry regions. Pumping water over the Tehachapi Mountains from Northern to Southern California represents an extreme case: the energy used to deliver water to Southern California homes amounts to about one-third as much as the average electricity used in each of those homes, according to a 2005 report from the Pacific Institute.\nThis energy can be translated to carbon emissions, but the relative importance varies widely. In USGBC's LEED 2009 credit weighting tool, water use at the typical 135,000-ft2 (12,500-m2)office building accounts for anywhere from 5 to 823 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), depending on how much water the building uses\u2014which is driven largely by the size of irrigated landscape area\u2014and how much energy it takes to deliver that water. Compared with operating energy calculated using USGBC's median building-systems scenario, the carbon from a building's water use ranges from 0.17% to 29% of the carbon associated with operating energy.\nThese numbers do not account for methane released from wastewater treatment plants, which can be significant if the plant uses anaerobic digestion and doesn't capture its methane. \"Some sewage facilities actually have data on how much methane is released,\" reports Rod Bates, environmental researcher at KieranTimberlake Associates, although in his experience they are more likely to have good data if they are capturing and reusing the methane.\nThis graph shows the relative carbon content in soil and in vegetation for various ecosystems measured in kilograms per square meter of area\nBefore environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) became widespread, the environmental impact of materials in a building was often estimated based on their embodied energy, meaning the energy used to make and transport those materials. LCA tools provide a more directly relevant metric in the form of \"global warming impact\" CO2e. This measure adds to the energy picture by including things like carbon dioxide released from minerals as limestone is turned into portland cement, and"}
{"text":" methane released from the digestive systems of sheep as they grow wool. (Wool carpet is much worse than synthetics on a climate-change basis for this reason.)\nIt is also possible to estimate emission reductions that come from recycling construction waste (and from recycling by occupants). The reductions are primarily from avoiding the need to manufacture virgin materials when recycled-content materials are available instead. EPA has an online calculator and downloadable spreadsheet that can help estimate these savings. While it is not designed specifically for construction waste, it does include many of the material categories that are encountered on construction sites, including corrugated cardboard, lumber, bricks, and carpet. See www.epa.gov\/climatechange\/wycd\/waste\/calculators\/Warm_home.html.\nConstruction Carbon Calculators\nBuild Carbon Neutral combines on-site energy use with data on the CO2 emissions in the materials drawn from the Athena Institute's Impact Estimator for Buildings and from estimates of carbon released from soils during construction. It offers an over\u2026\n\"Carbon embodied in a building typically represents 13% to 18% of the carbon emissions over the life of the building,\" says Cryan. This estimate includes CO2 emitted while manufacturing and transporting materials, as described above, as well as activities on the construction site, including emissions from running construction equipment and the release of carbon that had been sequestered in the soil. \"We spent a long time figuring out the carbon associated with moving a cubic yard of soil,\" reports Cryan.\nResearchers have measured carbon sequestered in various soil types, but precise numbers are questionable when it comes to releases of sequestered carbon because so little is known about what really happens to soil-based carbon on a construction site. \"Whatever they're assuming is pure guess,\" suggests Steven Hamburg, Ph.D., of Brown University, about efforts to include this information in a simple calculator. Nevertheless, both Hamburg and Cryan suggest the same design responses: minimizing the size of development footprints, increasing the density of neighborhoods, and protecting natural areas from development.\nHow to Count\nBased on the simplified method described in the sidebar for estimating carbon emissions from operating energy, any energy simulation can be used to predict carbon impacts. Increasingly, energy modeling tools have this capability built in, with output reports that include predicted carbon emissions alongside the predicted energy use.\nResults from energy modeling tools\nThe Quick-and-Dirty Carbon Footprint Calculation\nSome energy-modeling software now provides results in pounds of CO2 alongside the Btus and kilowatt-hours. If you don't have those results but know your building's actual or estimated consumption of electricity and other fuels, you can plug those num\u2026\nIn June 2008 Integrated Environmental Solutions, Ltd., released VE-Ware, a free plug-in for Autodesk's Revit Architecture and Revit MEP software that generates a carbon footprint report for a modeled building. Carbon-emission reports are already built into EnergyPlus, which now has an energy simulation plug-in available for Google SketchUp and for Green Building Studio, a Web-based energy simulation service that was recently acquired by Autodesk. The translation from building information models (BIMs) created for design and construction purposes to models that can be used for energy simulations is rapidly improving, but it is not yet seamless, especially for complex buildings and detailed designs. As those connections improve, carbon footprint estimates should increasingly be available throughout the design process at the click of a button.\nAs a quick test of these tools, designers at KlingStubbins created a simple core-and-shell Revit model of a three-story building in Boston and generated an energy and carbon report using both Green Building Studio and VE-Ware. The results were \"uncannily close,\" according to Jason Olsen, an associate involved in the experiment. Both systems use gbXML as the protocol for transferring data to the simulation tool, but the underlying energy simulation engines are different, and the assumptions the tools made about the breakdown between electricity and natural gas were also somewhat different. Additional testing against models generated in a more controlled way by experienced engineers would be advised, but this single test indicates that these tools may already provide useful carbon-footprint feedback, at least from early design models.\nCounting the Electricity Grid\nThis map shows the subregions of the United States electric utility grid, along with the carbon intensity of electricity production in each subregion in pounds of CO2 per thousand kilowatt hours, as stored in the Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) for 2004\nA big piece of nearly every building's carbon footprint comes from the electricity it uses, so how you translate kilowatt-hours into tons of CO2 is important. This is not a simple translation, however. Complicating factors include the way power is shared throughout large regions, variations in emission profiles from electricity generation over time, and the difference between reporting based on historical power profiles and that based on projected future conditions.\nHow tightly"}
{"text":" to define the grid?\nEPA's Power Profiler and many other tools estimate carbon emissions for electricity use as reported in eGRID for the electricity subregion in which the building is located. EPA divides the U.S. into 26 such subregions, and each has its own fuel mix and emissions profile. The Pacific Northwest, for example, has a lot of hydropower, so its emissions are relatively clean. The mountain states, on the other hand, rely primarily on coal, resulting in lots of carbon and other emissions. These variations make an inefficient building in Seattle look better in terms of carbon emissions than a high-performing building in Denver.\nOne could conclude that it's more important to build low-energy buildings in Denver than in Seattle, but that's not the whole story, according to Michael Deru, Ph.D., of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, because power is transported throughout a much wider region to meet demand: \"If you use more energy in Seattle, you're using hydro, but you're causing more coal to be burned,\" Deru says, noting that if hydropower were not needed in Seattle, it would be transferred to a part of the grid where it could offset electricity generated from fossil fuels. Deru argues that we need to minimize nonrenewable energy use nationwide, so it's better to use national average values for carbon intensity of electricity. If not national values, he suggests using values based on the large regions defined by how the nation's utility grids are interconnected. The continental U.S. has three of these interconnected regions, one each for the eastern and western halves of the country, and a third covering most of Texas.\nA related issue is the question of focusing on existing generation rather than the additional (marginal) capacity that is needed to meet new demand. Some argue that it makes more sense to estimate the carbon footprint of a new building based on this marginal capacity. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, no new hydropower dams are being built, so most new loads are being met with fossil-fuel or nuclear plants. Some would argue, then, that it is not reasonable to allow new buildings to take credit for existing hydropower in their carbon footprints.\nTime-of-use impacts\nEven within a small region, emissions from electricity generation vary by time of day, by season, and from one year to another. Because power is in short supply during peak times (usually daytime) and is readily available at other times, incentives exist specifically to shift the demand for electricity from day to night. California's Title 24 energy code includes factors for time of use for this reason.\nIce storage is a typical example of this strategy: chillers are run at night to make ice, which is used during the day to cool a building so the chillers can sit idle. But whether these measures reduce carbon emissions depends on various factors, such as which fuels are used to generate power under which conditions. California relies heavily on natural gas for its base-load power, so the electricity it buys to meet peak loads is dirtier, notes Hal Levin. But in South Dakota, where the base load is met by coal, \"they are often buying cleaner electricity for peak conditions,\" Levin says.\nA more difficult type of variation to track and design for is the availability of hydropower, which in many places depends on snowpack in the mountains, according to Levin. That resource changes both through the year and from one year to another.\nEven power from the same fossil-fuel-powered plant can vary in its emission profile based on ambient temperatures and how that plant is operated. At night, when the air is cooler and demand is low, operations can be optimized for efficiency, according to Deru. During the day, however, the need to meet constantly changing demand leads to compromises that increase emissions.\nASHRAE is working on a tool that will take into account regional and time-of-use variations in the electricity grid, and other factors, to provide more accurate carbon-footprint estimates. Because standard energy simulation software models energy use in buildings on at least an hourly basis, this tool\u2014due out in 2009\u2014is intended to use that hourly data to predict carbon emissions.\nUpstream emissions of fuels\nCombustion and Precombustion Emissions of Greenhouse Gases From Heating Fuels\nIt takes energy to extract, refine, and deliver fuels to a building or to a power plant. These \"precombustion effects\" can account for anywhere from 5% to 20% of the total emissions associated with each fuel used in a building (see table), according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's U.S. Life-Cycle Inventory Database. When it comes to fuels used at power plants to generate electricity, it is not as easy to compare precombustion carbon emissions with carbon emissions from fuel content, especially for sources such as nuclear and renewable energy, which have low or no combustion-related emissions.\nOf all the fuels,"}
{"text":" precombustion CO2e emissions are highest for natural gas, largely because of the high global warming potential of gas that leaks from pipelines. Overall emissions, including both precombustion and combustion effects for nonrenew-able fuels, range from about 2 pounds of CO2e per million Btus for nuclear energy to 225 pounds for coal.\nThe estimates for nuclear energy are hotly debated, with some arguing that as the quality of available uranium declines, more energy will be needed to process it. Also, even where estimates of precombustion effects are available, the long-term energy and environmental cost of processing and storing waste nuclear fuel are still not taken into account.\nGreenhouse Gases By Energy Content of Power Plant Fuels\nWith all the complexities and efforts to refine our estimates, it's easy to lose track of the fact that we can reduce carbon emissions dramatically by doing things that we already know about. Variations in the electrical grid and in fuel choices notwithstanding, reducing energy use also reduces emissions. Beyond that simple point, here are a few things to keep in mind.\nDurability of reductions\nIf design and construction strategies that we implement today are going to help us meet carbon emission goals in 2020 or beyond, those strategies have to be robust and durable. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is a fundamental difference between, for example, orienting a building properly and sealing ducts. The former should last as long as the building; the latter, on the other hand, may have a dramatic short-term benefit, but \"How tight do the ducts stay?\" asks Pyke. This distinction won't show up in an energy model, but it's worth considering when evaluating which strategies to implement on a project. Rather than investing in sealing ducts, it's better to design the building so that all ducts are contained in the conditioned space, so slight leaks are not a problem.\nThis distinction is even more obvious when it comes to the nebulous world of carbon offsets. An owner may decide that reducing carbon emissions from operations is too complicated and might choose instead to purchase carbon offsets or renewable energy credits with a low carbon load. But even if one accepts that buying offsets is as effective as directly reducing emissions (which few experts do), that purchasing policy can easily be reversed in the future, so it isn't nearly as compelling a solution for long-term climate change concerns.\nOther policy-related solutions are similarly vulnerable. Providing mass-transit passes to employees is certainly laudable and beneficial, but it reduces a building's carbon footprint only if the employees use those passes and only for as long as they are available. Structural solutions like limiting the amount of parking may be more durable over time, in that they can survive changes in management philosophy.\nHistorical vs. future-based predictions\nEstimates of carbon dioxide embodied in the structural materials for four common structural systems\nMeasures that shift electric power demand from peak to off-peak times may not directly reduce CO2 emissions, but they may do that indirectly. By reducing peak loads they help prevent or delay the construction of additional power plants. If the plants are not built, the business case for investing in conservation is much stronger than if the power is readily available as excess capacity.\nThat factor is one of many ways in which changes to the economy and to the environment over time may change the long-term impacts of decisions we make today. Anticipating these changes is tricky, so perhaps the smartest response is to maintain some flexibility in design solutions. This kind of thinking is not new to architects, notes Levin: \"We always look at that tradeoff in building design between optimization and flexibility.\"\nKieranTimberlake has learned a lot by measuring and seeking to minimize its own carbon footprint, according to Bates. \"We monitor our own activities, and it allows us to use ourselves as a test bed for different types of strategies,\" he says. It also helps to have clients who are inspired to reduce their emissions\u2014that provides KieranTimberlake with the incentive to do the research and improve the performance of its designs. But that conversation goes both ways: \"A key factor is communicating to the clients, in a language they can understand, what emissions are associated with their buildings,\" Bates suggests, adding that his firm converts carbon emissions into the equivalent vehicles on the road or acres of forest needed to offset those emissions. When clients can relate to the impacts in that way, they are more likely to support the effort. EPA has a handy online calculator for translating emissions into units that people can relate to at: www.epa.gov\/cleanenergy\/energy-resources\/calculator.html.\nWith his 2030 Challenge, architect Edward Mazria, AIA, has invigorated the design professions to respond to climate change. While Mazria has chosen to emphasize a reduction in fossil-fuel energy use as his metric, the building industry as a whole is learning that it's important to measure and understand more than one number as we strive for more"}

Amita Sharma\/KPBS)\nOver 20 percent of the children living in Barrio Logan have asthma. That's nearly triple the national average. And the rate of hospitalization for asthma in this community is 54 percent higher than the county average.\nAlejandara Baza of Barrio Logan worries her three-year-old daughter you just heard might get the chronic lung disease. Her 11-year-old son was recently diagnosed with asthma. He carries an inhaler in his backpack. She's convinced her family's health troubles are connected to port-related business and she feels powerless.\n\"Powerlessness- I feel powerless. My kids want to go outside and run and exercise and you go outside and start sneezing. You go outside and start coughing,\" says Baza.\nThe Environmental Health Coalition says not all of the asthma in Barrio Logan can be blamed on the port of San Diego's 10th Avenue Marine Terminal. But the group says it's a huge contributor. A thousand trucks a week pass through the terminal.\nJust feet away from the Mercado Apartments where Baza lives, trucks carrying port cargo idle on the street for hours preparing to enter a distribution center \u2026. all the while releasing emissions containing toxic pollutants like benzene and tiny particles. When those fine particles get into the lungs, they can create serious health problems.\nThe black soot from the diesel fumes covers the inside of Alejandra's apartment each day.

He says he's focused on cleaning up port pollution in Barrio Logan.\n\"This is the biggest environmental justice issue going on right now,\" says Peters.\nBut what happens if the port doesn't receive federal stimulus money? The Environmental Health Coalition says it expects the port to move ahead with ship electrification regardless.\nThere is also supposed to be relief on the way for residents with diesel-churning trucks travelling through their neighborhoods. New standards require diesel trucks to have cleaner engines by next year. But the port says state funding for that project has been frozen\u2026although it will continue with the program using its own money.\nIn the meantime, Alejandra Baza says she contemplates moving her family out of their apartment.

{"text":"There's no ROI in CSR...?\nThere's no ROI in CSR\u2026?\nA recent issue of Catalyst, the journal of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, included an article entitled \"Get What you Give\". The article proposed that philanthropy in Corporate Social Responsibility should be scrapped in favour of 'Brand Citizenship' \u2013 which would mean only supporting causes that could be directly and obviously linked to the business, and this connection needs to be \"walk-by understandable\" by the consumer.\nThe rationale was that this would help move away from 'giving in secret', which, it maintains, does not benefit the giver and would make justification to the Board simpler. This simplistic, and somewhat selfish, linking of an direct ROI measure to CSR concerns me and, I believe, actually doesn't address the underlying issue anyway.\nNew technologies, innovative channels and interactive media will cause an explosion in ground-breaking new practices.\nCompanies will seek long-term profits from their corporate giving and align their activity with something \"meaningful\" for the business.\nLarge-scale, multi-stakeholder coalitions will harness collective skills and drive transformational change.\nBillions of consumers will be mobilised to give up their time, second hand items and fresh ideas to community causes.\nWhile it is undoubtedly good to benefit any worthwhile causes as part of a CSR strategy I think that there are dangers with only donating to those with an obvious connection to the business success.\nFirstly, over time, this could lead to development of two tiers of worthy causes \u2013 those that benefit because of their obvious links to companies and those that don't. Look what has happened to big pharmaceutical drug research over the years \u2013 money poured into finding cures for diseases of the wealthy but not into third-world problems.\nSecondly, I actually think that the rise of consumer preferences for defining their own social 'worthiness' by shopping with brands that are socially responsible will benefit those business who actually give to causes that are not obviously linked. Many consumers would look with suspicion on brands donating to obviously directly benefit themselves. It is perfectly possible to improve PR and awareness to ensure that philanthropic giving is seen as positive by consumers \u2013 this would address the issue of 'giving in secret' while still benefiting from an image of giving for good reasons rather than a direct financial return.\nThe fourth trend in the Charities Trust list talks about Companies facilitating large scale donations through \"movement fundraising\". While providing an infrastructure to enable consumers to donate is worthy, and good causes will benefit, is this really 'CSR'? When I put a can of baked beans in the donations basket at my local supermarket it is me that is giving, not the supermarket. It is my philanthropy \u2013 not theirs.\nI believe that the future should be to develop business models that have at their heart the strategy of benefitting good causes, not as an afterthought but as a central core value. Numbers 1 and 3 on the Charities Trust list are absolutely the key trends that can drive this development. New technologies (trend number 1) will enable collaborative coalitions (trend number 3), and in the words of the report \"Corporate giving will build loyal and effective working relationships with customers, suppliers, not for-profits and government agencies. Collaboration, including with competitors, will amplify impact and a philosophy of social action will emerge. Big businesses are going to be bigger stakeholders in 'fixing' the world. The setting aside of competitive differences will benefit both commercial organisations (in terms of enhanced reputation), and the causes they serve.\nThis view of the responsibilities of businesses to wider society was a key driving force for CEO Martin Kelly in setting up INNOVO as a unique B2B marketplace that benefits good causes as a standard part of its business processes. See him describe it in his own words \u2013 watch this video on INNOVO for Good.\nWith some evidence of the increasing value placed by consumers on doing good, do you see an increasing role for corporates in charitable giving? How do you think it could be woven into the fabric of business? Is this a new area for commercial innovation?

And, while most fans will be focused on what's happening on-the-field, there's another storyline already forming off of it. Many NFL stadiums are scoring big on energy savings and tackling waste at the same time\u2014adding even more value to the game day experience.\n\"These iconic stadiums are using the most innovative technologies and strategies today to save energy and water,\" said Jason Hartke of the Building Technologies Office, who spearheaded a recent U.S. Department of Energy report examining how sports teams and venues can save energy. \"They're not just demonstrating great leadership in efficiency, they're spreading the word to millions of people across the country.\"\nNFL stadiums are some of the largest sport venues in America. Many of them are more than one million square feet and are in the top 0.1%, by size, of all U.S. commercial buildings. This means they require large amounts of operating energy\u2014but also provide plenty of opportunities for savings.\nHere is how five teams are tackling energy:\nMetLife Stadium consumes 30% less energy than the stadium it replaced in 2010.\nMetLife Stadium, home to the New York Giants and Jets, was named one of the top 10 most energy efficient stadiums by Energy Digital. Despite being twice as large as the old Giants Stadium it replaced in 2010, MetLife Stadium consumes 30% less energy thanks to LED lighting and lighting controls that are powered by a \"solar ring\" of 1,350 solar panels. The stadium also boasts energy-efficient windows, ENERGYSTAR office equipment, kitchen appliances, and concession equipment, and HVAC technologies that reduce energy demand and maintain performance for its refrigerators and chilled water air conditioning.\nThe New York Jet's Atlantic Health Training Facility also saves energy through 3,000 solar panels, improved heating and cooling system operation, real-time power monitoring, and a three-phased LED lighting and controls project that is replacing all parking lot, roadway, interior fixtures and roof hanging field house lights with more efficient LED fixtures.\nCenturyLink Field\nCenturyLink Field reduced energy costs by 21% over the last decade despite growing its vistor attendance.\nCenturyLink Field, home of the Seattle Seahawks, implemented a robust sustainability program over the last decade, resulting in a 21% reduction in annual energy costs\u2014even in the face of rising visitor attendance. The stadium uses high-efficiency lighting and point-of-use lighting controls in concession stands, restrooms, and storage spaces to make sure lighting is only on when needed. It also installed more than 3,500 solar panels that generate electricity equivalent to the amount needed to power 95 Seattle-area homes for an entire year. The stadium also uses a cool roof to reduce heat absorption and building energy costs.\nLincoln Financial Field\nLincoln Financial Field has reduced its energy bills by 33% and supplies more than 4 times the power it uses during a season of home games.\nLincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, is considered one of the \"greenest\" stadiums in the world. Its on-site renewable energy (produced by more than 11,000 solar panels and 14 wind turbines) supplies more than four times the power used during a season of home games. Through a variety of conservation programs, such as an improved building management system and a properly evaluated commissioning of the building, the team was able to reduce its energy bills by 33%. They also saved up to 5 years in electric costs thanks in part to new occupancy-based lighting controls.\nM&T Bank Stadium is 27% more energy efficient than the national average.\nStadiums of Pro Football\nM&T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens, is the first existing stadium to be LEED Gold certified. The stadium is 27% more energy efficient than the national average and reduced its electricity use from 2005-2012 by 5 million kilowatt-hours\u2014equivalent to the energy needed to heat 440 homes for an entire year. The stadium also follows a sustainable purchasing policy that requires all purchases to include recycled, renewable, and ENERGYSTAR labeled products for the building. In 2016, M&T Bank Stadium installed more than 1,200 solar panels on"}
{"text":" its field house and grounds-keeping buildings. The recent additions should generate roughly 15% of the team's electricity needs.\nMercedes-Benz Stadium is expected to save 29% in energy use compared to a typical stadium design.\nMercedes-Benz Stadium, the new home of the Atlanta Falcons, was designed with energy efficiency and clean energy in mind. The stadium will save 29% in energy usage compared to a typical stadium design, which the team anticipates could save close to $900,000 in annual savings.\nThe stadium's retractable roof and energy-efficient floor-to-roof glass on the concourses maximizes natural light which, alongside LED lighting, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, and building control systems, should drastically reduce electricity usage compared to typical stadiums.\nMercedes-Benz stadium is also built to catch more than 1 million gallons of rainwater, which will not only help address a long-standing flooding concern in Atlanta's Westside neighborhood, but will also be used for irrigation and the stadium's cooling system. More than 4,000 solar panels have also been installed at Mercedes-Benz stadium, which should generate enough energy to power nine Falcon home games.\nCheck out the report to see how your home team is working to use cutting-edge energy efficiency technologies and strategies to minimize their energy usage.\nAbout eere\nContact EERE"}

Neil Craik\nNeil Craik is a CIGI senior fellow with the International Law Research Program, effective June 2015. He is an associate professor at the University of Waterloo with appointments to the Balsillie School of International Affairs and the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development, where he teaches and researches in the fields of international and Canadian environmental law.\nWil Burns\nWil Burns is a CIGI senior fellow with the International Law Research Program, effective July 2015. Until recently, he served as director of the Energy Policy & Climate Program at Johns Hopkins University, and now serves as co-director of the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment, a scholarly initiative of the School of International Service at American University in Washington, DC.\nWhile the Paris Agreement does not address the issue of climate engineering expressly, the target of limiting global average temperature rise to no more than 2\u00b0C (a goal that appears unlikely to be achieved in the absence of significant amounts of carbon removal) raises questions with respect to how the issue of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) technologies may be addressed under the Paris Agreement. This report examines the specific provisions of the Paris Agreement with a view to identifying where legal and policy questions in relation to climate engineering are likely to arise. Inclusion of CDR technologies as part of a state's nationally determined contributions (NDCs) is permissible under article 4 of the Paris Agreement, but will likely trigger concerns respecting technological readiness and equity. SRM technologies would appear to have little entry room within the Paris Agreement, but the process mechanism of the agreement provides opportunities to satisfy SRM research governance demands for transparency and public deliberation. The report concludes that the building blocks for an internationally integrated approach to climate engineering law and policy are faintly present in the Paris Agreement's procedural and institutional capacities. As research activities generate a clearer understanding of the feasibility of CDR and SRM technologies, bringing the science to bear on the normative commitments to equity, human rights and the nature of climate change as an issue of common concern will be critical to realizing a broader coherence in global climate policy under the Paris Agreement.\nRead the full report here.\nNew CIGI Report \u2013 The Paris Agreement and Climate Geoengineering Governance: The Need For a Human-rights Based Component\nDr. Wil Burns, a Scholar in Residence at AU's School of International Service and co-director of the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment, has authored a new report for the Center for International Governance Innovation titled \"The Paris Agreement and Climate Geoengineering Governance: The Need For a Human-rights Based Component.\"\n\"There has been growing recognition in the past decade at both the international and domestic levels of the potential ramifications of climate change for the exercise of human rights. Even more recently, the locus of concern has expanded to include the human rights implications of response measures to confronting climate change. The newly adopted Paris Agreement includes language that calls on its parties to consider, respect and promote the protection of human rights when taking actions to address climate change. However, the agreement fails to suggest specific means to operationalize this mandate.\nThis paper"}
{"text":" suggests a framework for achieving the objective of protecting human rights in the context of climate change response measures. It focuses on one suite of emerging potential measures that fall under the general rubric of \"climate geoengineering,\" which is defined as efforts to effectuate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment through technological options in order to counteract the manifestations of climate change. The paper suggests that the parties to the Paris Agreement utilize a human rights-based approach as a framing mechanism to ensure that the potential human rights implications of climate geoengineering options are assessed in the policy-making process moving forward. Such an approach may help to ensure that any potential negative ramifications of climate geoengineering options on the human rights interests of the world's most vulnerable peoples are taken into account and minimized. Moreover, this analysis might help us to flesh out more broadly the contours of the new human rights language in the Paris Agreement.\"\nRead the full report here!\nUnited States\u2013Cuba Agricultural Relations and Agrarian Questions\nDr. T.

{"text":"Plant-Based Meats Are More Popular Than Ever\nBut are they actually sustainable?\nBeyond Meat \"Beyond Burger\" patties are seen on a grocery store shelf in New York City on Nov. 15, 2019. Angela Weiss\/AFP via Getty Images\nThis story was originally published by Canada's National Observer and has been republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nVANCOUVER, Canada\u2014Vegetables are becoming increasingly common in an unusual place: the grocery store meat aisle.\nSales of alternative, or plant-based, meats are booming worldwide. Driven by skyrocketing demand from consumers striving to cut back on meat and companies facing increasing pressure to reduce their environmental footprint, the market is anticipated to reach $23.1 billion by 2025.\nAnd major meat companies have been racing to meet demand, with big players such as McDonald's and Maple Leaf Foods recently launching a suite of plant-based meats.\nMeat contributes up to 8 billion tons of CO2 per year, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of 1.6 billion cars, and according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global shift to diets that contain less meat is essential to keep global warming under the 1.5 degree Celsius limit agreed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\"It's well known that eating lower down the food chain is more environmentally efficient,\" said Navin Ramankutty, professor of global environmental change and food security at the University of British Columbia.\nThat's because plants require far fewer resources\u2014water, land, fossil fuels\u2014to produce, per calorie, than meat. It's also healthier, the IPCC report notes; excessive meat consumption is linked to numerous health issues.\nThose factors have fueled a booming market in alternative proteins\u2014meat- and dairylike products that are usually manufactured from soy or pea protein\u2014with about 10 percent of Canadians saying they eat little or no meat, according to research by Dalhousie University's Agri-Food Analytics Lab.\nCompanies in their infancy a decade ago, such as Beyond Meat, have become household names. Now, major meat companies have jumped in the fray.\nFor instance, in the past three years, Maple Leaf Foods has purchased two venerable alternative meat companies\u2014Lightlife Foods and the Field Roast Grain Meat Co.\u2014and announced plans to build a $401-million pea protein processing plant in the U.S.\nThis year, the company launched a line of products made from a blend of plant and animal proteins, a \"direct response to Canadians' desire to eat sustainably,\" said Michael McCain, Maple Leaf Foods' CEO, in a written statement.\nMaple Leaf Foods isn't alone in banking on sustained consumer interest in plant-based meats.\nIn the first half of 2020 alone, more than $1.4 billion was invested in alternative protein companies. That's more than twice the total amount spent last year, according to Coller Capital, an international private equity investment company. The organization regularly publishes an index evaluating social, environmental, and governance risk factors for 60 major meat and protein companies as a guide for sustainability-minded investors.\nThe #FAIRRIndex is the only comprehensive assessment of the largest global animal protein companies on critical #environmental, #social and #governance issues. Explore the data to identify the #industryleaders who play a role in addressing #climatechange https:\/\/t.co\/mzM4iagx7C pic.twitter.com\/SVCMNOda17\n\u2014 FAIRR Initiative (@FAIRRInitiative) November 20, 2020\nFor Sylvain Charlebois, director of Dalhousie University's Agri-Food Analytics Lab, those numbers aren't surprising.\nPlant-based meats remain a small part of major meat companies' total production.\n\"I don't think (consumer demand) is going to go away. \u2026 COVID may have stalled the momentum a little bit, but I am expecting the momentum to come back,\" he said, citing Canadians' concerns about the environment, their health, and the ethical treatment of farm animals.\nEven veganism, one of the more challenging plant-centric diets to follow, is on the rise, he noted, with about 600,000 Canadians saying they were vegans this year compared with 400,000 in 2019.\nStill, some researchers say that, despite the hype, plant-based meats might be less sustainable than they appear, especially when it comes to evaluating industrially produced, plant-based proteins. Simply measuring the number of resources used to produce plant protein and comparing that against the number used to produce an equivalent volume of animal protein doesn't give an accurate picture of the food's overall impact, Abergel said.\nPlant-based meats remain a small part of major meat companies' total production, she said. That makes it difficult for plant-based meats to significantly improve these companies' environmental footprint without additional, supply-chain-wide changes to how"}
{"text":" they produce and distribute food.\nFor instance, only 4 percent of Maple Leaf Foods' sales revenue last year\u2014about $176 million\u2014came from plant-based products. However, the company has invested in a suite of initiatives to reduce its overall environmental footprint by 50 percent (compared with 2014) by 2025.\nAbergel said an environmentally conscientious consumer should also consider how the base ingredients for plant-based meats are produced.\n\"Certain companies use soy. Other companies use pea protein. In [both cases], are these grown organically or are they grown in monocultures? Are they part of the same supply chain \u2026 used for feeding cattle?\" she said. \"If the soy protein or the pea protein come from monocultures, and the soy is genetically modified, I think that sustainability measures have to take these into account.\"\nIndustrial agriculture is associated with myriad environmental impacts, from nitrous oxide emissions tied to excessive fertilizer use to hurting pollinators through habitat destruction.\nNot only that, the economic model that underpins both industrial agriculture and meat production is dominated by a handful of large processing and retail companies. As a result, farmers often have little choice but to sell their crops at unsustainably low prices that aren't reflected in the prices paid by consumers, according to Cathy Holtslander, director of research and policy at the National Farmers Union.\nFarm debt has risen exponentially in the past 20 years, more than doubling since 2000 to reach $115 billion this year. Meanwhile, Canadian farmers' net incomes have steadily dropped, hovering around $10 billion annually since the mid-1980s, rates unseen since the Great Depression.\nMore on Climate Desk\nShould Oil and Gas Be Treated Like Nuclear Weapons?\nHow Oregon's Armed Standoffs Made Their Way to D.C.\nMost \"Renewable Cities\" Aren't As Clean As They Claim to Be\nWhy Do Republicans Keep Posting Photos of Disgusting-Looking Food?\nThat has pushed many out of business\u2014the number of farms in Canada dropped 25 per cent between 1991 and 2011\u2014and has made it more difficult for those who remain to innovate with more sustainable farming techniques, such as cover cropping to absorb excess nitrogen or interspersing pollinator habitats in their fields.\nAbergel also pointed out that many large food processors have also seen other concerns in their supply chains, everything from working conditions to food safety. Those challenges speak to the need for a definition of food sustainability that is broader than just an environmental footprint, she said: \"If you're somebody who is really concerned about sustainability, you need to go deeper.\"\nClimate Change Food Farming Climate Desk"}

The orbital degree of freedom often underpins complex physical properties and a variety of extraordinary phenomena while coupling with charge, spin and lattice. In this thesis, we demonstrate a fascinating example of orbital-related physical properties in Mn-based spinels. The strong octahedral preference of Jahn-Teller ions Mn3+ results in simultaneous chemical and structural phase separation into Mn-poor (cubic) and Mn-rich (tetragonal) regions, forming two types of rectangular nanorods with cross section checkerboard-like (CB). Because of the pioneering discovery of checkerboards in the nonmagnetic ZnMnxGa1-xO4, we chose to study two magnetic spinel systems: (1) Mg(MnxFe1-x)O4, where unfortunately only poorly-ordered magnetic nano CBs were observed; and (2) Mn-doped CoFe2O4, the nano CBs with distinct magnetic properties and tunable sizes achieved here are highly ordered, exhibiting a nearly ideal architecture for the patterned perpendicular recording medium. The evolution of such compositional separation and topological nanoscale ordering is reasonably understood based on a three dimensional (3D) phase-field microelasticity (PFM) model.\nAdvisors\/Committee Members: Zhang, Chenglin, 1977- (author), Cheong, Sang-Wook (chair), Leath, Paul (internal member), Williams, Theodore (internal member), Chandra, Premala (internal member), Zhou, Tao (outside member).\nSubjects\/Keywords: Manganese; Spinel group\nZhang, Chenglin, 1.

They are also being intensively pursued for electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Commercial lithium ion cells are currently made largely with the layered LiCoO\u2082 cathode. However, only 50% of the theoretical capacity of LiCoO\u2082 can be utilized in practical cells due to the chemical and structural instabilities at deep charge as well as safety concerns. These drawbacks together with the high cost and toxicity of Co have created enormous interest in alternative cathodes. In this regard, spinel LiMn\u2082O\u2084 has been investigated widely as Mn is inexpensive and environmentally benign. However, LiMn\u2082O\u2084 exhibits severe capacity fade on cycling, particularly at elevated temperatures. With an aim to overcome the capacity fading problems, several cationic substitutions to give LiMn[subscript 2-y]M[subscript y]O\u2084 (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) have been pursued in the literature. Among the cation-substituted systems, LiMn[subscript 1.5]Ni[subscript 0.5]O\u2084 has become attractive as it shows a high capacity of ~ 130 mAh\/g (theoretical capacity: 147 mAh\/g) at around 4.7 V. With an aim to improve the electrochemical performance of the 5 V LiMn[subscript 1.5]Ni[subscript 0.5]O\u2084 spinel oxide, various cation-substituted LiMn[subscript 1.5-y]Ni[subscript 0.5-z]M[subscript y+z]O\u2084 (M = Li, Mg, Fe, Co, and Zn) spinel oxides have been investigated by chemical lithium extraction. The cation-substituted LiMn[subscript 1.5-y]Ni[subscript 0.5-z]M[subscript y+z]O\u2084 spinel oxides exhibit better cyclability and rate capability in the 5 V region compared to the unsubstituted LiMn[subscript 1.5]Ni[subscript 0.5]O\u2084 cathodes although the degree of manganese dissolution does not vary significantly. The better electrochemical properties of LiMn[subscript 1.5-y]Ni]subscript 0.5-z]M[subscript y+z]O\u2084 are found to be due to a smaller lattice parameter difference among the three cubic phases formed during the chargedischarge process. In addition, while the spinel Li[subscript 1-x]Mn[subscript 1.58]Ni[subscript 0.42]O\u2084 was chemically stable, the spinel Li[subscript 1-x]Co\u2082O\u2084 was found to exhibit both proton insertion and oxygen loss at deep lithium extraction due to the chemical instability arising from a overlap of the Co[superscript 3+\/4+]:3d band on the top of the O[superscript 2-]:2p band.

The lithium content in the transition metal layer is, however, sensitively influenced by the tendency of Ni[superscript 3+] to get reduced to Ni[superscript 2+] and the consequent volatilization of lithium during synthesis. Moreover, high Mn4+ content causes a decrease in oxygen mobility and loss.

The discovery of composite zircon-baddeleyite grains and chromite in the Basal Rhyolite demands a reassessment of proposed scenarios for its petrogenesis. These scenarios include: 1) crustal melting caused by, and differentiation of, intrusive ultramafic magmas of the 9 km thick Rustenberg Layered Suite and 2) crustal melting initiated by an impact of one or more bolides. Although evidence for shock metamorphism, key to verifying an impact origin, has not been found, it has been proposed that unique quench textures in the Basal Rhyolite formed during quenching from impact-induced superheat (T > 1686\u00b0 C). The presence of coexisting zircon (ZrSiO4) and baddeleyite (ZrO2) has been documented in several impact structures as a result of the reversible reaction: ZrSiO4 = ZrO2 + SiO2 at ~1686\u00b0C. Therefore, the presence of zircon and baddeleyite in the Basal Rhyolite provides a test for an impact origin of the Basal Rhyolite. Electron microprobe and transmission electron microscope studies highlight several characteristics of the baddeleyite that are inconsistent with their formation by impact processes.

{"text":" chromites in the Basal Rhyolite also suggest that they once existed in the interstices to olivine or pyroxene in a mafic cumulate prior to entrainment. Since no cumulates are known to exist underneath the Bushveld Complex, the parent lithology of the chromite and baddeleyite is likely a mafic magma associated with the Rustenberg Layered Suite. Chemical similarities between chromites from this study and chromites of a baddeleyite-bearing chill sequence to the Bushveld Complex provide the grounds for future comparative studies of these minerals. At this point, endogenous processes more readily explain the presence and characteristics of composite zircon-baddeleyite grains and chromite. Their presence in the Basal Rhyolite suggests that a dynamic magmatic setting existed during the early stages of Rooiberg Group extrusion.

Two principal lobes range from dunite at their base through olivine clinopyroxenite to gabbro. On the basis of crystallisation sequence, mineral composition and melt inclusion compositions (Spandler et al., 2000), the intrusion appears to have formed from primitive hydrous basaltic magmas in feeder chambers beneath an island arc volcanic complex as part of the Permian Brook Street Terrane. Dunite of the south lobe is well exposed in the Greenhills Quarry. The dominant primary mineral is cumulus olivine with minor cumulus chromian spinel, intercumulus clinopyroxene and rare orthopyroxene and plagioclase. A series of dykes of varying composition cross cut the dunite, forming small zones of plagioclase-rich rocks. A number of zircon grains extracted from a plagioclase-rich felsic dike intruding the dunite of the Greenhills complex have been dated using LA-ICP-MS analysis of U\/Pb isotope ratios to an age of 261.5 \u00b1 2.3 Ma. This is consistent with the minimum age of 246 \u00b1 10 Ma obtained from K\/Ar dating of hornblende in gabbroic rock by Aronson (1968) and the age reported by Spandler et al. (2003) of 265 Ma obtained by Kimbrough et al. (1992) using U\/Pb isotope ratios. Spandler et al. (2000) report the occurrence of platinum-group minerals (PGM) in chromian spinel at one location just south of the Greenhills dunite quarry.

{"text":" nine alteration rims of the dunite and one white vein has identified calcite, chlorite, chrysotile and other rarer phyllosilicates. L.O.I. analysis reveals the average volatile component of the dunite to be 7.74 wt% while bulk rock volatile element (CNS) analysis reveals the average concentration of naturally occurring carbonates in the dunite to be 0.6 wt% per sample with some samples having as much as 4.5 wt% carbonate and up to 11.5 wt% H2O. Recent studies have shown that natural rates of carbonation of olivine-rich peridotite (Keleman & Matter, 2008) and serpentinite mine tailings (Wilson et al., 2009) are much faster than previously thought. These rates should be further enhanced in the subsurface because the carbonation reactions are exothermic and, in the case of serpentine-bearing rock, lead to increased porosity. If the dunite has sufficient fracture permeability at depth, it is conceivable that CO2 could be injected at a flow rate sufficient for heating due to carbonation to balance cooling due to advection and diffusion in order to maintain an optimal temperature for rapid reaction. Alternatively the natural rates of carbonation of olivine at the surface can be enhanced by simply crushing and spreading on the Earth's surface (Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006).

Each installation will range in size from about 2 megawatts to 10 megawatts, and they'll total 100 megawatts of capacity.\nThe systems won't tie up capacity or rack up fees on long-distance transmission lines. Instead, they'll be built at or near existing local distribution stations where demand is forecast to rise.\n\"We think the costs are going to be competitive without considering any bells and whistles,\" Engelking said.\nBy \"bells and whistles,\" she was referring to solar or renewable energy credits that utilities use for meeting state requirements. Geronimo filed its proposal a month and a half before the Minnesota Legislature passed the 1.5 percent solar standard.\nSolar advocates are convinced, though, that the economics for peaking power are tilting in their favor.\nJohn Farrell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and a leading expert on distributed generation, said he's skeptical about Xcel Energy's assumptions, including its forecasts for natural gas prices.\n\"I think they are operating mostly on inertia here with their approach to meeting their peaking needs,\" Farrell said. \"It seems relatively ridiculous that there's so little attention being paid to solar compared to how willing they are to just step up and build another natural gas plant.\"\nRead the full story here.\nFollow ILSR:\nILSR\nWe welcome you to stay on top of what ILSR is up to by subscribing to one or more of our newsletters.\nLatest posts from ILSR\nILSR's 2018 Annual Report: Building Local Power - November 29, 2018\nCome Work With Us!

{"text":"Heat integration of combined 1st and 2nd generation ethanol production from wheat kernels and wheat straw\nElisabeth Joelsson1,\nMats Galbe1 &\nOla Wallberg1\nReducing the energy used in an ethanol plant is an important step towards reducing both the cost and environmental impact of the process. Pinch technology was used to analyze the energy utilization and to investigate possible energy savings in stand-alone and combined 1st and 2nd generation ethanol production plant designs. Different heat sources and sinks in the plant were identified to improve energy integration. Four different scenarios were evaluated using Aspen Plus, with heat exchanger networks generated in the simulation program Aspen Energy Analyzer. The total direct cost of the heat exchanger networks was calculated using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer.\nIt was shown that heating costs could be reduced by 40-47% and cooling costs by 42-54% by heat integration. The sum of the discounted total direct cost for heat exchangers and annual cost of utilities was also lower in the heat integrated cases than in the corresponding non-heat integrated cases for all the configurations investigated.\nHeat integration showed that the heating and cooling energy demands could be reduced to a great extent in stand-alone as well as combined 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol plants. The cost for heating and cooling of the process can be decreased with heat integration. The main cost for providing the processes with heat can be attributed to the cost of hot utilities.\nEnergy is required to secure and improve the production of many necessary commodities as well as to cover essential human needs, such as food and heating. The increasing global energy demand, combined with the effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, which causes global warming, have accentuated the need to find sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources. In the search for energy sources that can complement and replace fossil fuels it is important to look for alternatives that can meet these requirements. During the past decade, fossil fuels, which release high amounts of GHGs when burned, accounted for about 85% of the primary energy use in the World [1].\nIt has been estimated that in the USA, 28% of all GHG emission results from the transport sector, while industry accounts for around 20%, primarily originating from the use of fossil fuels [2]. The corresponding values for the EU are about 25% and 20%. Compared to the level in 1990, which was defined as the starting point for the EU's goal to decrease GHG emissions by 20% by 2020 [3], measurements made in 2007 showed that GHG emission resulting from transportation had increased by about 36%, while emissions from other sectors were generally decreasing. EU legislation has therefore required a further reduction of GHG emissions from vehicle fuels by up to 10% by 2020 as described in the amendment to the Fuel Quality Directive [4], which is closely related to the Renewable Energy Directive that is promoting 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector by 2020 [5]. Biofuels are seen as an important means of achieving the GHG emission target for the transport sector. The EU has also stated that it is imperative that fuels be produced in a sustainable way, in order to reduce the impact on the environment.\nBioethanol referred to as 1st generation (1G) ethanol is produced from food-grade material that often contains easily accessible sugars, such as sucrose from sugarcane, or starch from corn or wheat kernels. In order not to compete with food production, biofuels can be made from lignocellulosic residues such as agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic feedstock. Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic material is often referred to as 2nd generation (2G) bioethanol, and in this case, the fermentable sugars are extracted from cellulose-containing materials. To date, only one commercial-scale facility is producing bioethanol from cellulose via the biochemical route. The plant, which is located in Crescentino, Italy, was constructed by Beta Renewables, and was opened at the beginning of October 2013 [6],[7]. Some other commercial-scale facilities that are currently under construction, or planned for the near future are: the DuPont Biofuels Solutions' plant in NV, USA utilizing corn stover [8], Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels' plant in Emmetsburg, IA, USA using corn cobs [9], Abengoa Bioenergy's plant in Hugoton, KS, USA using unspecified biomass [10], Project Alpha by Beta Renewables in Clinton, NC, USA using energy grass [11], Canergy's plant in The Imperial Valley of California, USA utilizing energy cane and straw [12], and the Iogen Corporation plant in s'o Paulo, Brazil using bagasse and straw [13]. To facilitate the introduction of and transition to 2G bioethanol, various strategies for the integration of 1G and 2G ethanol plants can be considered. Integration can help to reduce the cost of downstream processing in"}
{"text":" the 2G plant while the technology matures, and at the same time provide primary energy to the 1G plant. Wheat is an abundant crop in Europe today, which generates a large amount of straw. Bioethanol production from wheat kernels and wheat straw is thus of considerable interest.\nSince the bioethanol production is considered as an energy demanding process it is important to keep track of the energy requirement in the plant. The energy utilization can be investigated using pinch analysis technology. Pinch technology was introduced by Linnhoff and Flower in 1978 [14], and is based on identifying heat sources and sinks in a process. These can then be used to provide the process with heating and cooling through the use of heat exchangers, reducing the need for external energy input. The cost of installing heat exchangers can then be compared to the cost of utilities in the form of external heating and cooling by steam and cooling water. Implementing pinch technology during process design can reduce investment costs during retrofitting [15].\nA number of previous studies utilizing pinch technology have focused on improving the 1G bioethanol process to decrease the energy demand in the plant and to increase the surplus and use of residual material, excluding it from being incinerated. Dias et al. [16] investigated different methods of improving the process, such as increasing the degree of process integration in a sugar cane plant to reduce steam consumption, and thereby increase the amount of available lignocellulosic material. They also compared low- and high-pressure boiler systems to investigate a potential increase in electricity production. Their study showed that it was possible to increase the available amount of lignocellulosic material with increased process integration, which then can be used for bioethanol production in a 2G plant, or burned to generate electricity. It was also shown that a higher boiler pressure increased the electricity production but decreased the surplus of lignocellulosic material. The use of combined heat and power (CHP) generation, together with thermal integration of distillation or evaporation is often investigated during pinch analysis of a bioethanol plant, not only because distillation and evaporation are two of the most energy-demanding steps in the process, but also because optimizing the CHP process will result in overall better energy utilization. Morandin et al. [17] investigated a sugarcane-converting process with different configurations of a multi-effect evaporator and the option to integrate the process with a CHP plant fuelled by bagasse. By altering the design parameters for the evaporator they found that the hot utility demand could be reduced by one third, and that using bagasse to fuel the CHP plant could cover the energy demand for a base case scenario. Dias et al. [18] also demonstrated the benefits of incorporating distillation into the thermal analysis as this leads to a lower global heating demand for the production plant. Heat integration of the distillation and evaporation stages, at different pressure levels, has earlier also been modeled by e. g. Wingren et al. [19] and Sassner et al. [20] for the 2G ethanol plant leading to a decreased use of primary steam in the process. Pfeffer et al. [21] applied pinch analysis to a 1G bioethanol and a dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) plant utilizing wheat by generating a heat exchanger network, and found that heat integration of the beer column and the rectification column resulted in the highest primary heat reduction. The inclusion of a gas boiler or a gas engine in a CHP system was also simulated. Biogas was then produced instead of DDGS and used to replace external fuel. Franceschin et al. [22] used pinch analysis to optimize the energy and water demand in a dry-mill bioethanol corn plant. The results indicated that the water requirement could be reduced by implementing heat exchangers. \u010cu\u010dek et al. [23] employed pinch analysis to evaluate two different paths for syngas conversion of corn stover to bioethanol. The thermo-biochemical (syngas fermentation) and thermo-chemical (catalytic mixed-alcohol synthesis) processes were compared, and the latter showed better potential for heat integration, and therefore were preferred when investigating integration of 1G and 2G bioethanol plants using corn and corn stover.\nSome pinch analysis studies have also been performed on 2G stand-alone plants. Modarresi et al. [24] performed pinch and exergy analysis for a 2G wheat straw bioethanol plant with the aim of reducing the energy required for heating and cooling by implementing a heat exchanger network. In a another study, Kravanja et al. [25] investigated a distillation system containing two stripper columns and a multi-effect evaporator for a bioethanol process fermenting hexoses and pentoses from wheat straw. They found that one of the stripper columns and one evap"}

[26] calculated the theoretical energy savings for a 2G bioethanol plant utilizing rye straw with co-production of xylitol and found it to be 68%. However, theoretical energy savings usually differ from the savings that are possible in a heat exchanger network in a real process. Two different studies investigating heat integration in bioethanol production from wood were performed by Piccolo and Bezzo [27] and Fujimoto et al. [28]. Piccolo and Bezzo [27] analyzed two different process alternatives (i.e. enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation and gasification and fermentation) for production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic material and Fujimoto et al. [28] studied heat released in the process at low temperature. Fujimoto et al. [28] found that energy utilization was improved by introducing a mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) in the process. The MVR was used to increase the pressure of the overhead vapor from evaporation, which could be used later as a source of heat for distillation and drying. The use of MVR in the evaporation step for a 2G plant has also been studied by Sassner et al. [20].\nIn the present study, pinch analysis was applied to evaluate various cases consisting of 1G and 2G stand-alone plants, co-located 1G and 2G plants and a combined 1G and 2G plant in which material streams are mixed prior to distillation. The study was performed to investigate the effect of employing heat exchanger networks in full-scale plants. The simulation program Aspen Energy Analyzer was used to create heat exchanger networks from process models generated in the flowsheeting program Aspen Plus. The total direct cost of the heat exchanger networks was subsequently estimated using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer and compared to the cost of utilities.\nThe composite curves that were obtained from the pinch analysis for the four different base cases, using a global minimum \u0394T of 10\u00b0C, are shown in Figures'1, 2, 3 and 4. Preheating of the incoming wheat and straw material, which had a high solids content, was performed with steam or condensate. Steam-pretreated material was cooled with condensate or cooling utility. In some case, for example, for condensing steam, a lower value of \u0394T could be used since the heat transfer coefficients of condensing steam are higher than for liquids. This can result in a lower usage of heating and cooling in the heat integrated cases compared with the minimum heating and cooling target that can be subtracted from the composite curves in Figures'1, 2, 3 and 4.\nHot and cold composite curves for the 1G ethanol plant. Resulting in a minimum heating and cooling target of 39 MW and 25 MW, respectively.\nHot and cold composite curves for the co-located 1G and 2G ethanol plants. Resulting in a minimum heating and cooling target of 59 MW and 43 MW, respectively.\nHot and cold composite curves for the combined 1G and 2G ethanol plant. Resulting in a minimum heating and cooling target of 51 MW and 45 MW, respectively.\nThe hot and cold pinch temperatures appeared at 113\u00b0C and 103\u00b0C, respectively, for the 1G stand-alone plant and the co-located plants. For the 2G stand-alone plant the hot pinch appeared at 95\u00b0C and the cold pinch at 85\u00b0C. For the combined case the corresponding values were 93\u00b0C and 83\u00b0C. The approximate total heat transfer area and number of heat exchangers for the different non-heat integrated and heat integrated cases are also presented in Table 1. It shows that the total heat transfer area and numbers of heat exchangers in all cases are lower for the non-heat integrated cases. The large difference in heat exchanger area in the non-heat integrated and heat integrated cases can be explained by the larger \u0394T that will originate when utility streams are utilized for heat transfer instead of process streams. A larger \u0394T will result in a lower heat transfer area. In the table it can also be seen that it is a small difference in the number of heat exchangers between the non-integrated and integrated case. This can occur since all streams will need to be heat exchanged at least once, both in the non-heat integrated and the heat integrated cases. A restriction was also set on the maximum amount of stream splitting that was allowed to be made.\nTable 1 Total heat transfer area and number of heat exchangers in the non-heat integrated and heat integrated cases\nThe heating and the cooling demands for the four base cases, each case evaluated with and without heat integration, are presented in Table 2. Heat sources and sinks in the plants were covered either solely by utilities or both utilities and heat integration, by heat exchange. For"}
{"text":" the 1G integrated case it can be seen that the heating and cooling demands will be less than the minimum heating and cooling demands presented in Figure 1. This results from that a lower \u0394T than the global \u0394T minimum sometimes can be utilized in a single heat exchanger, potentially leading to a lower overall heating or cooling demand. In this case, the reboiler of the stripper, for example, was heat exchanged with the overhead vapor from the rectifier, which resulted in a lower \u0394T than the global \u0394T. This was assumed possible since the heat transfer coefficient for the condensing steam is higher than for a liquid and consequently a lower \u0394T can be appointed over the heat exchanger. Table 2 also shows the energy required to produce one kg of ethanol in each case. An electricity consumption of 0.84 MJ\/kg ethanol was also added to each case when calculating the energy demand per kg ethanol, as this value corresponds to the average electricity demand in a 1G corn ethanol plant [29].\nTable 2 Heating and cooling demands for the four ethanol plant investigated, with and without heat integration\nThe potential energy savings that can be made according to the pinch analysis for the various cases studied are presented in Figure 5. The whole bars (100%) in Figure 5 represent the hot and cold utility requirements for the non-heat integrated plants. The top parts of the bars represent the savings in heating and cooling, which could be obtained by implementing heat integration, compared with the plants without heat integration, and the bottom parts the energy utilized.\nPercentage of energy usage and potential savings for hot and cold utilities. Comparing heat integrated cases with non-heat integrated cases.\nThe results shown in Figure 5 indicate that savings of between 40 and 47% could be made in heating, and between 42 and 54% in cooling, depending on the plant configuration, by implementing heat integration. This illustrates the considerable potential for major energy savings when designing new 2G or combined 1G and 2G ethanol plants. Considerable heat exchange is already being employed in 1G plants, but further improvements may be possible. As the various cases represent different raw materials, loadings and plant configurations, the results should primarily be regarded in relation to each individual base case. Also as there are several ways of constructing an energy-efficient heat exchanger network, depending on the boundary conditions, these results are only some of a number of possible solutions. The optimal solution will depend on the kind of process in question, the desired end products, and the feasibility of the modeled network, however some conclusions can be drawn.\nIt can be seen from Table 2 that the energy demand of the combined plant (88 MW) is lower than that of the co-located plants (108 MW) using the same raw material loading, and thus producing the same amount of ethanol. When heat integration is implemented the combined case requires 53 MW heat, while the co-located plants use 63 MW. The combined cases thus requires 16-19% less energy than the co-located cases. The improvement could be partly explained by the process design. For example, no dryer is needed in the combined cases since no DDGS are produced. Moreover, only one evaporation and one distillation unit are needed in the combined cases since the 1G and 2G streams are combined prior to distillation. When no DDGS are produced all the residual material after filtration and evaporation is incinerated together with the biogas produced to supply the plant with heat. Any excess heat produced during the incineration, assuming the demand of the plant is met, will be used to generate electricity that can be sold. This can be seen in Table 3 where the combined plant with heat integration will produce 31 MW of electricity, which can be compared with the co-located plants that produce 17 MW of electricity. Depending on the market for DDGS and electricity, the co-located heat integrated plants or the combined heat integrated plant is more likely to be feasible. In Table 2 it can also be seen that the combined plant with heat integration (53 MW) requires only 49% of the energy used by the co-located plants without heat integration (108 MW).\nTable 3 Energy inflow of raw materials and surplus heat and energy outflow of products including the mass flow of DDGS\nThe results obtained for the 2G stand-alone ethanol plant indicate that the savings in the energy required for heating by utilizing an optimized heat exchanger network could be up to 47%, without any other changes in the process. Kravanja et al. [25] have studied how design modification of the distillation and evaporation stages and integration with the background process could affect the energy demand, indicating that it could be decreased even further.\nTable 2 also gives the energy required to produce one kg of ethanol in each case. The calculations are based on the energy utilization (including external electricity) of each plant and the corresponding ethanol production, which varied depending on the raw material loading. The highest heating energy demand was"}
{"text":" found for the 2G stand-alone plant, and the lowest for the 1G stand-alone plant, both with and without heat integration. The 2G plant without heat integration used 42 MJ\/kg ethanol, while the case with heat integration required only 23 MJ\/kg ethanol. The corresponding values for the 1G plant were 25 MJ\/kg ethanol and 15 MJ\/kg ethanol. The results obtained for the 2G plant are in line with the savings found in a previous study of a similar 2G ethanol plant by Modarresi et al. [24], who obtained values of about 32 MJ\/kg ethanol for a plant without heat integration and 19 MJ\/kg ethanol for one with heat integration. The presented results for the 1G plant can be compared with results found in the literature for a 1G corn ethanol plant utilizing approximately 27 MJ\/kg ethanol in a non-optimized and 14 MJ\/kg in a more efficient plant configuration [29]. Pfeffer et al. [21] also calculated that with a \u0394T of 20\u00b0C a feasible wheat bioethanol plant producing DDGS would utilize around 20 MJ\/kg ethanol, excluding electricity.\nA lower heat demand per kg ethanol was required in the heat integrated cases by both the co-located plants (19 MJ\/kg ethanol) and the combined plant (17 MJ\/kg ethanol), than by the 2G stand-alone plant with heat integration (23 MJ\/kg ethanol). Comparison of the 1G stand-alone plant and the combined plant reveals that the values are similar, namely 17 MJ\/kg ethanol and 15 MJ\/kg ethanol, respectively.\nThe main heating energy requirements in the base cases are those for the distillation- and evaporation stages, the preheating of the distillation- and evaporation feed and the dryer. The distillation units use between 28% (the 2G stand-alone plant) and 43% (the 1G stand-alone plant) of the total energy required by the base cases, without heat integration. Depending on the pressure in the distillation columns, and the size of the feed flow, the energy required to preheat the feed to the distillation stage will vary between 11%, for the 1G stand-alone plant, and 28%, for the 2G stand-alone plant. In the 1G plant the feed is heated to a lower temperature than in the 2G plant since the pressure in the columns is operated from low to high pressure so as to avoid gluten deposits, while the columns in the 2G plant are operated from high to low pressure. The evaporation units consume between 11 and 19% of the total energy usage for the various cases without heat integration, where the 1G plant requires the lowest, and the combined plant and the 2G stand-alone plant the highest, since the stillage is more diluted in these cases. Preheating the feed prior to evaporation in the non-heat integrated cases would require between 7 and 14% of the total energy used by the different plants. The 2G stand-alone plant and the combined plant requires a high energy input to preheat the evaporation feed, due to the expected low ethanol concentration in the distillation feed, resulting in a large stillage stream. Finally, the dryer utilized 10-17% of the total energy requirement in the 1G stand-alone and the co-located cases without heat integration.\nPinch analysis showed that the energy required for distillation could be reduced by 38-60%, depending on the case, when implementing heat integration. The lowest reduction, 38%, was found for the 1G stand-alone plant. This is mainly the result of the high temperature in the rectifying reboiler (143\u00b0C) preventing the transfer of heat from other streams in the process to the reboiler because of the lower temperatures in the rest of the process. The highest energy reduction in distillation, 60%, was found for the 2G stand-alone plant. Part of the energy demand was covered by utilizing condensing steam from the pretreatment step. The corresponding values for the co-located plant with heat integration and the combined plant with heat integration were 52% and 42%, respectively. The energy required to heat the distillation feed in the combined heat integrated plant was almost zero, and for the other cases the reductions were 64-81%. These reductions were partly the result of heat exchange between the stillage streams and the feed streams. The energy required to heat the feed stream to the evaporation unit was also greatly reduced for the 1G and 2G stand-alone plants with heat integration, being 82% and 90%, respectively. For the combined plant the reduction was only 8% after heat integration, and for the co-located plant it was about 30%. No heat reduction was observed in the evaporation stage. The reason for this was mainly the high temperature of 129\u00b0C in the first effect, which limited the amount of available streams that could transfer energy to the"}
{"text":" evaporator stage. The condensing streams that could have been used for heat exchange in these cases were primarily chosen to supply the distillation stage with energy. Therefore, utilities had to be supplied to the evaporation stage. For the high-temperature condensing streams the primary options for heat exchange are in distillation, evaporation and in the dryer (but also, to some degree, the feed streams) since these steps are operated at the highest temperatures. Therefore, it is important to investigate the complete process to obtain a good overview of all the heat sources and heat sinks in the system. A large amount of energy must be dissipated at low temperature because of the low pressure in the last evaporation step, where the overhead vapor has a temperature of 63\u00b0C. This energy could partly be recovered with MVR, as investigated by Fujimoto et al. [28] and Sassner et al. [20]. Part of the steam could possibly also be used to replace some of the live steam in the liquefaction step.\nTable 3 presents the energy inflow and the power and DDGS produced in the various cases investigated. The raw material loadings are presented as the heat of combustion of the raw material based on the lower heating values. Natural gas (methane) added in the table represents extra heat energy input needed to fuel the plants when residual material was not enough or non-existent to supply the plants with heat. Electricity listed in the table under energy inputs represents the assumed electricity requirement of 0.84 MJ\/kg ethanol, corresponding to an average electricity demand in a 1G ethanol corn plant. Because of these assumptions the electricity listed in Table 3 is not subtracted from the electricity listed under products, which is representing the total electricity generated in the various cases. Biogas and electricity were produced in all cases except the 1G plant, where DDGS were the only co-product. The biogas produced was primarily utilized to cover the energy demand in the plants, however, in some of the cases a surplus of biogas was generated; therefore, both the total produced biogas and the surplus biogas, not utilized in the plant, are included in the table.\nWith the plant capacities assumed in this study, only the 2G stand-alone plant and the combined plant are self-supporting in heating energy for the process, by burning residual material. This applies to the cases with and without heat integration. In all the other cases, natural gas (methane) had to be added to cover the energy demand of the process. Natural gas was used as the only energy source for the 1G plant since the DDGS produced was intended to be sold, and there was therefore no residual material that could be incinerated to supply the plant with heat. This shows that with the plant capacity chosen for the 2G plant the residual material produced in the 2G process is not sufficient to supply both the 1G and 2G stand-alone processes with heat. However, the use of external energy can be reduced to about one third in the 1G plant while still supplying the 2G plant with all the heat required. It should also be kept in mind that the 1G plant can be fueled with residual straw or other biomass instead of natural gas. Figure 6 shows the energy efficiency of the products (including DDGS) in relation to the energy input. The lower heating values (LHV): 50 MJ\/kg for methane, 27.1 MJ\/kg for ethanol, 17.1 MJ\/kg for wheat straw, and 16.3 MJ\/kg for wheat kernels were used. An average lower heating value of 18.7 MJ\/kg dry matter was used for the DDGS [30],[31]. Energy input included the raw material, supplemented methane and an average electricity requirement of 0.84 MJ\/kg ethanol. The energy efficiency for the DDGS is included in Figure 6 to show the total energy output of the co-products. However, the DDGS were not considered for incineration in these cases, and their energy efficiency is, therefore, not further discussed.\nEnergy efficiency on LHV basis for ethanol, electricity, biogas and DDGS related to energy inflow. The energy inflow includes raw material, electricity and natural gas for the various cases investigated.\nIn all cases where natural gas must be added the energy efficiency will decrease. The results show that the combined plant had a higher energy efficiency for ethanol and electricity than the co-located plants at the same raw material loading, both with and without heat integration. However, DDGS is also produced in the co-located plants, and the market price of these should also be considered.\nTable 4 presents the total annual cost of utilities (steam and cooling water) in million EUR (MEUR) for the different cases. Direct steam used for steam explosion and liquefaction is also included. The total direct cost of heat exchangers, calculated with APEA, and given in the table, includes an annuity"}
{"text":" of 0.11, corresponding to 7% internal rate, and an economic lifetime of 15 years.\nTable 4 Cost of utilities and the total direct cost of heat exchangers per annum\nThe results presented in Table 4 show that the cost of heat exchangers is higher for the heat integrated cases than in the non-heat integrated cases, however the cost of utilities is lower. Figure 7 shows the annual total cost of hot and cold utilities and heat exchangers for each case.\nSum of the discounted total direct cost for heat exchangers and annual cost of utilities (MEUR: EUR millions).\nIt can be seen that the total cost is lower in all cases with heat integration than in the corresponding cases without heat integration. The cases with heat integration are 28-37% less expensive than the cases without heat integration, depending on the case. The cost of utilities is the main cost item, and corresponds to 75-90% of the total cost for the heat integrated and non-heat integrated cases, depending on the case. About 90% of the cost of utilities is for heating. In the cases including heat integration, the total cost of utilities and total direct costs for heat exchangers will be between 13 and 23 million EUR per year.\nA sensitivity analysis was also carried out to investigate the annual total cost of utility and discounted total direct cost of heat exchangers when the cost of the hot utility was decreased, compared to the base case, assuming a base case steam cost of 20 EUR\/ton for 4- and 6-bar steam and 25 EUR\/ton for 20-bar steam. The result of the sensitivity analysis is presented in Figure 8.\nDecreased steam cost. The annual total cost of utilities and discounted total direct cost for heat exchangers when the cost of steam was decreased compared with the base case prices.\nFigure 8 shows that the price of steam must be reduced to less than about 25% of the original price to make the non-heat integrated cases less costly than those heat integrated.\nPinch analysis was applied to a selection of cases: a 1G stand-alone plant, a 2G stand-alone plant, co-located 1G and 2G stand-alone plants and a combined 1G and 2G plant, showing that savings of 40-47% could be made in hot utilities and 42-54% in cold utilities by heat integration.\nFor all cases it can clearly been seen that the total cost, in this case including the discounted total direct cost of heat exchangers and the utilities, is lower in the cases with heat integration than in the corresponding cases without heat integration, the former being between 28 and 37% less expensive than the latter. The main cost item is the cost of utilities, which accounts for more than 75-90% of the total cost, depending on the case. Approximately 90% of the utility cost was for heating.\nThe energy requirement (electricity included) of producing 1 kg of ethanol was lower both for the heat integrated 1G and 2G configuration (17 MJ\/kg ethanol), and the co-located 1G and 2G stand-alone plants (19 MJ\/kg ethanol) compared with the 2G stand-alone plant (23 MJ\/kg). The energy demand of producing 1 kg of ethanol with the heat integrated 1G and 2G plant was similar to that of a 1G heat integrated stand-alone plant, which was 15 MJ\/kg.\nIt was also shown that with the plant capacities assumed here, only the 2G stand-alone plant and the combined 1G and 2G plant were self-sufficient in heat by burning the residual material and biogas produced in the process. In the other cases external energy had to be added to supply the process with heat. Heat had to be supplied to the 1G plant as it was assumed that the DDGS produced would be sold, and thus no residual material would be available for incineration. The residual material obtained from the 2G process was not enough to supply both the 1G and 2G plants with energy. However, a reduction of about 30% in the external energy required for heating in the 1G plant could be accomplished, while completely satisfying the heat demand in the 2G plant.\nThe energy efficiency of the ethanol production process is an ongoing challenge. The flue gas, which leaves the CHP plant at 150\u00b0C, can be used to supply the dryer with heat, reducing the hot air needed in the drying process. MVR can be used to increase the pressure of the overhead vapor leaving the evaporation stage. This vapor could then potentially replace some of the live steam in the liquefaction step. Investigations on extracting the distillation, evaporation and the pretreatment stages from the rest of the streams in the background process are also recommended to identify possible additional savings in heating and cooling demand. The ratio of raw material loading between the 1G and 2G plant is a crucial factor, for the latter one to being able to supply the 1G plant with heat."}
{"text":" The implementation of pinch analysis by connecting a heat integrated bioethanol and CHP plant to a local district heating network, may improve the heat utilization but a techno-economical evaluation which can verify the cost effectiveness should be performed.\nProcess model\nA facility with the potential to include both a 1G and 2G ethanol plant operating for 8000 hours per year was considered. An annual ethanol production of approximately 142000 m3 was assumed for the 1G and 2G plants. This would corresponds to a 1G raw material loading of 30 ton dry wheat kernels per hour and 2G raw material loading of 25 ton dry wheat straw per hour assuming an ethanol production of about 101000 m3\/annum for the 1G plant and 41000 m3\/annum for the 2G plant.\nSimulations for 1G and 2G ethanol plant configurations were carried out using the simulation program Aspen Plus, implementing experimental data from lab-scale work performed by Linde et al. [32] and Erdei et al. [33], and the process development unit at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Lund University. The models for the 2G plant used in this study were modified versions of previous models developed by Wingren et al. [19],[34] and Sassner et al. [35]. One of the major differences in the current model compared with that studied by Sassner et al. [35] is the choice of different materials; in this case wheat straw, instead of wood. Therefore, the yield and design were adjusted to the use of wheat straw. The production of lignin pellets was not either considered in this study; instead the residual material produced in the 2G process, including lignin, was primarily intended for combustion. In some of the configurations where 1G ethanol production was included, DDGS were also produced, and it was assumed that these would be sold for use as animal feed. Lab-scale data were used to model the pretreatment and the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) steps in the simulation of a 2G plant.\nSimulations were carried out for a 1G stand-alone plant, for a 2G stand-alone plant, for co-located 1G and 2G stand-alone plants and for a 1G and 2G plant combined prior to distillation. Heat integration was implemented in these four cases and the cost of utilities and the total direct cost for heat exchangers were calculated. Non-heat integrated cases were chosen as references as no existing plant data are available for the 2G case to this date that could serve as a base case for the analysis. The reference cases will therefore indicate the least favorable energy utilization but they were chosen to facilitate the model comparison and illustrate the potential of energy integration. The process designs for the two stand-alone plants and the combined plants are described below. The co-located 1G and 2G case is simply a combination of the two stand-alone plants, and is therefore not described separately. The raw material loadings, surplus heat added, conversion factors in enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation and products are listed in Table 5 for the various cases. The conversion factors and products are described more closely under each plant description section and the Results section, respectively. The surplus heat added, represented in the table as natural gas, is described further under the Energy supply section.\nTable 5 Plant capacity and conversion factors\nDescription of the 1G stand-alone plant\nIt was assumed that wheat kernels were mixed with a blend of fresh and recirculated water in a mixing tank to produce a mash that was preheated to 60\u00b0C. The mash was further heated by injecting live steam at 94\u00b0C. An enzyme mixture consisting of \u03b1-amylases was added to the mash and liquefaction was carried out at 90\u00b0C [36]. The mash was cooled to 37\u00b0C and then mixed with fresh water, cooling it further to 32\u00b0C before saccharification and fermentation. The process configuration for the 1G stand-alone ethanol plant is illustrated in Figure 9.\nProcess scheme for the 1G stand-alone ethanol plant.\nSSF in 1G\nThe cooled, diluted mash was fed into a fermentor where additional enzymes were added, and SSF was performed at 32\u00b0C.Water was added to achieve a final ethanol concentration of 8% by weight. The ethanol yield over fermentation for the 1G starch material was obtained in lab-scale experiments performed by Erdei et al. [33]. Based on the results, starch to glucose conversion after the enzymatic hydrolysis was set to 0.99 and the glucose-to-ethanol yield in fermentation was set to 0.94, referring to the starch content of the substrate. The starch to ethanol yield over the 1G SSF process will then be set to 0.93 as can be seen in Table 5.\nDistillation in 1G\nThe 1G distillation process is assumed to consist of a 30-stage,"}
{"text":" low-pressure stripper column followed by a 60-stage, high-pressure rectifying column. The temperature in the stripper column is restricted to about 100\u00b0C due to the risk of gluten fouling in the column. The SSF broth is preheated to 91\u00b0C before entering the stripper column, operating at a top-stage pressure of 1 bar and a Murphree efficiency of 50%. Overhead vapor from the stripper containing an ethanol concentration of about 50% was condensed and preheated to 120\u00b0C before being fed to a rectifying column, which operates at a top-stage pressure of 3.5 bar, having a Murphree efficiency of 75%. The reflux ratio was shifting slightly between the non-heat integrated and heat integrated rectifying columns to a final value of about 4.2 and 3.9 for the non-heat integrated and heat integrated, respectively. The vapor exiting the rectifier, containing an ethanol concentration of 92.5%, is superheated to 130\u00b0C and then fed to a molecular sieve for further dehydration. The dehydrated ethanol stream is modeled as containing 99.5% ethanol. The rejected stream is condensed at 113\u00b0C and recirculated back to the rectifying column. The dehydrated ethanol is condensed and then cooled to a temperature of 35\u00b0C. Stillage from the stripper column (thick stillage), containing liquids and solids, is cooled to 80\u00b0C before being transferred to a solid-liquid separation step. The rectifying stillage is cooled to 45\u00b0C and part of it is recirculated to the liquefaction step, while the remainder is sent to a waste-water treatment (WWT) unit.\nEvaporation and solids separation in 1G\nSolid-liquid separation is applied to the thick stillage, containing a dry matter of 11%, to remove most of the solids from the liquid to achieve a thin stillage. Separation is assumed to be carried out with a filter unit with a solids retention of about 95% [37]. The thin stillage and the wet cake have dry matter contents of approximately 5% and 60%, respectively. The thin stillage was heated to 128\u00b0C before being sent to the evaporator.\nThe evaporation unit is modeled as a five-effect, forward-feed evaporation system. The boiling point elevation is modeled according to an expression presented by Larsson et al. [38]. The outgoing liquid fraction, referred to as the syrup, is assumed to contain 60% solids (dry matter) and to leave the evaporator at a pressure of 0.2 bar. The first-effect evaporator is supplied with steam at 6 bar as heating medium. The overhead vapor from the last effect of the evaporator is condensed at about 63\u00b0C, cooled to 45\u00b0C, and partly used as recirculation water; the excess being sent to the WWT unit. The condensate resulting from the five evaporation effects is likewise cooled to 45\u00b0C before being sent to the WWT.\nAfter evaporation, the syrup and the wet cake are mixed and fed to an air dryer. The dryer is assumed to operate at an ingoing air temperature of 150\u00b0C and a discharge temperature of 90\u00b0C. Seventy percent of the outgoing air is recirculated and mixed with preheated fresh air. The incoming fresh air is assumed to have a water content of 0.005 kg H2O\/kg dry air, and is heated from 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C before being mixed. The air mixture is heated to 150\u00b0C before entering the dryer. The dry matter content of the outgoing DDGS is set to 88% [39].\nPretreatment was modeled based on lab-scale results obtained using wheat straw impregnated with H2SO4, which was pretreated in a 10-L steam-pretreatment unit, as described by Palmqvist et al. [40]. The pretreatment conditions and the impregnation procedure, utilizing an aqueous solution of 0.2% H2SO4, are described in more detail by Linde et al. [32]. Steam pretreatment was carried out for 10 min at a temperature of 190\u00b0C. The process configuration for the 2G stand-alone ethanol plant is shown in Figure 10.\nIt was assumed that the reactor is operated with 20-bar steam, corresponding to a reactor temperature of 190\u00b0C, and is modeled as a continuous reactor with 10% higher steam consumption than an adiabatic unit to account for heat losses. Pretreated material is assumed to be cooled by flashing at 4 and 1 bar. The flashed steam contains volatile compounds and, after condensation and cooling to 45\u00b0C, is fed to the WWT unit. Part of the flashed steam at 4 and 1 bar is not condensed, but instead recirculated and mixed with the incoming wheat straw to preheat the straw to 96"}
{"text":"\u00b0C. After flashing, the pretreated material (slurry) is cooled from 100\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C before mixing with fresh water prior to SSF.\nSSF and yeast cultivation in 2G\nYeast is assumed to be produced on-site, since SSF makes yeast recirculation difficult. As a consequence, part of the pretreated slurry is pressed and the liquid collected for use in yeast cultivation. The liquid is supplemented with molasses to achieve a sufficiently high sugar concentration before being used for cultivation. The conversion of sugar to yeast was assumed to be 0.5 g biomass\/g fermentable sugar in the simulations, and 2 g\/L yeast is added in SSF. The concentration of the incoming material to 2G SSF is set to 10% WIS, and the temperature to 35\u00b0C. Enzymes are presumed to be purchased and added to achieve an activity corresponding to 10 FPU\/g WIS. The ethanol yield for the 2G fermentation process is set to 0.84, with a sugar yield of 0.91 after enzymatic hydrolysis, and a glucose-to-ethanol conversion of 0.92, based on results reported by Linde et al. [32]. The ethanol concentration after the SSF in the broth that will be transfered to the distillation step would then be approximatly 2.7%.\nThe 2G distillation process consists of two parallel 25-stage stripper columns operated at 3 and 1 bar (Murphree efficiency 50%), and a 45-stage rectifying column operated at 0.25 bar (Murphree efficiency 75%). The SSF broth is divided into two equal streams and preheated to feed temperatures of 123\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C, before being sent to the stripper columns. After stripping, the overhead vapors are condensed and subsequently mixed with the rejected stream from the molecular sieve before being transferred to the rectifier. The intermediate stream fed to the rectifier would contain an ethanol concentration of about 26% and the reflux ratio for the non-heat integrated and the heat integrated case rectifier column was about 1.3 in both cases. The overhead vapor from the rectifier is heated from 50\u00b0C to 75\u00b0C and then fed to the molecular sieve, where it is assumed to reach an ethanol concentration of 99.5% before being condensed and cooled to 35\u00b0C. The rejected stream is condensed at 52\u00b0C before being recirculated to the rectifier. Thick stillage from the stripper columns is mixed and cooled to 80\u00b0C, as in the 1st generation plant, and the rectifier stillage is cooled to 45\u00b0C.\nEvaporation in 2G\nIn the model a large part of the process water was assumed to be recirculated back to the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation step. This water normally contains compounds generated in the pretreatment step that can be toxic to the yeast if present in large amounts. Evaporation was therefore used to help reduce the toxic compounds present in the water, which otherwise will inhibit the yeast in the fermentation step. Potentially, syrup from the 2G evaporation step can also be diverted to the DDGS to increase the sugar amount in the product. Evaporation and the separation of solids are carried out in the same way as described for the 1G process. However, in this configuration, the syrup and the wet cake are burned in a CHP unit.\nAnaerobic digestion and waste water treatment\nIt is assumed that biogas is produced from the condensed flash steam from the pretreatment step, from rectifier stillage, and from evaporation condensate, using anaerobic digestion. Since a limited amount of experimental data is available regarding this type of mixed substrate, there is some uncertainty in the modeling of the anaerobic digestion and WWT steps. It is assumed that the methane production corresponds to 0.35 m3\/kg consumed chemical oxygen demand [41]. The amount of consumed chemical oxygen demand in the biogas reactor is calculated assuming that easily digested material, such as organic acids and monomeric sugars, have a fractional conversion of 90%, compounds that require additional hydrolysis, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, have a fractional conversion of 50%, and that materials such as solid lignin, which are very difficult to hydrolyze are not converted.\nDescription of the combined 1st and 2nd generation plants\nThe 1G and 2G ethanol plants were integrated in two different ways. In the first case, only heat integration between the stand-alone plants, i.e. utilization of heat and sink sources, was considered. This is referred to as the co-located plants case. In the second scenario, both the energy and material streams were integrated by combining the fermentation broths prior to distillation, and altering the distillation step and the final products compared to the stand-alone cases. This is"}
{"text":" referred to as the combined plant case. In the latter case no DDGS are produced since the broths from the 1G and 2G plants are mixed prior to distillation. The thick stillage is sent for separation and evaporation before being incinerated, and thus, no dryer is needed. The process configuration for the combined 1G and 2G plant is shown in Figure 11.\nProcess scheme for the combined 1G and 2G ethanol plant.\nThe distillation step is modeled using one stripper column with a top-stage pressure of 1.25 bar, and a rectifying column operating at 0.25 bar. The Murphree efficiency and the number of stages are the same as in the 2G scenario. The SSF broth from the combined plant is heated from 35\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C before entering the stripper column. Overhead vapor from the stripper is condensed and mixed with the reject stream from the dehydration step before being fed to the rectifier. The ethanol concentration in the stream fed to the rectifier was about 42% and the reflux ratio in the rectifier column was about 1.2 in both the non-heat integrated and the heat integrated case. After distillation, the vapor is heated to 72\u00b0C, dehydrated, and cooled to 35\u00b0C.\nEnergy supply\nSteam at three different pressures is used in the simulations of utilities, depending on the configuration. For the 1G stand-alone plant, a moderate pressure of 6 bar and a low pressure of 4 bar are assumed to be required; 6 bar is chosen since the dryer is designed to be operating at 150\u00b0C. In the 2G plant, high-pressure steam at 20 bar and low-pressure steam at 4 bar are chosen since pretreatment is carried out at 190\u00b0C, and the rest of the process is operated below 140\u00b0C. In the combined plant it is presumed that steam at all three pressures is available from the beginning of the process. It is assumed that cooling water between 10-19\u00b0C at a pressure of 1 bar is used in all plants. In all cases except the 1G stand-alone plant, it is also assumed that a CHP plant supplies the ethanol plants with steam. Primary steam is designed to be produced at 91 bar and 470\u00b0C, and electricity is produced by a steam turbine and a back-pressure turbine. The CHP plant is not included in the pinch analysis. The CHP system is designed to be used to incinerate residual material (excluding any DDGS production) and biogas produced in the process. The residual material consists of a mixture of solids from the separation step after distillation and syrup from evaporation. When the incineration of residual material and biogas is not sufficient to run the process, natural gas, assumed to be pure methane, was added. The 1G stand-alone plant is presumed to be entirely powered by natural gas, as this is relatively common in the corn ethanol plants operating in the USA today [42]. Optionally, straw could have been used as external energy, however, methane was used in this case for easy comparison with existing infrastructure. Other sources of energy can be used to run the 1G plant. For example, sugarcane ethanol plants are often supplied with energy from the incineration of bagasse [43] and residual materials from the field, while at the 1G wheat ethanol plant in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden, biomass and domestic waste are used to produce steam [44]. The electricity needed in the plants was included when calculating the energy need to produce one kg of ethanol, by assuming an electricity requirement of 0.84 MJ\/kg ethanol. The assumption was made as there are limited data available concerning the energy used for electricity in the considered cases. This value corresponds to an average electricity demand described in a 1G ethanol corn plant [29].\nFor the composition of wheat kernels, average values were calculated based on data compiled by Erdei et al. [33] and data found in the literature [45]-[47]. Data on the composition of wheat straw were taken from a study performed by Linde et al. [32] for straw collected in southern Sweden. The wheat straw and kernels were assumed to have dry matter contents of 88% and 86%, respectively. The dry matter compositions of straw and kernels are presented in Table 6.\nTable 6 The composition of wheat kernels and wheat straw (% dry basis)\nFour base cases were analyzed: a stand-alone 1G plant and a stand-alone 2G plant, a co-location of a 1G and a 2G stand-alone plant in which only energy was considered for integration, and finally a combined plant in which both the energy and material streams of a 1G and 2G plant were combined. In the combined case SSF broths from the 1G and 2G plants were mixed prior to distillation.\nIt was assumed in the base case that the streams in the plants were heated and cooled with utilities"}
{"text":" only. The base cases were compared with cases in which utilities and energy integration, through heat exchange, supplied the process with the energy necessary for heating and cooling. This resulted in eight different cases; the four base cases, and the four cases with utilities and energy integration by heat exchange.\nPinch analysis\nAspen Energy Analyzer (AEA) version 7.2 was used to design heat exchanger networks, locate the pinch temperature and calculate the energy targets for each of the simulated scenarios. The program can produce recommended network designs and perform cost estimates automatically. However, these features were not utilized in this study since the automatically generated network designs do not always consider pinch violation, stream splitting, the location of streams and the condensation and evaporation of streams in a satisfactory way. The automatic cost estimates were not used since they are based on older data and not sufficiently flexible to changes. Instead, Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) version 7.2.1 was used to estimate the investment cost of heat exchanging equipment.\nThe initial and final temperatures, the flow rates and the heat loads of the streams were exported from Aspen Plus. The overall mass heat capacity was calculated using the heat load and the temperature before being inserted into AEA version 7.2. The global minimum temperature difference (\u0394T) in the heat exchangers was set to 10\u00b0C, but lower and higher temperature variations were applied to specific streams. No changes, such as varying the pressures in the distillation or evaporation stages, or modifying the drying gas in the dryer, were made to the original processes. These investigations can be performed by extracting the selected stages from the analysis, the remaining energy flows will then be known as the background process.\nSome restrictions and considerations were taken into account when modeling the heat exchanger network to make the simulations more applicable in real industrial processes. Heat exchange was not allowed between evaporating or condensing streams unless the stream in question was completely evaporated or condensed during heat exchange. Stream splitting was kept to a minimum by only allowing a stream to be split once. The physical locations of the streams in the facility must be considered when modeling the heat exchanger networks. In this study, heat exchange in the CHP plant or between the ethanol and CHP plant was omitted from the evaluation, also no heat exchange was carried out between the effects inside the evaporation stage and the rest of the process; in this case only the incoming and outgoing streams from the unit were included in the network. No heat exchange was allowed in stages where live steam was used, i.e. pretreatment and liquefaction; however, the heat required was still included since this indicates the potential for live steam replacement with secondary steam. The streams considered in the pinch analysis for the different scenarios are listed in Tables'7, 8 and 9. The co-located case is simply a combination of the 1G and 2G stand-alone cases, and is therefore not described separately.\nTable 7 Stream data for the 1G stand-alone ethanol plant\nTable 9 Stream data for the combined 1G and 2G ethanol plant\nCost calculations\nEstimates of the cost of heat exchangers were obtained using APEA version 7.2.1, using the heat transfer areas generated in AEA version 7.2, and temperature settings from Aspen Plus. The maximum design pressure was set to 10 bar. The tube and shell material were chosen to be stainless steel, SS316. The heat exchanger area was overestimated by 15%. Thereafter, the total direct costs (equipment and installation cost) were calculated for all eight scenarios assuming an European plant location. The total direct costs were discounted using the annuity method with an internal rate of return of 7% and an economic lifetime of 15 years.\nThe cost of utilities was calculated based on the total amount of cooling water, 4-, 6- and 20-bar steam calculated in the Aspen Plus simulations, and the following energy prices: cooling water 0.016 EUR\/ton, 4- and 6-bar steam 20 EUR\/ton, and 20-bar steam 25 EUR\/ton.\nThe discounted total direct cost was added to the total annual cost of utilities to give an annual total cost. The total investment cost for the plant was not calculated, and no extra costs for piping were included.\nEJ designed and carried out the simulation study and drafted the manuscript.

{"text":"Ten New Insights in Climate Science 2021 report highlights critical research and policy implications for addressing the climate crisis\nNewsVideos\nTen New Insights in Climate Change, published today by Future Earth, the Earth League and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), summarizes the latest science on the pressing and interconnected risks of our climate crisis, as well as on the action needed to curb dangerous change.\nThe report, which was presented today to Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), provides a horizon scan of the 10 most pressing research findings and emerging scientific insights from 2021. A recording of the press conference with Patricia Espinosa is available to watch here.\nTen New Insights in Climate Change highlights findings on climate from across a range of scientific disciplines, including the increase in megafires across the world, and new economic analysis that justifies the costs of rapid climate action. The 2021 report also includes targeted policy recommendations at different levels, from the local to the regional and global, and was shared early with COP26 delegates to help spark action on the climate crisis.\nThe latest insights warn that we are on the verge of or already past the point of exhausting the carbon budget for exceeding global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and that achieving the Paris Agreement target will only be possible with immediate, unprecedented transformations across all sectors. The authors urge decision-makers to establish agressive mid-term goals for reducing greenhouse gases (e.g. 50% reduction by 2030), and to set an ambition of net-zero by 2040. The kind of transformations required demand rapid, coordinated global action to support lower-income countries to transition away from carbon-intensive energy production, as well as holding the highest emitters to account.\nThe findings in the report also demonstrate the extent to which different risks are interconnected. As global temperature increases, so too does the risk of carbon-feedback cycles that may lower the threshold for climate tipping points, such as glacial melting and associated sea level rise.\nAs policy-makers meet in Glasgow for COP26, the findings are 'a strong call to decision-makers to meet the urgency of the state of our climate and help put us back on a path to a sustainable future,' said Detlef Stammer, Professor at the University of Hamburg and Joint Scientific Committee Chair of the World Climate Research Programme.\n'Our knowledge of the climate system has grown rapidly in recent years, but policy-making has yet to catch up with these critical advances.'\nDetlef Stammer, Professor at the University of Hamburg and Joint Scientific Committee Chair of the World Climate Research Programme.\nThe new research highlighted in the report also demonstrates that the costs of mitigating climate change are far outweighed by immediate co-benefits to both people and planet, such as the restoration of natural ecosystems \u2013 which also represent high economic value \u2013 as well as many improvements to human health and well-being. For example, action to improve air quality could dramatically lower the 6.67 million deaths caused by air pollution annually, and it is estimated that in many large economies, the cost savings from reduced air pollution alone will offset the costs of mitigation, even in the short term.\nThis year's top insights:\nStabilizing at 1.5\u00b0C warming is still possible, but immediate and drastic global action is required.\nRapid growth in methane and nitrous oxide emissions put us on track for 2.7\u00b0C warming.\nMegafires \u2013 climate change forces fire extremes to reach new dimensions with extreme impacts.\nClimate tipping elements incur high-impact risks.\nGlobal climate action must be just.\nSupporting household behaviour changes is a crucial but often overlooked opportunity for climate action.\nPolitical challenges impede the effectiveness of carbon pricing.\nNature-based solutions are critical for the pathway to Paris \u2013 but look at the fine print.\nBuilding resilience of marine ecosystems is achievable by climate-adapted conservation and management, and global stewardship.\nThe costs of climate change mitigation can be justified by the multiple immediate benefits to the health of humans and nature.\nExplore the full report.\nThe report is adapted from peer-reviewed article, and was drafted by a consortium of 54 leading climate researchers from 21 countries. It is published by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and Future Earth \u2013 which are affiliated bodies of the International Science Council \u2013 and the Earth League.\nPhoto: Bushfires on December 31, 2019 burning along the east coast of Australia.

However, while technology has brought extreme advances in areas ranging from computers and smartphones to scanners and sequencers, mobility options have remained essentially unchanged for decades - until now. Smartphone-enabled ridesharing is in everyday usage, electric vehicles are now mass production, and we are witnessing the dawn of autonomous vehicles that will soon becoming commonplace. Other mobility services - from on-demand bicycles and scooters to \"ride-pooling\" and WiFi-outfitted mass transit - are also providing better options for people, and cities, and leading companies are exploring hyperloops, flying taxis and more. Which technologies will become commonplace, how much impact will they have on our lives, and what else is on the horizon to address transportation needs and mobility options? How will these changes transform work, communities, and society? We have a panel of Austin transportation experts ready to explain all this and more, and to answer your questions.

James Howard Kunstler's book, \"The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the 21st century\" could have been titled the permanent emergency. Once oil begins to decline globally in earnest, within 20 years there'll be 10% or less of oil left (unless wars end oil sooner and faster than that), and oil and other fossils are what allowed humans to expand from about 1 billion to 7.8 billion today.\nSo, when people emerge from their bunkers, they'd better know how to farm and be living on arable land with adequate rainfall.\nYou can't run from the \"end of the world\" to a bunker. It's just a very fancy tombstone.\nMost of what follows comes from the ter"}

Billionaires aren't the only ones prepping for doomsday, but they could be the most prepared if the world gets hit by an asteroid or nuclear missile. In recent years, companies have built \"billionaire bunkers\" that cater to the apocalyptic fears of the superrich.\nThe effects of climate change have become more frequent and severe, threatening vulnerable areas with floods, hurricanes, and extreme heat. Machines have become more intelligent, leading some to worry about a technological overthrow of society. And the possibility ofglobal nuclear warfare looms even larger, with North Korea continuing to advance its nuclear weapons program.\nPredicting one of these unlikely doomsday scenarios may be impossible, but planning for them isn't if you're a member of the 1%. Take a look at the \"billionaire bunkers\" that could house the super rich during an apocalypse.\nAmid growing threats to the safety of our planet, a small group of elites \u2014 namely, Silicon Valley execs and New York City financiers \u2014 have started to discuss their doomsday plans over dinner.\nIn some cases, these conversations have prompted wealthy individuals to purchase underground bunkers to shelter themselves during a disaster.\n\"Billionaire bunkers\" don't need to be built from scratch.\nA few companies now manufacture luxury doomsday shelters that cater to super rich clientele. The Vivos Group, a company based in Del Mar, California, is building a \"global underground shelter network\" for high-end clients.\nTheir fanciest compound, known as Europa One, is located beneath a 400-foot-tall mountain in the village of Rothenstein, Germany.\nThe shelter was once a storage space for Soviet military equipment during the Cold War, according to the company's website.\nIn exchange for purchasing a bunker, residents are provided with a full-time staff and security team.\nThis property is designed to withstand a close-range nuclear blast, airline crash, earthquake, flood, or military attack.\nA typical living quarters has two floors.

That'll likely require some savings when it's unsafe to go outdoors.\nThe company has yet another shelter in Indiana, which can house just 80 people.\nThe Vivos website likens the shelter to \"a very comfortable 4-Star hotel.\"\nThe communal living room has 12-foot-high ceilings.\nResidents aren't expected to bring anything other than clothing and medication."}

Solar panels would probably not be practical since they would need to be exposed to sunlight (duh) and could be easily destroyed by the \"hordes.\" Or will the sharpshooters eliminate that problem? Possibly gasoline powered generators would solve the problem \u2013 except that they require lots of gasoline (another duh) as well exhaust pipes running to the surface \u2013 exposure to those \"hordes\" again. If anyone has any first-hand knowledge about what energy source might be utilized please share it.\nvimingok says:\nAs someone who has occasionally brushed up against billionaires, even those \"luxury\" bunkers look like suburban professionals' idea of opulence and coolness. They're marketed to that type of slob, not the ultra wealthy.\nThe masters of the universe have always understood that space + time = power. So apocalyptic bunkers for that class of people would be outrageously large and house no more than a dozen tops \u2013 close family members only, at best. Provisions would have to last several years at least, and underground farming is a must. Power systems could range from mini reactors to biofuel. Technological fripperies like home cinema would be low on the list of priorities.\nSo bunkers of that kind may well run you into the billions. What is more, you probably have to build them yourself!

{"text":"IEA holds high-level workshop on the future of electricity\nParticipants in the IEA's electricity workshop will help focus the work of the next World Energy Outlook's fuel focus on electricity (Photograph: IEA)\nThe future of electricity will be the \"fuel\" focus of the next World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency's flagship publication, to be released in mid-November.\nAs part of an agency-wide effort on this WEO electricity focus, the IEA hosted a high-level workshop in Paris on Tuesday, bringing together decision makers and leading experts from around the world to provide strategic guidance on the analysis and share their experience. The workshop marked a high point in the IEA's \"Year of Electricity,\" examining various aspects of the transformation of the electricity sector this year.\nThe workshop was attended by representatives from 75 organisations, covering a wide range from government, industry, utilities, manufacturers, downstream, consulting, industry associations, research and academia. It also included a broad regional coverage, with participants representing more than 40 countries, from the IEA family and beyond.\nThe future looks bright for electricity, which is set to grow at twice the rate of overall energy demand to 2040. In 2016, total power sector investment surpassed that of oil and gas for the first time, propelled by renewables, mostly solar and wind. Meanwhile 1.1 billion people still lack access to electricity globally, new demand is coming from electric mobility, digitalization, cooling and heating.\nAnd the nature of electricity supply is undergoing a major transition, from a century-old foundation of dispatchable fossil fuels to ever cheaper variable renewables, with related market reforms underway. The power sector is responsible for close to 40% of energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions, 60% of coal use and 36% of natural gas use. Understanding changes in the power sector is therefore essential to analysing progress towards environmental goals and understanding global energy trends.\nThe objectives of the WEO's focus on electricity will include:\n\u2013 Assessing the long-term outlook for electricity demand, with insights on traditional and new sources of demand growth such as electric vehicles, digitalization, cooling and energy access in developing countries, and the emerging need for responsive demand.\n\u2013 Providing in-depth analysis of the speed of the transition underway in electricity supply \u2013 highlighting global issues and regional perspectives \u2013 based on the latest market data, technology developments and government policies.\n\u2013 Investigating the implications on electricity security, environmental protection and economic development, with insights on market designs.\n\u2013 Exploring key uncertainties, resulting from the pace of deployment for new technologies, market and policy developments, and changing consumer preferences.\nIn addition, this year's WEO will also have a focus on oil and gas producing economies.\nRelated Topics:EconomicsEnergyIEA\nData USA adds more than 7,300 profiles of higher education institutions to visualization platform\nADB Operations Reach $32.2 Billion in 2017- ADB Annual Report\nLatin America and China: The difficulties in relations and Covid-19\nCovid third world debt will outlast the virus \u2013 it should be relieved\nRecovery action plan of the Union: On Next Generation EU & a New Independent authority?\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) Eleventh Assembly started today (Monday) and takes place virtually setting the course for a critical year of global commitments to low-carbon development. With the postponed COP26 set to take place later this year, 2021 is seen as an important moment for countries to raise climate mitigation ambition including renewable energy deployment, to align economic recovery efforts with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic defined 2020,\" said Francesco La Camera, IRENA Director-General. \"However, as countries look to recover from the devastating impacts of the pandemic and build back in a way that is more resilient, just and sustainable, we can define this year as the moment we placed the energy transition at the heart of global policy and investment decision making.\"\nThe opening day of the Assembly, marked as World Energy Transition Day, sets the direction for four days of high-level discussions on net-zero policies, national energy planning, renewable energy investment and the energy-healthcare nexus, from January 18-21. Close to 2000 high level attendees including Heads of State, Ministers, energy decision makers, multilateral organisations, international stakeholders, and private sector actors will engage in Assembly meetings under the overarching theme of 'COVID19 \u2013 Energy Transition'.\nUnited Nations Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told Ministers and global leaders at the Assembly: \"The trillions of dollars needed for recovery from the pandemic must be simultaneously used to move our economies towards net-zero emissions. We must build a global coalition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Renewable technologies are the first choice for decarbonization strategies.\"\nTeresa Ribera, Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Spain and Minister of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, is the President of the Assembly"}
{"text":".\n\"We are all well aware of the pressing need to change gears towards a sustainable energy future: with over 70% of GHG emissions coming from this sector, the energy transition plays a key role in managing the global climate emergency,\" said H.E. Teresa Ribera. \"Developing countries, economies in transition and highly industrialised countries all have huge opportunities in the decarbonisation of their development pathways: energy access and security, sound economic growth, industry modernisation, job creation.\n\"To us all, IRENA has become a lighthouse in the energy revolution we need,\" she added. \"Promoting innovation and widespread adoption of renewables and energy efficiency technologies and encouraging Governments to accelerate the transition. Spain is proud to align with IRENA's endeavours and I will be honoured to take the lead of its 11th Assembly in 2021.\"\nAssembly sessions on the 18th, 19th and 20th include a high-level panel on energy transformation for a sustainable post-COVID recovery, followed by four ministerial discussions covering the topics of national energy planning and implementation, scaling up of renewable energy financing, the pathway to carbon neutrality and the role of the energy transition in energising healthcare.\nAdditionally, conclusions from preliminary stakeholder meetings that took place on the 13th and 14th of January, including IRENA's Legislators Forum, Public-Private Dialogue and the IRENA Youth Forum, will be reported back to the Assembly. The Assembly, which takes place at the start of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), is being live-streamed on the IRENA website.\n\"IRENA's global mandate offers us a unique opportunity to convene global leaders, promote knowledge sharing and create the partnerships needed to advance low-carbon development and realise the immediate and long-term benefits of the transition,\" continued La Camera. \"The Assembly is at the heart of these efforts.\"\nThe World Economic Forum Davos Agenda, taking place virtually on 25-29 January, will bring together the foremost leaders of the world to address the new global situation. Heads of state and government, chief executives and leaders from civil society will convene under the theme: A Crucial Year to Rebuild Trust.\nThe meeting will focus on creating impact, rebuilding trust and shaping the policies and partnerships needed in 2021.\n\"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to reset priorities and the urgency to reform systems have been growing stronger around the world,\" said Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum. \"Rebuilding trust and increasing global cooperation are crucial to fostering innovative and bold solutions to stem the pandemic and drive a robust recovery. This unique meeting will be an opportunity for leaders to outline their vision and address the most important issues of our time, such as the need to accelerate job creation and to protect the environment.\"\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that no institution or individual alone can address the economic, environmental, social and technological challenges of our complex, interdependent world. The pandemic has accelerated systemic changes that were apparent before its inception. The fault lines that emerged in 2020 now appear as critical crossroads in 2021. The Davos Agenda will help leaders choose innovative and bold solutions to stem the pandemic and drive a robust recovery over the next year.\nThe five programme themes are:\n1. Designing cohesive, sustainable, resilient economic systems (25 January)\n2. Driving responsible industry transformation and growth (26 January)\n3. Enhancing stewardship of the global commons (27 January)\n4. Harnessing the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (28 January)\n5.

{"text":" of \"See Me: A Global Concert.\" The official programme of The Davos Agenda will begin on 25 January.\nChinese smartphones have garnered a pretty bad privacy reputation in the last few years, which stems from several issues, such as lack of consumers' trust and the fact that global political events have not really been in China's favor. Somewhere around the mid-2010s though, China's global image changed a lot for the better, especially with their appearance in the smartphone industry and when it comes to advances in 4G and 5G technology.\nThe smartphone industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the global technology industry. Particularly in the last decade, which gave us the smartphone revolution, global device sales have skyrocketed from just 100 million in 2007, to over 1.5 billion today. Smartphones are also the most popular way through which people access the internet, which makes this sector critical for tech companies.\n14 years ago now, we experienced the launch of the first Apple iPhone in 2007, which would undoubtedly mark the beginning of a new Information Age. As the years went by, we have seen big players such as Samsung entering the market, as well as most recently Chinese companies like Huawei and Xiaomi eating up global market share with their very affordable smartphones. It isn't just Huawei and Xiaomi, though, let's not forget Oppo and Vivo too, who have held small but stable market share, even gaining popularity in the United States.\nApple never really took off in China like it did in the rest of the world, as the nation favoured national production and local brand loyalty, but Apple has always been in demand there. Outside of China though, Apple had absolutely dominated the smartphone market for a long time with the entire world anxiously awaiting their next press conference, and what their new iPhone would be like. The market dominance then switched hands between Apple and Samsung for a few years, with Samsung being dominant most of the time.\nNow, however, the global smartphone market has changed. With so much competition on the horizon (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei), as well as Apple charging very lofty prices for their latest offerings (and having lost some of their charm along the way with radical design changes), Chinese players have adapted and grasped a firm hold on the market for the foreseeable future. Offering familiar minimalist design approaches that Apple is known for, as well as having totally revamped their marketing, Chinese smartphone brands are now a true contender to the established giants. Ultimately, the most important target market for Chinese smartphones is the US and EU markets.\nThere is a big problem there though, it looks like there are serious privacy issues that plague Chinese smartphones and their reputation. Let's look into this below.\nWhat Is The Problem With Chinese Smartphone Brands?\nWith news of Huawei being banned (Xiaomi is also blacklisted) from Western countries, their reputation is not in a good place. Today, there are many Chinese smartphone brands available, with Huawei and Xiaomi being the most recognizable internationally -the ones that have sold the most outside of China. Some of the other 'budget' brands are Honor and Realme, for example, which may not be known to most people. There are many more Chinese smartphone brands, but way too many to list.\nWith so much political tension between the US and China, what does this mean if you are planning to buy\/already own a Chinese smartphone? Unfortunately, it is a fact that Chinese smartphones have experienced many privacy and security related issues with their devices, which fall into the categories;\nPre-installed spyware\nMalware vulnerabilities\nHardware 'Backdoors'\nWeak encryption\nBeyond pre-installed malicious software in Chinese smartphones, there are additional risks from installing very popular Chinese-made social media apps, such as;\nTakeaways For Your General Smartphone Security\nHaving covered why there is so much negative buzz around Chinese smartphones and their privacy risks, let's remember that a lot of it comes from the political tension between China and the US. There have been countless allegations of spying, hacking and data risks. Beyond this, there is a more important fact for the regular user. It is that Chinese phones are Android-based, which has a much larger user base and is as such more susceptible to attacks.\nLet's emphasize one thing; yes, that doesn't mean that these devices are safe, but what is safe nowadays? Should this deter you, a regular citizen, from buying a Chinese smartphone? It is difficult to say what is considered'safe' nowadays, and depends a lot on who you are and whether your data is so sensitive that governments will try to access your phone (for most people, this is not an issue).\nHowever, for the privacy conscious individuals out there, there are some things you must implement for your safety and peace of mind, no matter what kind of device you use, or which country it comes from;\nAlways use a trustworthy Virtual Private Network, or VPN\nConsider that iOS may be safer than Android overall\nMake sure that you have a strong password on your phone"}

Fertilizers and pesticides emit greenhouse gases and yet, over the last forty years, their usage in Canada's agriculture sector has increased threefold. This has led to \"high-input \/ high-output\" farming. High input, because it's a form of agriculture that requires farmers to buy and deploy many resources; high output, because the end goal is to deliver high-yield crops.\nThis model isn't sustainable. Canadian farmers are facing several interrelated challenges. Because agriculture has become so expensive, farmers are now collectively $106 billion in debt. Farmers are further at risk because agribusinesses are eroding their control over seed supply. All crops start with seed. Biodiversity in the agriculture sector has decreased by 75% over the last century, which makes the sector especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\nSince 2013, SeedChange has been working with farmers and researchers across Canada to breed crops that grow well in local climates without the use of harmful chemicals, and ensuring farmers have control over seed.\nSeedChange is committed to helping farmers breed new diversity, and ensuring Canadians adapt their crops to environmental changes over time so the farm becomes a living gene bank. It is important to breed with the future consequences of climate change in mind. One of the best strategies is to switch to low-input farming. Current inputs are fossil-fuel intensive, accelerate carbon emissions, are toxic to people and the planet, and are also making farming very expensive. Reducing these inputs will deliver huge financial savings to farmers and greatly benefit the natural environment.\nSeedChange is now applying everything it's learnt at the community level to mobilize Canadians in support of safe, healthy and sustainable food. SeedChange is also partnering with the National Farmers Union to position farmers as leading voices in taking action on climate change and will be working with policymakers to help Canada meet its Paris Agreement targets on carbon emissions reductions. Agriculture must be part of the solution. Farmers can feed us and help heal our planet.\n\"If you want to improve livelihoods and support environmental stewardship, food is one of the most powerful vehicles we have.\" Jane Rabinowicz, Executive Director, SeedChange.\nCatalyst: Community Forests International\nCatalyst: FitSpirit\nCatalyst: PLUS1\nH3A 3L6\nThe McConnell Foundation is located on the traditional territory of the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka (Mohawk), a place which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange among various nations.\n\u00a9 2021 McConnell Foundation.

Ruby Leung\nWe developed alternative parameters settings for E3SM Atmospheric Model version 1. We study the impact of parameter changes on the fidelity of model climate, and implications for climate change studies. The recalibration reduces common and longstanding biases across cloud regimes in the model and produces weaker aerosol-cloud interactions and cloud feedbacks.\nDistinct surface response to black carbon aerosols\nTao Tang, Drew Shindell, Yuqiang Zhang, Apostolos Voulgarakis, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Gunnar Myhre, Gregory Faluvegi, Bj\u00f8rn H. Samset, Timothy Andrews, Dirk Olivi\u00e9, Toshihiko Takemura, and Xuhui Lee\nPrevious studies showed that black carbon (BC) could warm the surface with decreased incoming radiation. With climate models, we found that the surface energy redistribution plays a more crucial role in surface temperature compared with other forcing agents. Though BC could reduce the surface heating, the energy dissipates less efficiently, which is manifested by reduced convective and evaporative cooling, thereby warming the surface.\nHeterogeneity and chemical reactivity of the remote troposphere defined by aircraft measurements\nHao Guo, Clare M.

We find that increased sulfur emissions reduce precipitation, which is primarily dynamically driven due to spatial shifts in convection over the region. A significant increase in precipitation (up to ~\u200920\u2009%) is found only when both Indian and Chinese sulfate emissions are regulated.\nModel physics and chemistry causing intermodel disagreement within the VolMIP-Tambora Interactive Stratospheric Aerosol ensemble\nMargot Clyne, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Michael J.

Plummer, David Saint-Martin, Kengo Sudo, Simone Tilmes, and Yousuke Yamashita\nWe present an updated projection of Antarctic ozone hole recovery using an ensemble of chemistry\u2013climate models. To do so, we employ a method, more advanced and skilful than the current multi-model mean standard, which is applicable to other ensemble analyses. It calculates the performance and similarity of the models, which we then use to weight the model. Calculating model similarity allows us to account for models which are constructed from similar components.\nClimate and air quality impacts due to mitigation of non-methane near-term climate forcers\nRobert J.

Stjern, Gregory Faluvegi, and Bj\u00f8rn H. Samset\nBy using climate simulations, we found that both CO2 and black carbon aerosols could reduce low-level cloud cover, which is mainly due to changes in relative humidity, cloud water, dynamics, and stability. Because the impact of cloud on solar radiation is in effect only during daytime, such cloud reduction could enhance solar heating, thereby raising the daily maximum temperature by 10\u201350\u2009%, varying by region, which has great implications for extreme climate events and socioeconomic activity.\nSeasonal impact of biogenic very short-lived bromocarbons on lowermost"}

The seasonal VSLBr impact on mid-latitude lowermost stratospheric ozone is influenced by the heterogeneous reactivation processes of inorganic chlorine on ice crystals, with a clear increase in ozone destruction during spring and winter.\nSeventeen years of ozone sounding at L'Aquila, Italy: evidence of mid-latitude stratospheric ozone recovery and tropospheric profile changes\nDaniele Visioni, Giovanni Pitari, Vincenzo Rizi, Marco Iarlori, Irene Cionni, Ilaria Quaglia, Hideharu Akiyoshi, Slimane Bekki, Neal Butchart, Martin Chipperfield, Makoto Deushi, Sandip S.

We find that removing human-caused air pollutant emissions from certain world regions (such as the USA) results in warming of up to 0.15\u2009\u00b0C. We use our model output to calculate simple climate metrics that will allow for regional-scale climate impact estimates without the use of computationally demanding computer models.\nAttribution of Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) ozone radiative flux bias from satellites\nLe Kuai, Kevin W.

Oman, Helen Worden, Susan Kulawik, David Paynter, Andrea Stenke, and Markus Kunze\nThe tropospheric ozone increase from pre-industrial to the present day leads to a radiative forcing. The top-of-atmosphere outgoing fluxes at the ozone band are controlled by ozone, water vapor, and temperature. We demonstrate a method to attribute the models' flux biases to these key players using satellite-constrained instantaneous radiative kernels. The largest spread between models is found in the tropics, mainly driven by ozone and then water vapor.\nNovel"}

We find a large multi-model spread of the Arctic concentration of this CO-like tracer that is well correlated with the differences in the location of the midlatitude jet as well as the northern Hadley Cell edge.

The various and diffuse sources of methane as well and its oxidation by a very short lifetime radical challenge this assessment. We quantify the methane sources and sinks as well as their uncertainties based on both bottom-up and top-down approaches provided by a broad international scientific community.\nThe Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) for CMIP6\nBrian C. O'Neill, Claudia Tebaldi, Detlef P. van Vuuren, Veronika Eyring, Pierre Friedlingstein, George Hurtt, Reto Knutti, Elmar Kriegler, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Jason Lowe, Gerald A. Meehl, Richard Moss, Keywan Riahi, and Benjamin M. Sanderson\nThe Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. The design consists of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions. Climate model projections will facilitate integrated studies of climate change as well as address targeted scientific questions.\nThe effect of future ambient air pollution on human premature mortality to 2100 using output from the ACCMIP model ensemble\nRaquel A.

We also estimate the global mortality burden of ozone and PM2.5 in 2000 and each future period.\nRegional and global temperature response to anthropogenic SO2 emissions from China in three climate models\nMatthew Kasoar, Apostolos Voulgarakis, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lamarque, Drew T. Shindell, Nicolas Bellouin, William J. Collins, Greg Faluvegi, and Kostas Tsigaridis\nComputer models are our primary tool to investigate how fossil-fuel emissions are affecting the climate. Here, we used three different climate models to see how they simulate the response to removing sulfur dioxide emissions from China. We found that the models disagreed substantially on how large the climate effect is from the emissions in this region. This range of outcomes is concerning if scientists or policy makers have to rely on any one model when performing their own studies.\nA consistent prescription of stratospheric aerosol for both radiation and chemistry in the Community Earth System Model (CESM1)\nRyan Reynolds Neely III, Andrew J. Conley, Francis Vitt, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lamarque\nWe describe an updated scheme for prescribing stratospheric aerosol in the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). The inadequate response of the CESM1 to large volcanic disturbances to the stratospheric aerosol layer (such as the 1991 Pinatubo eruption) in comparison to observations motivates the need for a new parameterization. Simulations utilizing the new scheme successfully reproduce the observed global mean and local stratospheric temperature response to the Pinatubo eruption.\nInterpreting space-based trends in carbon monoxide with multiple models\nSarah A.

The simulations produce a positive trend over eastern China, contrary to the observed negative trend. This may indicate that the assumed emission trend over China is too positive.

Specifics of the model and details regarding the setup of the simulations are described. In additions, the main behavior of the model, including selected chemical species have been evaluated with climatological datasets. This paper is therefore a references for studies that use the provided model results.\nStride Search: a general algorithm for storm detection in high-resolution climate data\nPeter A. Bosler, Erika L. Roesler, Mark A. Taylor, and Miranda R. Mundt\nThis article discusses the problem of identifying extreme climate events such as intense storms within large climate data sets. The basic storm detection algorithm is reviewed, which splits the problem into two parts: a spatial search followed by a temporal correlation problem. A new algorithm, \"Stride Search,\" is introduced which is capable of searching for storms at all latitudes including the poles and has better performance than the commonly used grid point search.\nCESM\/CAM5 improvement and application: comparison and evaluation of updated CB05_GE and MOZART-4 gas-phase mechanisms and associated impacts on global air quality and climate\nJ. He, Y. Zhang, S. Tilmes, L. Emmons, J.-F. Lamarque, T. Glotfelty, A. Hodzic, and F. Vitt\nThe global simulations with CB05_GE and MOZART-4x predict similar chemical profiles for major gases compared to aircraft measurements, with better agreement for the NOy profile by CB05_GE. The SOA concentrations of SOA at four sites in CONUS and organic carbon over the IMPROVE sites are better predicted by MOZART-4x. The two simulations result in a global average difference of 0.5W m-2 in simulated shortwave cloud radiative forcing, with up to 13.6W m-2 over subtropical regions.\nLimited effect of anthropogenic nitrogen oxides on secondary organic aerosol formation\nY. Zheng, N. Unger, A. Hodzic, L. Emmons, C. Knote, S. Tilmes, J.-F. Lamarque, and P. Yu\nNitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important but complex role in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In this study we update the SOA scheme in a global 3-D chemistry-climate model by implementing a 4-product volatility basis set (VBS) framework with NOx-dependent yields and simplified aging parameterizations. We find that the SOA decrease in response to a 50% reduction in anthropogenic NOx emissions is limited due to the buffering in different chemical pathways.\nNO2 seasonal evolution in the north subtropical free troposphere\nM.

Tilmes\nThe NO2 seasonal evolution in the free troposphere (FT) has been established for the first time, based on a remote sensing technique (MAXDOAS) and thus avoiding the problems of the local pollution of in situ instruments. A clear seasonality has been found, with background levels of 20-40pptv. Evidence has been found on fast, direct injection of surface air into the free troposphere. This result might have implications on the FT distribution of halogens and other species with marine sources.\nDescription and evaluation of tropospheric chemistry and aerosols in the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2)\nS.

Val Martin, C. L. Heald, J.-F. Lamarque, S. Tilmes, L. K. Emmons, and B. A. Schichtel\nWe present for the first time the relative effect of climate, emissions, and land use change on ozone and PM25 over the United States, focusing on the national parks. Air quality in 2050 will likely be dominated by emission patterns, but climate and land use changes alone can lead to a substantial increase in air pollution over most of the US, with important implications for O3 air quality, visibility and ecosystem health degradation in the national parks.\nA negative feedback between anthropogenic ozone pollution and enhanced ocean emissions of iodine\nC.

In contrast to the earlier G4 GeoMIP experiment, which requires an emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the model, a prescribed aerosol forcing file is provided to the community, to be consistently applied to future model experiments.\nBromine partitioning in the tropical tropopause layer: implications for stratospheric injection\nR. P. Fernandez, R. J. Salawitch, D. E. Kinnison, J.-F. Lamarque, and A. Saiz-Lopez\nWe propose the existence of a daytime \"tropical ring of atomic bromine\" surrounding the tropics at a height between 15 and 19km. Our simulations show that VSL bromocarbons produce increases of 3pptv for inorganic bromine and 2pptv for organic bromine in the tropical TTL on an annual average, resulting in a total stratospheric bromine injection of 5pptv. This result suggests that the inorganic bromine injected into the stratosphere may be larger than that from VSL bromocarbons.\nIodine chemistry in the troposphere and its effect on ozone\nA.

Our method is robust to the sparsity of observation networks and can predict more accurately than a process-based model when it is biased. Our method effectively works when both observations and models are imperfect, which is often the case in geoscience.

However, many existing models are aimed at simulating 10- to 100-year time periods do not represent a vertical dimension and are thus unable to include the effect of sea-level rise. The Coastline Evolution Model 2D (CEM2D) presented in this paper is an advance in this field, with the inclusion of the vertical coastal profile against which the water level can be altered.\nAn iterative process for efficient optimisation of parameters in geoscientific models: a demonstration using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) version 0.7.3\nSteven J. Phipps, Jason L. Roberts, and Matt A. King\nSimplified schemes, known as parameterisations, are sometimes used to describe physical processes within numerical models. However, the values of the parameters are uncertain. This introduces uncertainty into the model outputs. We develop a simple approach to identify plausible ranges for model parameters. Using a model of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, we find that the value of one parameter can depend on the values of others. We conclude that a single optimal set of parameter values does not exist.\nOcean Plastic Assimilator v0.2: assimilation of plastic concentration data into Lagrangian dispersion models\nAxel Peytavin, Bruno Sainte-Rose, Gael Forget, and Jean-Michel Campin\nWe present a new algorithm developed at The Ocean Cleanup to update ocean plastic models based on measurements from the field to improve future cleaning operations. Prepared in collaboration with MIT researchers, this initial study presents its use in several analytical and real test cases in which two observers in a flow field record regular observations to update a plastic forecast. We demonstrate this improves the prediction, even with inaccurate knowledge of the water flows driving plastic.\nDevelopment of a moving point source model for shipping emission dispersion modeling in EPISODE\u2013CityChem v1.3\nKang Pan, Mei Qi Lim, Markus Kraft, and Epaminondas Mastorakos\nA new moving point source (MPS) model was developed to simulate the dispersion of emissions generated by the moving ships. Compared to the commonly used line source (LS) or fixed point source (FPS) model, the MPS model provides more emission distribution details generated by the moving ships and matches reasonably with the measurements. Therefore, the MPS model should be a valuable alternative for the environmental society to evaluate the pollutant dispersion contributed from the moving ships.\nEfficient Bayesian inference for large chaotic dynamical systems\nSebastian Springer, Heikki Haario, Jouni Susiluoto"}
{"text":", Aleksandr Bibov, Andrew Davis, and Youssef Marzouk\nModel predictions always contain uncertainty. But in some cases, such as weather forecasting or climate modeling, chaotic unpredictability increases the difficulty to say exactly how much uncertainty there is. We combine two recently proposed mathematical methods to show how the uncertainty can be analyzed in models that are simplifications of true weather models. The results can be extended in the future to show how forecasts from large-scale models can be improved.\nConstraining stochastic 3-D structural geological models with topology information using approximate Bayesian computation in GemPy 2.1\nAlexander Schaaf, Miguel de la Varga, Florian Wellmann, and Clare E. Bond\nUncertainty is an inherent property of any model of the subsurface. We show how geological topology information \u2013 how different regions of rocks in the subsurface are connected \u2013 can be used to train uncertain geological models to reduce uncertainty. More widely, the method demonstrates the use of probabilistic machine learning (Bayesian inference) to train structural geological models on auxiliary geological knowledge that can be encoded in graph structures.\nRetrieval of process rate parameters in the general dynamic equation for aerosols using Bayesian state estimation: BAYROSOL1.0\nMatthew Ozon, Aku Sepp\u00e4nen, Jari P. Kaipio, and Kari E. J. Lehtinen\nExperimental research has provided large amounts of high-quality data on aerosol over the last 2 decades. However, inference of the process rates (e.g., the rates at which particles are generated) is still typically done by simple curve-fitting methods and does not assess the credibility of the estimation. The devised method takes advantage of the Bayesian framework to not only retrieve the state of the observed aerosol system but also to estimate the process rates (e.g., growth rate).\nA discontinuous Galerkin finite-element model for fast channelized lava flows v1.0\nColton J. Conroy and Einat Lev\nLava flows present a natural hazard to communities around volcanoes and are usually slow-moving (<\u20091-5\u2009cm\/s). Lava flows during the 2018 eruption of Kilauea volcano, Hawai'i, however, reached speeds as high as 11\u2009m\/s. To investigate these dynamics we develop a new lava flow computer model that incorporates a nonlinear expression for the fluid viscosity. Model results indicate that the lava flows at Site 8 of the eruption displayed shear thickening behavior due to the flow's high bubble content.\nA nested multi-scale system implemented in the large-eddy simulation model PALM model system 6.0\nAntti Hellsten, Klaus Ketelsen, Matthias S\u00fchring, Mikko Auvinen, Bj\u00f6rn Maronga, Christoph Knigge, Fotios Barmpas, Georgios Tsegas, Nicolas Moussiopoulos, and Siegfried Raasch\nLarge-eddy simulation (LES) of the urban atmospheric boundary layer involves a large separation of turbulent scales, leading to prohibitive computational costs. An online LES\u2013LES nesting scheme is implemented into the PALM model system 6.0 to overcome this problem. Test results show that the accuracy within the high-resolution nest domains approach the non-nested high-resolution reference results. The nesting can reduce the CPU by time up to 80\u2009% compared to the fine-resolution reference runs.\nExtending legacy climate models by adaptive mesh refinement for single-component tracer transport: a case study with ECHAM6-HAMMOZ (ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0)\nYumeng Chen, Konrad Simon, and J\u00f6rn Behrens\nMesh adaptivity can reduce overall model error by only refining meshes in specific areas where it us necessary in the runtime. Here we suggest a way to integrate mesh adaptivity into an existing Earth system model, ECHAM6, without having to redesign the implementation from scratch. We show that while the additional computational effort is manageable, the error can be reduced compared to a low-resolution standard model using an idealized test and relatively realistic dust transport tests.\nUsing the Despr\u00e9s and Lagouti\u00e8re (1999) antidiffusive transport scheme: a promising and novel method against excessive vertical diffusion in chemistry-transport models\nSylvain Mailler, Romain Pennel, Laurent Menut, and Mathieu Lach\u00e2tre\nRepresenting the advection of thin polluted plumes in numerical models is a challenging task since these models usually tend to excessively diffuse these plumes in the vertical direction. This numerical diffusion process is the cause of major difficulties in representing such dense and thin polluted plumes in numerical models. We propose here, and test in an academic framework, a novel method to solve this problem through the use of an antidiffusive ad"}

Model Dev. Discuss., https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5194\/gmd-2021-68,https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5194\/gmd-2021-68, 2021\nThe model's ability to reproduce the state of the simulated object is always a subject of discussion. A new method for the multivariate assessment of numerical model skills uses K-means algorithm for clustering of model errors. All available data that fall into model domain and simulation period is incorporated into the skill assessment. The clustered errors are used for the spatial and temporal analysis of the model accuracy. The method can be applied to different types of geoscientific models.\nPorosity and permeability prediction through forward stratigraphic simulations using GPM\u2122 and Petrel\u2122: application in shallow marine depositional settings\nDaniel Otoo and David Hodgetts\nThe forward stratigraphic simulation method is used to predict lithofacies, porosity, and permeability in a reservoir model. The objective of using this approach is to enhance subsurface property modelling through geologic realistic 3-D stratigraphic patterns. Results show realistic stratigraphic sequences. Given this, we can derive spatial and geometric data as secondary data to constrain property simulation in a reservoir model. The approach can reduce the uncertainty of property modelling.\nEffects of transient processes for thermal simulations of the Central European Basin\nDenise Degen and Mauro Cacace\nIn this work, we focus on improving the understanding of subsurface processes with respect to interactions with climate dynamics. We present advanced, open-source mathematical methods that enable us to investigate the influence of various model properties on the final outcomes. By relying on our approach, we have been able to showcase their importance in improving our understanding of the subsurface and highlighting the current shortcomings of currently adopted models.\nA note on precision-preserving compression of scientific data\nRostislav Kouznetsov\nResetting of non-significant figures (precision trimming) enables efficient data compression and helps to avoid excessive use of storage space and network bandwidth while having well-constrained distortion to the data. The paper analyses accuracy losses and artifacts caused by trimming methods and by the widely used linear packing method. The paper presents several methods with implementation, evaluation, and illustrations and includes subroutines directly usable in geoscientific models.\nAn N-dimensional Fortran interpolation programme (NterGeo.v2020a) for geophysics sciences \u2013 application to a back-trajectory programme (Backplumes.v2020r1) using CHIMERE or WRF outputs\nBertrand Bessagnet, Laurent Menut, and Maxime Beauchamp\nGeosci.

It can explore N-dimensional meshes, grids or look-up tables. The code accepts irregular but structured grids. Written in Fortran, it is easy to implement in existing codes and very fast and portable. We have compared it with a Python library. Python is convenient but suffers from portability and is sometimes not optimized enough. As an application case, this method is applied to atmospheric sciences.\nInequality-constrained free-surface evolution in a full Stokes ice flow model (evolve_glacier v1.1)\nAnna Wirbel and Alexander Helmut Jarosch\nWe present an open-source numerical tool to simulate the free-surface evolution of gravity-driven flows (e.g. glaciers) constrained by bed topography. No ad hoc post-processing is required to enforce positive ice thickness and mass conservation. We utilise finite elements, define benchmark tests, and showcase glaciological examples. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of the applicability and robustness of different spatial stabilisation and time discretisation methods.\nA fast and efficient MATLAB-based MPM solver: fMPMM-solver v1.1\nIn this work, we present an efficient and fast material point method (MPM) implementation in MATLAB. We first discuss the vectorization strategies to adapt this numerical method to a MATLAB implementation. We report excellent agreement of the solver compared with classical analysis among the MPM community, such as the cantilever beam problem. The solver achieves a performance gain of 28 compared with a classical iterative implementation.\nNecessary conditions for algorithmic tuning of weather prediction models using OpenIFS as an"}

The main conclusions are that the computer algorithms work most efficiently with a suitable cost function, certain forecast length and ensemble size. We expect that our results will facilitate the use of algorithmic methods in the tuning of weather models.\nDevelopment of a submerged aquatic vegetation growth model in the Coupled Ocean\u2013Atmosphere\u2013Wave\u2013Sediment Transport (COAWST v3.4) model\nTarandeep S. Kalra, Neil K. Ganju, and Jeremy M. Testa\nThe paper covers the description of a 3-D open-source model that dynamically couples the biophysical interactions between submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), hydrodynamics (currents, waves), sediment dynamics, and nutrient loading. Based on SAV growth model, SAV can use growth or dieback while contributing and sequestering nutrients from the water column (modifying the biological environment) and subsequently affect the hydrodynamics and sediment transport (modifying the physical environment).\nRetrieving monthly and interannual total-scale pH (pHT) on the East China Sea shelf using an artificial neural network: ANN-pHT-v1\nXiaoshuang Li, Richard Garth James Bellerby, Jianzhong Ge, Philip Wallhead, Jing Liu, and Anqiang Yang\nWe have developed an ANN model to predict pH using 11 cruise datasets from 2013 to 2017, demonstrated its reliability using three cruise datasets during 2018 and applied it to retrieve monthly pH for the period 2000 to 2016 on the East China Sea shelf using the ANN model in combination with input variables from the Changjiang biology Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model. This approach may be a valuable tool for understanding the seasonal variation of pH in poorly observed regions.\nDevelopment of a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme for the NEMO ocean model (3.1)\nChristopher Subich, Pierre Pellerin, Gregory Smith, and Frederic Dupont\nThis work presents a semi-Lagrangian advection module for the NEMO (OPA) ocean model. Semi-Lagrangian advection transports fluid properties (temperature, salinity, velocity) between time steps by following fluid motion and interpolating from upstream locations of fluid parcels. This method is commonly used in atmospheric models to extend time step size, but it has not previously been applied to operational ocean models. Overcoming this required a new approach for solid boundaries (coastlines).\nEfficient multi-scale Gaussian process regression for massive remote sensing data with satGP v0.1.2\nJouni Susiluoto, Alessio Spantini, Heikki Haario, Teemu H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen, and Youssef Marzouk\nWe describe a new computer program that is able produce maps of carbon dioxide or other quantities based on data collected by satellites that orbit the Earth. When working with such data there is often too much data in one area and none in another. The program is able to describe the fields even when data is not available. To be able to do so, new computational methods were developed. The program is also able to describe how uncertain the estimated carbon dioxide or other fields are.\nPDE-NetGen 1.0: from symbolic partial differential equation (PDE) representations of physical processes to trainable neural network representations\nOlivier Pannekoucke and Ronan Fablet\nLearning physics from data using a deep neural network is a challenge that requires an appropriate but unknown network architecture. The package introduced here helps to design an architecture by translating known physical equations into a network, which the experimenter completes to capture unknown physical processes. A test bed is introduced to illustrate how this learning allows us to focus on truly unknown physical processes in the hope of making better use of data and digital resources.\nSimple algorithms to compute meridional overturning and barotropic streamfunctions on unstructured meshes\nDmitry Sidorenko, Sergey Danilov, Nikolay Koldunov, Patrick Scholz, and Qiang Wang\nComputation of barotropic and meridional overturning streamfunctions for models formulated on unstructured meshes is commonly preceded by interpolation to a regular mesh. This operation destroys the original conservation, which can be then be artificially imposed to make the computation possible. An elementary method is proposed that avoids interpolation and preserves conservation in a strict model sense.\nDevelopment of a two-way-coupled ocean\u2013wave model: assessment on a global NEMO(v3.6)\u2013WW3(v6.02) coupled configuration\nXavier Couvelard, Florian"}

This study describes the necessary steps and discusses the various choices made for coupling a wave model and an oceanic model for global-scale applications.\nSurrogate-assisted Bayesian inversion for landscape and basin evolution models\nRohitash Chandra, Danial Azam, Arpit Kapoor, and R. Dietmar M\u00fcller\nForward landscape and sedimentary basin evolution models pose a major challenge in the development of efficient inference and optimization methods. Bayesian inference provides a methodology for estimation and uncertainty quantification of free model parameters. In this paper, we present an application of a surrogate-assisted Bayesian parallel tempering method where that surrogate mimics a landscape evolution model. We use the method for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification.\nTowards an objective assessment of climate multi-model ensembles \u2013 a case study: the Senegalo-Mauritanian upwelling region\nJuliette Mignot, Carlos Mejia, Charles Sorror, Adama Sylla, Michel Cr\u00e9pon, and Sylvie Thiria\nThe most robust representation of climate is usually obtained by averaging a large number of simulations, thereby cancelling individual model errors. Here, we work towards an objective way of selecting the least biased models over a certain region, based on physical parameters. This statistical method based on a neural classifier and multi-correspondence analysis is illustrated here for the Senegalo-Mauritanian region, but it could potentially be developed for any other region or process.\nQuickSampling v1.0: a robust and simplified pixel-based multiple-point simulation approach\nMathieu Gravey and Gr\u00e9goire Mariethoz\nStochastic simulations are key tools to generate complex spatial structures uses as input in geoscientific models. In this paper, we present a new open-source tool that enables to simulate complex structures in a straightforward and efficient manner, based on analogues.

This method can achieve comparable results to previous research using a more than 20 times larger mesh size, which can be used to improve the efficiency in marine ice sheet simulations.\nOn the numerical integration of the Lorenz-96 model, with scalar additive noise, for benchmark twin experiments\nColin Grudzien, Marc Bocquet, and Alberto Carrassi\nAll scales of a dynamical physical process cannot be resolved accurately in a multiscale, geophysical model. The behavior of unresolved scales of motion are often parametrized by a random process to emulate their effects on the dynamically resolved variables, and this results in a random\u2013dynamical model. We study how the choice of a numerical discretization of such a system affects the model forecast and estimation statistics, when the random\u2013dynamical model is unbiased in its parametrization.\nData assimilation of in situ and satellite remote sensing data to 3D hydrodynamic lake models: a case study using Delft3D-FLOW v4.03 and OpenDA v2.4\nTheo Baracchini, Philip Y. Chu, Jonas \u0160ukys, Gian Lieberherr, Stefan Wunderle, Alfred W\u00fcest, and Damien Bouffard\nLake physical processes occur at a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. 3D hydrodynamic lake models are the only information source capable of solving those scales; however, they still need observations to be calibrated and to constrain their uncertainties. The optimal combination of a 3D hydrodynamic model, in situ measurements, and remote sensing observations is achieved through data assimilation. Here we present a complete data assimilation experiment for lakes using open-source tools.\nA one-dimensional model of turbulent flow through \"urban\" canopies (MLUCM v2.0): updates based on large-eddy simulation\nNegin Nazarian, E.

Cotter\nGalerkin finite element discretizations for atmospheric modeling often require the solution of ill-conditioned, saddle point equations which can be efficiently solved using a hybridized method. By extending Firedrake's domain-specific abstraction, we provide a mechanism for the rapid implementation of hybridization methods for a wide class of methods. In this paper, we show that hybridization is an effective alternative to traditional block solvers for simulating geophysical flows.\nA model of Black Sea circulation with strait exchange (2008\u20132018)\nMurat Gunduz, Emin \u00d6zsoy, and Robinson Hordoir\nThe Bosphorus exchange is of critical importance for hydrodynamics and hydroclimatology of the Black Sea. In this study, we report on the development of a medium-resolution circulation model of the Black Sea, making use of surface atmospheric forcing with high space and time resolution, climatic river fluxes and strait exchange, enabled by adding elementary details of strait and coastal topography and seasonal hydrology specified in an artificial box on the Marmara Sea side.\nThe Land Variational Ensemble Data Assimilation Framework: LAVENDAR v1.0.0\nEwan Pinnington, Tristan Quaife, Amos Lawless, Karina Williams, Tim Arkebauer, and Dave Scoby\nGeosci.

However, the method is model agnostic, requires no modification to the underlying code and can be applied to any part of the model. In the example application we improve estimates of maize yield by 74\u2009% by assimilating observations of leaf area, crop height and photosynthesis.\nEvaluation of lossless and lossy algorithms for the compression of scientific datasets in netCDF-4 or HDF5 files\nXavier Delaunay, Aur\u00e9lie Courtois, and Flavien Gouillon\nThis research aimed at finding a compression method suitable for the ground processing of CFOSAT and SWOT satellite datasets. Lossless algorithms did not allow enough compression. That is why we began studying lossy alternatives. This work introduces the digit rounding algorithm which reduces the volume of scientific datasets keeping only the significant digits in each sample value. The number of digits kept is relative to each sample so that both small and high values are similarly preserved.\nAnderson, J., Toohey, D., and Brune, W.: Free radicals within the Antarctic vortex: the role of CFCs in Antarctic ozone loss, Science, 251, 39\u201346, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1126\/science.251.4989.39, 1991.\nAndrews, D.

{"text":"Perverse Environmental Justice (Part II)\nBy Paul Driessen -- June 11, 2015\n\"The real 'criminals' are those who use climate fear-mongering to justify fraudulent science and policies that kill, by denying people access to life-saving fossil fuels.\"\nContrary to global warming hype, cold weather kills 20 times as many people as hot weather, according to a study that analyzed 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries. And contrary to climate models and predictions, recent winters have been long and cold \u2013 a far cry from climate alarmist claims that snow and skiing would soon be a thing of the past.\nIn Britain, many pensioners now ride buses or sit in libraries all day during the winter to stay warm, while others burn used books in stoves, as they are cheaper than coal or wood. Thousands die of hypothermia each winter, because they can no longer afford to heat their homes properly, due to soaring electricity costs under Britain's climate and renewable energy policies.\nIn Germany, Greece and other countries, rising energy costs have caused a surge in illegal tree cutting, as desperate families try to stay warm. Hungry, unemployed families are also poaching wildlife. Loggers are cutting down U.S. forests, destroying wildlife habitats and shipping wood pellets to Europe, to provide fuel for generating electricity under laws that reward the use of \"renewable\" power and prohibit fracking for oil and natural gas. Meanwhile, all over Europe, forests of wind turbines generate unreliable, expensive electricity, while slaughtering millions of its birds and bats.\nFor what climate or environmental benefit are all these sacrifices being made?\nReality: Fossil Fuels Triumphant\nNumerous countries are burning large quantities of coal to generate critically needed electricity. Thus atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will continue to climb, even if the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia end their fossil fuel use, ruin their economies and dramatically lower their living standards. And as always, Earth's climate will continue to change, with or without the aid of all that carbon dioxide.\nJapan is building new coal-fired power plants to replace its nuclear fleet \u2013 and financing coal power in India and Bangladesh. It notes that modern high-efficiency units burn coal with less pollution and fewer carbon dioxide emissions than older plants \u2013 and stresses the importance of helping impoverished countries get reliable, affordable electricity to create jobs, improve living standards and save lives.\nChina, India, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, the Balkans and other countries are also building coal-fueled power plants at a steady clip. And Russia says it will \"comply\" with any new treaty primarily by emphasizing CO2 reductions due to absorption by its vast forests.\nAt this rate, the United States will soon be one of only a few nations that strangle their economies and imperil people's health and welfare in the name of stopping climate change.\nIgnoring Inconvenient Realities\nThe EPA, IPCC, White House and EU deliberately and studiously ignore all these inconvenient realities. They do not want to discuss the countless ways their actions adversely affect people's lives, livelihoods, living standards and life spans.\nIn fact, their deceptions and decisions hurt people to a far greater degree than manmade climate change possibly could, especially when their decrees deny people access to the abundant, reliable, affordable electricity and motor fuels that make modern lives, technologies and living standards possible.\nThat means the entire \"permissible\" discussion of climate change, fossil fuels and renewable energy is incomplete, dishonest, fraudulent, and destructive to people and the environment. And yet, many poor countries still say they intend to sign a new climate treaty in Paris.\nWhy on Earth would they want to do that? Several reasons come to mind.\n(1) Under the proposed treaty, over the coming decades, developed countries will be required to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars in cash \u2026 and hundreds of billions in free technology \u2026 to poor and rapidly developing countries, including China, Brazil, India and Indonesia.\n(2) The United States, Canada, Europe and other developed nations \u2013 FRCs, or Formerly Rich Countries \u2013 will also be required to slash their fossil fuel use, reduce their international competiveness, and hobble their economies, job creation, living standards, health and welfare. Developing countries will be under no such constraints.\n(3) The proposed Paris accord is no longer a climate issue, if it ever was. Christiana Figueres, the UN's chief climate change official, says the IPCC's goal is not to save the world from ecological calamity. It is to rein in or destroy capitalism. The UN's unelected bureaucrats, she says, are undertaking \"probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the global [capitalist] economic development model.\"\nOttmar Edendorfer, another high-ranking IPCC official, put it this way: \"Climate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with environmental protection. The next world climate summit is actually an economy summit, during"}
{"text":" which the distribution of the world's resources will be negotiated.\"\nThis means the summit could give government officials and environmental activists the power to eliminate fossil fuels, control businesses and national economies, and tell families what living standards they will be permitted to enjoy, under climate and \"sustainability\" guidelines. Meanwhile, the ruling elites will live and travel lavishly, \u00e1 la the Soviet nomenklatura or the Capitol in The Hunger Games.\nThis is what today passes for climate morality and environmental justice.\nIn fact, contrary to what Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and others are saying, the real 'deniers' are alarmists, who deny the role of powerful natural forces in climate change.\nThe real 'racketeers' are those who want to destroy the scientific method and silence anyone who challenges their claims. The real 'criminals' are those who use climate fear-mongering to justify fraudulent science and policies that kill, by denying people access to life-saving fossil fuels.\nPeople everywhere need to understand what is actually going on and what is at stake. Countries, states, communities, companies and citizens need to resist and challenge these immoral, harmful, tyrannical and lethal EPA and IPCC assertions and decrees. Otherwise, the steady economic, technological, health and human progress of the past 150 years will come to a grinding halt, sacrificed in the name of \"sustainability,\" \"climate stabilization\" and wealth redistribution.\nPaul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow; author of Eco-Imperialism: Green Power \u2013 Black Death; and coauthor of Cracking Big Green: Saving the World from the Save-the-Earth Money Machine."}
{"text":"As executive sponsor of BNY Mellon's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, president Karen B. Peetz sees the emergence of a new paradigm of CSR leadership. The power and potential for business to contribute solutions to large-scale social and environmental issues is unprecedented. We've excerpted part of her message from this year's CSR Report below. For more of Karen's point of view on the shifting landscape and how the financial services industry can lead the way on deeper CSR engagement, read her full perspective here.\nIn the past year, social and environmental issues have dominated the global arena in an unprecedented way. COP21 and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, highlighted the increasingly urgent and complex nature of the challenges faced by our planet and its people. Climate change, large-scale migration, social instability and cybersecurity further amplify this call to action and are some of the most significant risks worldwide, according to the World Economic Forum's 2016 Risk Report.\nEven more than the scale of these issues, I am impressed by a tremendous shift in approaches to addressing them. It is no longer the sole prerogative of NGOs, governments, civil society and philanthropists. The private sector has a pivotal role. Cross-sector collaboration is a valued and expected norm.\nThere's never been a better time for that shift. Business is in a position to contribute leadership, a strong voice, deliver on its commitments and leverage its resources to provide solutions. We see it in action as business galvanizes around climate change and major brands take on social issues and inequalities in their communities.\nWe at BNY Mellon welcome that shift and call on our industry to step up and engage in CSR at a deeper level.\nTo see more from BNY Mellon about how it's improving lives through investing, follow the hashtag #WeAreInvested on Twitter."}

Self-proclaimed \"summer drummer\" Brian Deodat said much of the same about the other group in so many (more explicit) words, as did the \"number one roadies,\" unofficial band photographers and others passing through the narrow walls of 3A Church St., New Paltz N.Y. for a Thursday night beer.\nSitting inches apart, 10 people shouted over one another, laughing as they tried to recount the almost-fight they had with Slothbear members at a show last summer. Side conversations about other gigs arose in the room that acted as Ghost Mall's stage more than half a dozen times in three months. Someone suddenly dropped a case of beer, and the perpetrator was met by a chorus of curses and laughter as the cans crashed to the ground.\nFor vocalist Pierce Lydon, nights like these with bandmates, close friends and good and bad memories are simply \"enough\" for Ghost Mall members.\n\"[Being in a band] isn't something I hope that I'll get paid a ton of money to do. If I could just have sort of a shitty job and do this too, that'd be more than OK,\" he said. \"Although I have unreal expectations of life, all I really hope to do is play with my favorite bands and have a good time with my friends.\"\nWhile Lydon jokingly claimed Bruce Springsteen came to him in a dream to tell him to form Ghost Mall, Letourneau said the band of SUNY New Paltz students came together by accident. Letourneau and guitarist Cody Torlincasi had collaborated together while attending high school in Farmingdale, Long Island. Lydon showed the pair lyrics for \"Johnny Appleseed\" and they liked what they saw. Drummer James Sutherland was added and the ensemble was complete.\nSix months later, Ghost Mall added four more songs to their set and plays nearly a show a week. Aside from those singing along on the streets of Brooklyn, at New Paltz \"zombie proms\" and at Manhattan clubs, thousands more can hear the band's work on the Web. The musicians have taken full advantage of the advent of social networking Web sites; from Twitter to MySpace to Facebook to blog sites, Ghost Mall's music can be found all over the Internet.\nCurrently, the group has over 21,000 views of their MySpace page and the songs posted were played over 7,000 times. With Facebook messages sent to the masses about show dates and tweets between bandmates and producers, Lydon said the Internet has been good to Ghost Mall.\n\"I don't really know if the MySpace stuff says anything, but I guess that it means people bother to go to our site. I don't know, I guess that counts for something,\" he said. \"I don't think we've really seen the dividend with becoming one of these big, hyped Internet bands, but it's helped us.\"\nTorlincasi said they are also seeing the impact of bloggers on bands like Ghost Mall and that it's interesting to see what others have to say.\n\"It's cool to just have people to write about us,\" he said. \"I think using these Web sites helps to get a buzz out.\"\nThe band is reaching out to Web surfers everywhere in an effort to raise funds for their upcoming tour. Ghost Mall will be on the road from March 12-20 en route to Austin, Texas. Since the four college students cannot put together $1,000 for gas money alone, they decided to raise the funds for tour expenses on kickstarter.com.\nKickstarter, an online funding platform used by musicians, artists, designers, filmmakers, journalists, invent"}

Whether they offer $1 for digital song downloads or $500 for nine awards (including a visit from the band), \"Ghost Mallrats\" were able to help make the group's first tour a reality. Since the Web page entitled \"GHOST MALL TOUR 2010: To Austin and Back Again\" was created on kickstarter.com in November, the group surpass their $1,00o goal. A benefit show was also held in New Paltz on Feb.6.\nGhost Mall is also using the Internet to promote Friendly Neighborhood Records, a label formed in collaboration with members of the Sunshower Orphans and the Wire Hangovers. According to Lydon, work by \"bands that we care about\" will be released digitally and available to the public for downloading at fnrecords.blogspot.com. Songs by John Warren were first posted on Sept. 24. Original tracks by the Wire Hangovers, Moon Trees (Letourneau's side project), Fire to Wood and Ghost Mall themselves soon followed. Songs by Wood Burning Stoves, QUARTERBACKS and Anthony Parks were also posted last December.\nIronically, Torlincasi described Ghost Mall as a \"broke-fi gunk pop\" band, aka a New Paltz pop group with poorly-made recordings. However, Ghost Mall recorded with Kevin \"DJ Teenwolf\" Ross of Ninjasonik in November. The band continues to touch up their currently untitled six-track EP set for release in March 2010.\nIn spite of all the recording efforts Ghost Mall has made in the past few weeks, Letourneau said they look forward to seeing some of the same faces at every live show more than anything else.\n\"Our fan base is basically our friends, and we wouldn't have it any other way,\" he said. \"They know all the words to every song and have just been psyched for us from the beginning.\"\nLydon said this correlates with the chorus of \"Johnny Appleseed,\" which culminates with the line \"basements and best friends get us through this.\" To him, these lyrics screamed by bandmates and showgoers alike publicly put forth what they're all about.\n\"It was our first song but it really still rings true,\" he said. \"I hope that will never stop.\"\nUntil it does, singing \"Moonlight Bay\" while walking arm-in-arm towards Fat Bob's Pizza with a friend tagging behind and cursing Slothbear can be enough.\nPosted in ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT, CULTURETagged #Alex Letourneau #Facebook #Ghost Mall #Julie Mansmann #Kickstarter.com #music #MySpace #Pierce Lydon #Spirits of the Night #SUNY New Paltz students\nJulie Mansmann\nAll Work, Little Play\nThu Feb 25, 2010\nIt's 2 a.m. when SUNY New Paltz senior, Therese Cavalari, finally leaves work.

Every time a member of their group peeks over the embankment to fix the location of the sniper, they are shot.

Newbern, who has been with the company since 1997, identified these core elements as the foundation that launched AeroVironment into the global, small, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) business.\nAccording to Newbern, the innovative spirit has been a distinct characteristic among AeroVironment employees since the company's inception. \"Back in the early days, many employees were aviation enthusiasts in one way or another,\" he stated, \"and some were world champions competing in aircraft modeling events around the world.\nGossamer Condor - The First Of Its Kind\nA human-powered airplane built by Dr. Paul MacCready, Jr.\nDr. Paul MacCready, Jr., had an unorthodox approach to aviation design, one that paid high dividends throughout his lifetime. His philosophy was to design and build for quick iteration, and he is quoted as saying, \"Find a faster way to fail, recover, and try again.\" That methodology certainly worked for the design of the Gossamer Condor, the first successful human-powered aircraft.\nIn 1959, British industrialist Henry Kremer put out a challenge to build a human-powered airplane and attached a substantial monetary prize for the winner. For 18 years, nobody could do it. Dr. MacCready was up for the challenge. Only six months after attempting his aircraft design, a pilot successfully flew the Gossamer Condor. The difference? While others needed a year's worth of effort for each test flight, Dr. MacCready created a plane that he could fly, fix, and fly again in just a few hours.\nAeroVironment Team Collaborates with NASA\/JPL for Mars Helicopter Launch in July\nIt wasn't enough for AeroVironment engineers to design drones for use on Earth - they had their sights set on something even bigger.\nSince 2013, AeroVironment's team of innovative engineers from our MacCready Works laboratory has been working with NASA\/JPL to design and develop the first Mars drone - a helicopter that will be carried by the Mars 2020 rover. Its name is Ingenuity. The rover was designed and built by NASA\/JPL and was recently named Perseverance, or Percy for short. Percy is scheduled to launch in July 2020 and arrive on Mars in early 2021.\nThe Mars helicopter is a small, autonomous rotorcraft that weighs 4 lbs. (1.8 kg). Its purpose is to demonstrate the viability of aerial robots for planetary exploration.\nAeroVironment Helps the Community While Protecting the Environment\nAre you familiar with e-waste?

{"text":"WPP makes industry-leading net zero commitment\nIn a first for the industry, WPP's commitment includes reaching net zero in the emissions generated by the placement of advertising in the media for its clients\nOn Earth Day, WPP announces a new commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2025 and across its entire supply chain by 2030.\nTo deliver net zero emissions from WPP's operations, electricity will be 100% renewably sourced by 2025.\nWithin WPP's supply chain, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of the company's emissions, the two largest sources are the production of advertising content and, most significantly, the placement of that content in media channels from television and press to radio and online.\nWPP is the first in its industry to include media in its net zero commitment.\nMark Read, CEO of WPP, said: \"WPP is the world's largest buyer of advertising space, managing more than $60 billion in media spend on behalf of our clients, and the world's largest producer of advertising content. So we have the opportunity to make a real difference.\n\"By including emissions from the placement of advertising in our net zero commitment \u2013 a first for our industry \u2013 we aim to raise the bar for the whole sector.\n\"Two-thirds of our top clients have committed to set their own science-based reduction targets and we can play an important role in helping them to meet those targets in their operations and across their supply chains.\n\"We look forward to working with all our partners \u2013 many of whom have already made great strides in this area \u2013 to develop standards that will benefit the industry, our clients and our wider communities.\"\nWorking with media owners\nMany media owners are already investing heavily in measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. Through GroupM, WPP's media investment operation, WPP aims to work with its media partners to develop industry-wide standards for measuring and eliminating the carbon emitted from the placement of advertising in the media.\nGroupM is consolidating its existing carbon calculators to allow a single view of emissions across channels in key markets, and make them available to clients at scale. Carbon data will increasingly be integrated into media partner procurement requests, and all media plans provided to clients will be net zero by the end of the decade.\nNet zero production\nThe pandemic has accelerated innovation in virtual production technology and highlighted its ability to reduce the need for expensive and carbon-intensive location shoots. Taking the lessons from this experience, WPP will increase the use of virtual technology, accelerating the shift towards net zero production.\nHogarth, WPP's creative production business, has pioneered \"Sustainably Made\", a unique approach that combines innovative virtual production techniques with industry-leading measurement tools and in-built carbon offset, to allow clients to produce work with a net-zero impact. WPP is also a founding member of AdGreen, a new initiative to remove the negative environmental impacts of production.\nImpact across the advertising sector\nThe Paris Agreement calls for net zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, but in recognition of the scale of the challenge, WPP's commitment will see its emissions fall faster. With an independently assessed annual carbon footprint of 5.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), WPP's net zero commitment will have a significant impact in reducing the emissions associated with the advertising sector.\nBusinesses increasingly recognise the need to set science-based targets for reaching net zero emissions. Given that WPP and its supply chain represent a significant portion of its clients' own carbon footprints, its commitment to reach net zero by 2030 will help ensure clients can meet their own targets. In line with best practice, WPP will submit its emissions reduction targets to the UN-backed Science Based Targets initiative for independent validation.\nThe net zero commitment follows other industry-leading sustainability initiatives from WPP. In 2020 WPP purchased 65% of its electricity from renewable sources, including 100% of electricity bought in the United States and, for the first time, in the UK, Canada and most European markets. In 2019, WPP was the first among its peers to commit to phasing out single-use plastics within its campuses.\nNiken Wresniwiro, WPP\nAbout WPP\nWPP is a creative transformation company. We use the power of creativity to build better futures for our people, planet, clients and communities.\nFor more information, visit www.wpp.com\/netzero"}

We are pleased to be a resource to the Subcommittee in developing a strategy to seek cost-effective solutions.\"\nSustainable transportation has a crucial role in the fight against climate change, with shipping accounting for 2 to 3 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. The International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency responsible for regulating shipping, has set a global target to cut annual emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 from 2008 levels.\n\"The marine industry in the midst of a transition towards low and zero emissions technologies. Electric, digital and connected solutions are already transforming today's shipping, and there will be a variety of solutions to suit different vessel types and operational profiles for reducing marine emissions,\" said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports.\nTestifying at the hearing, Peter Bryn added: \"Policies should focus on setting sustainability targets for shipping, allowing the industry to assemble the best technologies and solutions for enabling emission reduction, and provide support to the marine industry as it meets those targets.\"\nA Congressional hearing is key method by which US Congressional committees collect and analyze information as part of their legislative function. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has jurisdiction over many modes of transportation in the US, including surface and maritime transportation.\nWith more than half of ABB's global revenues derived from technologies that directly address the causes of climate change, ABB has become one of the world's leading enablers of sustainable transportation for all modes, including marine vessels. ABB's proven solutions for sustainable marine transportation are being used around the world. This year, the first all-electric vessels ever built in the US \u2013 the Niagara Falls tour operator Maid of the Mist tour boats \u2013 will start operaiton, powered by ABB's zero-emission technology.\nABB's commitment to combatting climate change includes limiting the environmental impact of its own operations, with the target to reduce its GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2020 from a 2013 baseline. As a company with around 9,000 technologists that is set to invest around $23 billion in innovation between the signing of the Paris Agreement and 2030, ABB therefore urges policymakers to adopt sound climate policies to encourage innovation and create secure investment conditions.\n7th April 2020 0\nLow-flow UV BWT system approved at IMO and USCG\n30th March 2020 0\nNew bilge water separator announced\nPlatform supply vessels go for filtration\/UV BWT\nPCE Magazine\nCATEGORIES Select Category Archive Environmental Feature New Builds News Opinion Ports and Harbours SeaFirst Technology Video Yard News\nDrydock\nPeel House,\nUpper South View,\nFarnham,\nGU9 7JN\ne: info@drydockmagazine.com\nPart of the MPI Group\n\u00a9 Drydock 2019.

{"text":"Nancy B. Grimm studies the interaction of climate variation and change, human activities and ecosystems. Her interdisciplinary research in both urban and stream ecosystems has focused on disturbance, resilience and biogeochemical processes. The Grimm Lab studies how disturbances (such as flooding or drying) affect the structure and processes of desert streams, how chemical elements move through and cycle within both desert streams and cities, the effects of stormwater infrastructure on water and material movement across an urban landscape, and impacts of extreme events on urban social-ecological-technological systems and their infrastructure.\nFrom 1997-2016, Professor Grimm directed the Central Arizona\u2013Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research program, a pioneering interdisciplinary study of the Phoenix metropolitan region. She currently co-directs a Sustainability Research Network focused on urban resilience to weather-related extreme events. She was president and is a fellow of the Ecological Society of America of and is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Society for Freshwater Science.\nShe is an editor of the AGU e-journal, Earth's Future, a past program director for the U.S. National Science Foundation and senior scientist for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and a lead author for two chapters of the U.S. National Climate Assessment, released in 2014.\nBai, X., E.S.

{"text":"\u203a Politics \u203a Global Partnerships Essential to Helping Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island Developing States End Poverty, Tackle Effects of Climate Change\nnepalnewsgazette.com July 10, 2019 Comment Closed Politics\nGlobal partnerships are essential to helping the world's most vulnerable countries eradicate poverty and address climate change, among other global challenges, delegates said today, as the HighLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development held a thematic review focused on the specific needs of such States.\nThe Forum \ufffd held from 9 to 15 July under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council \ufffd reviews progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and pinpoint challenges, ahead of the General Assembly's Sustainable Development Goals Summit at Headquarters on 24 and 25 September.\nAddressing the first panel on the perspectives of small island developing States was Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa, who said progress has been mixed. The Pacific region overall is not on track to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals amid growing vulnerabilities and deepening inequalities, she said, noting: While we have made a good start, it is clearly not enough.\nShe went on to state that Pacific leaders intend to direct more support towards women, youth and persons with disabilities; address gender gaps in employment and decisionmaking; enhance sustainable tourism while conserving the region's rich biodiversity; and tackle noncommunicable diseases, climate change and disasters more effectively. She acknowledged $1.57 billion in assistance from the Green Climate Fund, emphasizing that the Pacific region's challenge is to ensure better use of existing funding.\nBelize's representative, speaking for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the social dimension of sustainable development is often a challenge. As these countries invest in eradicating poverty, a paucity of resources means little is left for social programmes. Small island nations must also deal with limited capacity to gather statistics and measure progress. While there has been a noticeable shift in the global development finance narrative, it is far more challenging to obtain private sector funding for needed social programmes \ufffd an area that requires collective partnership.\nPanellist Rakesh Bhuckory, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mauritius, said that building human capacity is essential. Working with strong partners, Mauritius has built a strong welfare system with a wide range of special protection schemes to narrow social exclusion, he added, noting that the country has also revamped the education system, identified 11,000 families in need of special attention, launched a minimum wage scheme and introduced a negative income tax. As small island developing States share many of the same problems, they can learn from each other, he said.\nDuring the second panel, Fekitamoeloa Katoa 'Utoikamanu, United Nations High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, said robust economic growth in these countries has not translated to poverty eradication. At the current pace, they are unlikely to eliminate poverty by 2030, she said, underscoring the need for both domestic resource mobilization and official development assistance (ODA).\nMalawi's representative, speaking for the Group of Least Developed Countries, warned that global partnerships are under serious strain. Many African countries are suffering under heavy debt while receiving less ODA, he added, emphasizing that multilateralism must be strengthened to support the most vulnerable countries.\nParaguay's representative, speaking for the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, said it is crucial that the six priorities of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries are fully implemented, as they are integral to the 2030 Agenda. Support from development partners is critical for improving infrastructure, increasing connectivity and facing climate change, he said, highlighting the importance of greater access to investments, particularly for energy.\nIn the afternoon, the Forum held a discussion on implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 8 on decent work and economic growth.\nThe HighLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development will reconvene at 9 a.m. on Thursday, 11 July, to continue its work.\nThematic Review I\nThe HighLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development held a thematic review on Perspectives of Small Island Developing States including main findings from midterm review of the SAMOA Pathway. Moderated by Emele Duituturaga, former Executive Director, Pacific Islands Association of NonGovernmental Organizations, it featured a keynote address by Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Natural Resources and the Environment of Samoa.\nMaking presentations were Pat Breen, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, European Union Digital Single Market and Data Protection of Ireland; Douglass Slater, Assistant SecretaryGeneral for Human and Social Development of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat; Yvonne Hyde, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Economic Development and Petroleum of Belize; and Rakesh Bhuckory, Minister Counsellor, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade of Mauritius.\nStacy RichardsKennedy, Director,"}
{"text":" Office of Development, University of the West Indies, Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago; and Willy Missack, Pacific Climate Change Collaboration, Influencing and Learning Project Manager at the Vanuatu Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Humanitarian Team Coordinator at Oxfam in Vanuatu were lead discussants.\nMs. MATAAFA, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said that, since 2015, member States of that regional organization have integrated the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SAMOA Pathway, Paris Agreement on climate change and other global instruments into their policymaking frameworks. Priority attention is going towards the empowerment and inclusion of vulnerable groups, including women and persons with disabilities, as well as improved access to free education and increased spending on social protection. Greater returns from tourism, fisheries and remittances have contributed to economic growth, alongside significant progress in management and conservation.\nHowever, progress between Pacific countries and subgroups has been mixed, she said, and the region overall is not on track to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals amid growing vulnerabilities and deepening inequalities. Sea levels are more than 50 per cent above the global average, coral reefs are dying and cyclones, flood and drought have increased in intensity and cost. Pockets of populations in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Kiribati have already been displaced due to encroaching seas, as well as in Fiji due to cyclone devastation. Wastegeneration, meanwhile, is outpacing the capacity of Pacific nations to deal with it. Economic growth has been inequitable, with one in four Pacific islanders living below national poverty lines and unemployment high, particularly among women and young people. About 1 in 10 people live with some form of disability and too many Pacific island women are victims of violence. The high incidence of noncommunicable diseases is another matter of grave concern.\nWhile we have made a good start, it is clearly not enough, she said, underscoring the commitment of Pacific leaders to target more support for women, youth and persons with disabilities; address gender gaps in employment and decisionmaking; enhance sustainable tourism while also conserving the region's rich biodiversity; and tackle noncommunicable diseases, climate change and disasters more effectively. Acknowledging $1.57 billion in assistance from the Green Climate Fund, she said the challenge for the Pacific region is to ensure better use of existing funding; strengthen capacities, institutions and partnerships; and increase investment in statistical systems. She went on to share several lessons for small island developing States and their development partners, including on the need for capacity, systems and financing to implement plans and policies and to account for results.\nMs. DUITUTURAGA, noting that it is unusual for a representative of civil society to moderate an interactive discussion at the United Nations, said the dialogue would focus on ways in which small island developing States can best respond to social development challenges, the types of policies and programmes to address social inclusion and inequality, and the role that development partners can play.\nMr. BREEN, recalling an Irish expression that translates as the road is shorter when we travel it together, said objectives can only be achieved by working together with an integrated approach to all targets. Emphasizing that building cooperation is a longterm effort, he said Ireland is committed to increasing its support for small island developing States as they deal with the effects of climate change and protect the oceans, as their path to inclusive growth requires access to greater policy support and advice. At the recent annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Fiji, Ireland announced the creation of a singledonor trust fund for climate change mitigation and disaster resilience, with partner States participating in consultations. As a small island developing State itself, Ireland knows that cooperation with similar countries makes sense, he said, pointing to the potential of tourism and the economic power of diasporas.\nMs. HYDE, describing her country as a coastal small island developing State, said its national development strategy places a heavy emphasis on sustainable growth and such critical success factors as optimal income and investment, social protection, environment, governance and citizens' security \ufffd all of which link to one or more of the Goals. Belize is investing heavily in education, she said, building preschools in rural areas, making primary education more studentoriented and emphasizing technology and elearning at the secondary and tertiary levels.\nMr. BHUCKORY, stressing the need to get priorities right, said building human capacity is essential for Mauritius. Working with strong partners to make a difference is critical. Mauritius has built a strong welfare system with a wide range of special protection schemes to narrow social exclusion, but with 10 per cent of the population still living in relative poverty, the Government is introducing a host of novel measures. It has also revamped the education system, identified 11,000 families in need of special attention, launched a minimum wage scheme and introduced a negative income tax. Noting that small island developing States share many of the same problems, he emphasized their need to learn from each other and to exchange experiences.\nMr. SL"}
{"text":"ATER said CARICOM member States are investing heavily in human development with a regional human resources strategy that meets the needs of the twentyfirst century. The aim is to invest more in technological and vocational knowledge to promote entrepreneurship and economic investment. He also drew attention to the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, which is being extended to Latin America, and the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism. He stressed the importance of empowering small island developing States to participate more effectively in the Green Climate and Global Environment Fund, while also recommending more national and regional projects of indigenous derivation.\nMs. RICHARDSKENNEDY underscored the unique role that universities can play in advancing the 2030 Agenda and noted that the University of the West Indies has been selected to lead a global consortium addressing Goal 13 on climate action. Noting that the Caribbean region has the lowest tertiary enrolment in the Western Hemisphere, she said that situation, combined with high youth unemployment, represents a longterm threat to development. She went on to describe the University's efforts to expand access to online learning and its establishment of a campus in Antigua and Barbuda.\nMr. MISSACK said local ownership and commitment is at the heart of everything the Forum is discussing today. If international agendas are to deliver on their promises, they must become reality at the village and neighbourhood levels. That often begins with youth, he said, adding that empowering young people to create change is key to building a sense of ownership. He underscored the value of holistic educational processes that strengthen such qualities as respect, humility and truthfulness while also building intellectual capacities.\nIn the ensuing discussion, the representative of Belize, speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, said that, for island countries, implementing the social dimension of sustainable development is a growing challenge. As they invest in eradicating poverty and inequality, a paucity of resources means little is left for social programmes. Small island developing States must also deal with limited capacity to gather statistics and measure progress. While there has been a noticeable shift in the global development finance narrative, it is far more challenging to obtain private sector funding for the social dimension of sustainability \ufffd an area that requires partnership within the international community.\nThe representative of Norway said partnerships are more important than ever for addressing such crucial issues as climate change. Small island developing States generate the lowest carbon emissions yet suffer disproportionately from their effects. Describing Norway as a reliable development partner, she appealed for a unified voice at the Climate Action Summit and at the twentyfifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe representative of Tonga said public sector reform is a big challenge for his country's new democratically elected Government. He agreed with need for integrated partnerships for achieving the Goals, adding, however, that a lack of networks is a major challenge. It is essential, he added, for the United Nations system to take another look at regionalism and multilateralism in terms of reporting and monitoring.\nThe representative of the Dominican Republic, stressing the need to take advantage of technology advances, said the fourth technological revolution should not lead to social exclusion. Challenges must be tackled across the board with fresh practices that incorporate numerous stakeholders.\nThe representative of Haiti, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), said Caribbean small island developing States are grappling with unique challenges even as they find themselves in the unenviable position of being ranked as middleincome countries. Mainstreaming the multidimensional nature of development must look beyond per capita gross domestic product (GDP), he said, calling for the establishment of a global architecture for cooperation.\nThe representative of Fiji underscored the need to reform grant financing for small island developing States, which for their part must improve their capability to implement programmes on a larger scale. He also called for a seachange in how the United Nations system delivers for small island developing States.\nThe representative of the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States emphasized the importance of partnerships, pointing to the Office's efforts in that regard.\nThe representative of Palau said that, with some 38 small island developing States in three regions around the world, there can be no onesizefitsall approach to the challenges they face. Also emphasizing the value of partnerships, she said deploying even minimal resources can have a transformative impact on small island nations.\nMs. HYDE replied that development financing, including loans and grants, often comes with conditions that are so bureaucratic and burdensome that small island developing States have difficulty meeting their obligations. She also underscored the multiple dimensions of vulnerability, which tend to be addressed in a piecemeal fashion.\nMr. SLATER said he hoped developed countries participating today will note the importance of technology transfers to small island developing States. He also stressed the crosscutting nature of genderrelated issues, especially violence against women. We must continue to say no to misogyny, while also addressing the marginalization of boys, he added.\n"}
{"text":"Mr. BREEN, agreeing on the need for more work related to partnerships, said tourism is one area that should be looked at seriously. Tourism was important for Ireland's economic recovery and it can benefit other small island countries, as well. He went on to note that technological innovation and digitalization can lift many barriers to global markets, including the virtual labour market.\nMr. BHUCKORY said small island developing States are coming up with innovative solutions to their challenges \ufffd but often then operate in silos within their own regions. They can learn much from each other about best practices, he said, suggesting that partnership among these countries be addressed as part of the midterm review of the SAMOA Pathway.\nAlso participating in the discussion were representatives of Jamaica and the Bahamas, as well as of the women's major group and the stakeholder group of persons with disabilities.\nMARIAFRANCESCA SPATOLISANO, Assistant SecretaryGeneral for Policy Coordination and InterAgency Affairs, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, made closing remarks.\nThematic Review II\nThe Council then held a thematic review titled Perspectives of Least Developed Countries and Landlocked Developing Countries. Moderated by Hope Muli, Regional Project Manager, Opening Contracting, Hivos, it featured presentations by Jerry Tardieu, Congressman, PetionVille, Haiti; Saad Alfarargi, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to development; Fekitamoeloa Katoa 'Utoikamanu, United Nations High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States; and Ricardo FuentesNieva, Executive Director of Oxfam Mexico. Serving as lead discussants were Doma Tshering (Bhutan), cofacilitator of political declaration of the midterm review of the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries, and Richard Ssewakiryanga, CoChair for the CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness, and immediate past Presiding Officer of the African Union \ufffd Economic and Social Cultural Council.\nMs. MULI invited participants to examine the challenges to inclusiveness and equality in least developed countries and how can they be addressed, as well as the changes that are needed in international rules and institutions to support least developed countries and landlocked developing countries in achieving greater inclusion and equality.\nMr. TARDIEU said most least developed countries face challenges in building institutional resilience, stressing the need for wellcrafted policy by Parliament. Access to credits is vital for fostering small and midsize businesses in broader efforts to leave no one behind. Stressing the importance of development financing, he said Government, the private sector, Parliament and civil society are all key institutional actors in fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. It is also critical to include diasporas in the national development strategy.\nMr. ALFARARGI pointed out that the 2030 Agenda, Sendai Framework on disaster reduction and the Addis Abba Action Agenda all support the right to development. That right is about placing people at the centre of development and about achieving real human development. In the five regional consultations, he found that the right to development must be inclusive and comprehensive.\nMs. 'UTOIKAMANU pointed out that, while least developed countries and landlocked developing countries have achieved 5 per cent economic growth in recent years, the gains have not translated into poverty eradication. At the current pace, these nations are unlikely to end poverty by 2030. Over the past 47 years, only five nations have graduated from these categories, and 12 are now at various stages of graduation. Least developed countries and landlocked developing countries deal with inequality, a lack of access to services and technology, high exposure to disasters and high transit costs. They are seeking to diversify their economies, but still not receiving enough support from development partners. While domestic resources must be mobilized, partners must also fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) commitments. The establishment of the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries is a remarkable achievement as it supports capacitybuilding. The international community should invest in it, she urged, also stressing that the International ThinkTank for Landlocked Developing Countries will help strengthen the analytical capacities of the world's 32 poorest landlocked nations in economic growth and poverty reduction.\nMr. FUENTESNIEVA said that inclusiveness is a political choice and can be achieved through public policies. Calling taxation a social contract and key element of inclusiveness and equality, he said the gap between men and women must be addressed. While public policies are important, it is also crucial to recognize local contexts, he said, underscoring more importantly that local civil society needs support.\nMs. TSHERING underscored the need for resources to implement the Vienna Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals. Support for capacitybuilding, domestic resource mobilization, export diversification and regional integration are also essential. Least developed countries and land"}
{"text":"locked developing nations must attract foreign direct investment, he said, as well as maintain digital connectivity and take part in regional value chains. Reliable data at the national level is also essential, he added, noting that women and girls must be recognized as drivers and multipliers of development.\nMr. SSEWAKIRYANGA said graduation from least developed country and landlocked developing country status must be viewed differently. These decisions are not about metrics, he assured, but, rather, about people. Although these countries have seen impressive economic gains, they also see alarming poverty rates and inequality is rising. Moreover, least developed countries are home to 19 per cent of the world's young people and graduation criteria must consider these elements.\nThe representative of Malawi, speaking on behalf of the least developed countries, expressed concern about slowing growth, persistently high rates of extreme poverty and global partnerships under serious strain. In addition, lower levels of ODA are provided to Africa, where many countries carry high debt. He highlighted the need to increase privatesector investment and further integrate into the global trade system. Domestic resource mobilization must increase, while the opportunities presented by new frontier technologies must be leveraged.\nThe representative of Paraguay, speaking on behalf of the 32 landlocked developing countries, said the national assessments and the three regional reviews clearly indicate that not enough progress has been made in fulfilling the priorities of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the decade 20142024, or the Sustainable Development Goals. To achieve the Goals, it is crucial that the Programme of Action's six priorities are fully implemented, as this is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. Support from development partners is needed to improve infrastructure, increase connectivity and face the challenges of climate change, he said, highlighting the importance of greater investments in the areas of energy, and information and communication technology.\nThe representative of the European Union said the bloc is the largest provider of ODA, reiterating its offer of financial support and noting that such aid has increased by Euros 1 billion since 2016. Trade can make an important contribution to poverty eradication in these countries, he said, noting that the bloc opened its market for exports from least developed countries and that these measures are essential for building their resilience.\nThe representative of Nepal, a least developed and landlocked developing country, intends to graduate from these categories by 2021, but the transition must be smooth and irreversible. There will be upfront costs, he stressed, calling for support from development partners and the international community.\nThe representative of Ethiopia said landlock developing countries deserve special attention. Development partners must keep and enhance their commitments, he said, underscoring the need for technical assistance in capacity building and for industrialization policies.\nThe representative of Zambia said lack of access to territorial waters, high transit costs, poor access to infrastructure, energy, water and transport all make people in these nations vulnerable, she said, noting that her country incorporated the Vienna Programme of Action into its national plan.\nThe representative of Turkey said challenges facing least developed countries cannot be addressed only through national actions. Global partnerships are needed. Stressing that Turkey provided $8.2 billion in ODA in 2017, a leading country, she said her delegation will host a side event on the Technology Bank.\nThe representative of the AsiaPacific Regional CSO Mechanism stressed the need to end the caste system and discrimination in Nepal. Inequality is increasing in her region, she said, noting that support for the regional approach, including means of implementation, is needed\nThe representative of the women's major group called for revolutionary change to empower women, who are often denied basic human rights.\nThe representative of indigenous peoples major group described how human rights of indigenous peoples are violated across the world, citing the killing of indigenous leaders in Guatemala and the arrest of those protesting megainfrastructure projects affecting their land in Kenya.\nMr. TARDIEU, responding to those comments, said Haiti has transitioned from an agricultural economy into a remittance economy, with $2.5 billion received from diasporas that accounts for 30 per cent of gross domestic product.\nMr. ALFARARGI said all relevant stakeholders must be included in all domestic planning, programming and evaluation processes. The international community must secure budgets for the effective participation of these stakeholders.\nMs. 'UTOIKAMANU, underscoring the important role of Parliament, also urged support for countries graduating from least developed country and landlocked, developing country status.\nMr. FUENTESNIEVA called for expanding the space for civil society, with ODA supporting such efforts.\nMr. SSEWAKIRYANGA said the positive impact of migration must be discussed, along with the role of diasporas.\nThe representative of Morocco explained how his country is strengthening trade with other African countries, opening its market to exports from least developed nations and signing trade and tariff agreements with several African countries.\nThe representative of Paraguay said 2019 is an important year as the midterm review will take"}

The lagged endogenous model (a dynamic log-linear model that we used) is estimated using two distinctive approaches: single-equation one with OLS and simultaneous-equations with GMM. The results of both methods unanimously show that the maritime transportation elasticities of both environmental pollution and economic growth are low and positive just like the economic growth elasticities of environmental pollution. Therefore, environmental pollution has a positive relationship with the maritime transportation and economic growth, confirming the Pollution Haven Hypothesis; and the economic growth responds to the maritime transportation slightly and slowly. The policy-makers are advised to improve the environmentally-polluting infrastructure of the maritime transportation rather than restricting the growth of this sector.\nKeywords: Maritime Transportation\nCO2 Emissions.

{"text":"In a few weeks, world leaders will gather in Paris to boast about their bold stance on climate change. But strip away the considerable nonsense surrounding this topic, and a few stark facts remain. Back in 1992 \u2013 well before science had anything conclusive to say about humanity's impact on the climate \u2013 the United Nations persuaded countries to sign an international treaty aimed at saving the planet from 'dangerous' human-emitted greenhouse gases.\nLet me repeat that. The treaty came first.\nNow let's meet a UN entity called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We're told it's a 'scientific body.' But that's a cynical ploy. The IPCC's job is to provide scientific cover for the political convictions that spawned the treaty. As I explain here, scientists aren't in charge at the IPCC. Reports written by scientists get re-written by bureaucrats and diplomats. These reports are then cited by governments as evidence that carbon taxes, job-killing regulations, and trillions in climate expenditures are necessary. IPCC science says so.\nIn 2011, my book-length expos\u00e9 of the IPCC appeared. I demonstrate that the IPCC is an unprofessional, untrustworthy organization that saw no need for a conflict-of-interest policy for two entire decades. I point out that, rather than recruiting disinterested experts from unrelated fields to evaluate climate models, the IPCC has repeatedly invited people whose careers depend on these tools to conduct such evaluations. I tell the story of the hurricane expert who quit in disgust, after discovering firsthand that politics trumps scientific evidence at the IPCC.\nA few weeks ago, a Paris-based company specializing in mathematical modelling released a 195-page white paper. Absolutely free of charge, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Calcul Math\u00e9matique (SCM) provides an alternative perspective on the same questions the IPCC has spent 27 years examining.\nOne third of this white paper is devoted to the IPCC, and 'scathing' doesn't begin to describe that section. The IPCC's methodology, says the SCM, is \"highly biased\" and \"arbitrary.\" IPCC statements and conclusions are dismissed as being entirely meaningless, logically flawed, totally absurd, intellectually dishonest, and in violation of scientific norms.\nIn reality, evidence for human influence has not grown \u2013 far from it. The studies are all contradictory, showing that we do not understand anything about the phenomena in question. The IPCC is implying that we have scientific certainties and that these certainties point to a single culprit: humankind. That is just being dishonest.\nIn 2010, the InterAcademy Council report appeared. In 2011, my expos\u00e9 was published. Now, in 2015, the SCM has released its white paper. Each of these examinations of the IPCC highlights significant concerns. The nature of these concerns is such that, in a sane universe, government officials preparing for Paris should be having minor heart attacks.\nBut the message doesn't penetrate. The notion that IPCC reports are unreliable simply doesn't compute. It's as though our leaders, the world over, have decided to close their eyes and block their ears. That sound you hear is my book being swept under the rug.\nThe climate change emperor is naked, folks. Strip away the pseudoscience and you find one thing: politics. The political philosophy striving for ascendance here is one that believes human lives need to be constrained, via international treaties, for the sake of Mother Gaia.\nThis entry was posted on November 11, 2015 by Donna Laframboise in climate bible, IPCC and tagged Geoffrey Lean, InterAcademy Council, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Paris 2015, UNFCC."}

They can still believe that Americans embody exceptionalism, ingenuity, a can-do attitude, and tolerance for others.\nSome are embracing falsehoods for convenience sake, because they think it will benefit them to turn a blind eye. Others just don't want to believe that certain issues are going to impact them.\nA prime example of this syndrome is the dismissal of environmental issues. The clock is ticking, and it may no longer be in someone else's backyard.\nConsider the proposed budget cuts to the EPA. President Trump and his team are pushing to diminish the agency by one-third. In dollars, that means a reduction from 8.1 billion to 5.7 billion. As far as jobs, the goal is to slice away one-fifth of all employees, or 3,200 positions.\nI prefer to look at those who will be at a loss without the oversight of the dedicated workers at the EPA.\nAt the top of the list are people suffering from environmental inequality in a systemic fashion. They depend on the office of Environmental Justice to level the playing field when they are up against big businesses who pollute, and are only concerned with the bottom line of their profits.\nHow about the parents of children with asthma? They may still be able to check the EPA website to get support on how to help formulate an action plan for their kids, but what about the on-the-ground realities?\nHow will these revisions impact youngsters who live in Los Angeles or the Bronx \u2013 where smog and particle pollution are high and will only get worse. Or pregnant mothers? Studies have shown that fetal exposure to air pollution results in brain development impacts.\nPair this initiative with the efforts to end the Clean Power Plan, deplete funds for the Superfund program (commonly in economically depressed locations), and the 50 percent reduction of the Office of Research and Development \u2013 and you have a recipe for a mess.\nSlated for elimination are clean-ups of areas off the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes. Even the Energy Star program, which helps consumers choose the best products for their homes in terms of energy efficiency, is on the block.\nThe disconnect comes with the premise that the state is going to pick up all the slack \u2013 and the tab.\nFor now, it may look like a simple economic issue to those who don't recognize the looming problems ahead. But these can become catastrophic personal and planetary problems. Just ask the mother who experienced the impacts of methane from the Porter Ranch leak. Or those whose homes were decimated by Hurricane Sandy.\nThink of the horror that Hurricane Irene wreaked on Vermont when her raging waters dislodged caskets from a Rochester cemetery. What will happen to the people of Port Arthur, and all the other vulnerable communities inhabited by people of color, indigenous tribes, and low-income people?\nScott Pruitt doesn't seem to care about facts. Clearly, neither does President Trump. For this administration, facts don't matter. For the rest of us, they do."}

Rosen closely examines some of the assertions and assumptions made by geoengineering proponents. The complexities of how aerosols would affect climate and ecosystems are not as straightforward or predictable as they are sometimes presented, and merit close examination.\nby Dr. Richard A. Rosen\nWhat good are climate change models for estimating the impact of aerosols?\nFirst, one might ask what good are climate change models at all? This is a perfectly reasonable question to ask given how difficult it is to accurately predict the weather over a period of just a few weeks. And since the climate is just average weather over longer periods of time such as multi-year averages, one might wonder how climate scientists can model the relatively small changes in annual average temperatures or precipitation that can be attributed to human intervention in the climate-earth system. The answer is \u2013 not very well.\nThere are several dozen fairly well-known climate models the results of which appear in the literature on climate change on a regular basis. When these models are run for the same basic scenarios, such as a scenario representing a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, unfortunately the models get very different results. The projected equilibrium temperature increase for such a scenario in the long run differs by approximately a factor of three, from about 1.8-5.4 degrees C, in recent analyses, or from about 1.5-4.5 degrees C in the past. From the perspective of a physicist such as myself, this is a very large difference. Similarly, model projections of regional precipitation, ice melting rates, and sea level rise also differ substantially. However, given how complex the climate\/earth system is, these differences are inevitable.\nYet, if we just look at the historical record for the annual average temperature of the earth (both on land and over the oceans) we see a clear pattern of very slow increases from the early twentieth century to the late 1970s, and then fairly rapid but fluctuating increases from then until now. Relative to the average annual global temperatures in the 19th century, we find the increase by 2020 to be about 1.2 degrees C, or 2.2 degrees F. There is generally a greater increase in higher latitudes and less near the equator, and more over land than the oceans. That temperature trend line representing the impact of humans on the climate is, then, crystal clear, so we do not need any fancy statistical tools or computer models to tell us that it exists.\nThat steady increase in average global temperature can also be compared to the very steady increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the most important greenhouse gas that leads to climate change. In fact, we find that the increase in temperature closely parallels the increase in CO2 emissions from 280 ppm in the 19th century to 415 ppm now, with some recent acceleration, as one would expect from the physics of climate change. Historical measures also find that the total amount of precipitation is also increasing, ocean water temperatures are rising, sea and glacial ice is melting, and sea level is steadily rising. Thus, again, complex computer-based climate change models are not needed to tell us that climate change is occurring, and what is causing it to occur. That is simple undisputed physics, and the rate at which it is occurring from the late 1970s until today is also quite clear.\nWe also know from the historical record that when there have been large volcanic eruptions, the small particulates and the chemical aerosols that have been ejected into the upper atmosphere have caused the earth's average temperature to cool slightly for a couple of years. Again, we do not need complex climate models to tell us that this can happen. However, when some climate researchers have raised the question as to whether chemical aerosols could be purposely injected into the atmosphere to cool the earth enough to significantly offset climate change, scientists have attempted to address that question via the use of climate models, which have already incorporated the existing quantities of aerosols in the atmosphere when calculating climate change. The research question became, then, how many tons of aerosols and what kind would have to be injected into the upper atmosphere and where, to offset a significant amount of climate change, both temperature and precipitation changes?\nWhat is the problem with attempting to answer these questions about the potential impact of aerosols on the climate using climate\/earth system models?\nThe first problem is, as we noted above, that different climate models yield very different results even for average global temperature changes. The results for regional temperature changes vary even more between models, as do the changes in regional precipitation rates. Because we do not even know which climate models are best for forecasting changes in temperature"}
{"text":" and precipitation, it is even more challenging to know which models are best for calculating the impact of purposely adding aerosols to the atmosphere on temperature and precipitation patterns. In terms of physics theory, it is relatively easy to determine how CO2, water vapor, and other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) absorb and re-radiate the sunlight falling on the earth's atmosphere in a local area with clear skies as that sunlight travels from outer space to the earth's surface.\nOnce sunlight warms the air, land, ice, and water those bodies radiate energy in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (mostly visible and infra-red light) back out towards outer space in all directions, and down to earth. However, when these beams of light of many different frequencies travel up and down from outer space to the surface of the earth, they also interact with clouds, ice, vegetation of many types, different types of land, and human settlements around the world. Sometimes clouds absorb the light hitting them and heat up, and sometimes the clouds reflect the radiation back into outer space, or back down to the earth. Again, remember that all gaseous molecules and solid surfaces reflect light in all directions, not just up and down with respect to the earth's surface, and to differing degrees, depending on the frequencies of the spectral lines involved. The aerosols themselves, such as sulfates (H2SO4), have very complex properties which make it difficult to know to what extent they will reflect or absorb light, and at which frequencies, and in which directions. Therefore, the climate\/earth models are extremely complex prior to even considering the effects of aerosols in the atmosphere, and if the impact of large amounts of different kinds of aerosols need to be included, the models get even more complex.\nIn fact, the underlying physics of all these interactions between molecules of many types and radiation across the ultra-violet, visible, and infra-red spectrum is so complex, even though well-known, that climate models cannot actually use the correct physics equations to calculate the interactions and their impact on the earth. The models necessarily use various kinds of approximate equations the solutions to which can be much more readily calculated in a finite period of time on a computer, so that multi-year calculations can be made in order to assess climate change over decades. One reason, then, that different climate models get very different results is that they use different approximations for different physical effects based on judgements made by the different model developers. One effect not mentioned above is that more aerosols tend to create more clouds, but climate models are notoriously poor at \"knowing\" how and when to create clouds with or without aerosols present. This is one reason why it is difficult for climate models to accurately predict precipitation amounts from the clouds, in part because climate models cannot produce individual storms which cause precipitation.\nCan we trust the results of scientific research on aerosol impacts on climate change using climate models?\nI think that the safest way to proceed through the masses of scientific literature on climate change and, in particular, studies on the impact of adding aerosols on climate change is to interpret the published results as merely suggestive of what might actually happen in whatever scenario is being analyzed. No one knows to any reasonable degree of accuracy what will actually happen in a given scenario, for example how more aerosols will affect regional air temperatures, ice or land temperatures, vegetation growth, ocean temperatures, or precipitation patterns. The latter are the least likely to be knowable, since they are not very accurately calculated by climate models even without taking the impacts of aerosols into account.\nBut even IPCC reports point out that it is extremely unlikely that aerosol impacts from adding aerosols regularly to the atmosphere could possibly replicate the regional patterns of climate change so that climate change could be offset everywhere, even with regard to only temperature changes. Yet, some researchers who focus on aerosol impacts seem to claim that there could be a very precise offsetting effect. There are some obvious simple physical reasons that support the conclusion that fairly precise offsetting would not be possible. The clearest example is that when the sun does not shine on the earth's surface, either at night anywhere, or in winter for months at a time in the polar regions, aerosols have no light source that they can reflect back into space in order to cool the earth's surface. Thus, the presence of more and more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the future will cause the warming of such regions at least half the hours of the year, in different patterns and degrees, depending on the latitude of the region under consideration. This warming will occur whether or not more aerosols are injected into the upper atmosphere so the added aerosols could not offset this warming. At the very least, then, the average difference between the low temperature for the day and the high temperature for the day in most regions of the world will decrease because aerosols are likely to cool the high daily temperatures somewhat, but would not reduce the low temperatures. This reduction in the difference between"}

This change could also affect human comfort because people without air conditioning need cool nighttime temperatures to recover from daytime heat in the summer. Yet, aerosols will not cool nighttime temperatures as greenhouse gas-induced warming makes summers ever hotter at night.\nIn conclusion, when one reads research articles that seem to imply that the regular injection of aerosols into the atmosphere could at least offset the temperature impacts of climate change, please read more carefully to see if the article only describes offsetting average global temperatures on an annual basis, or whether it covers the average changes that affect human beings and ecosystems on a daily and seasonal basis.

{"text":"Indonesia's 1999\u20132004 decentralization reforms created opportunities for land-use planning that reflected local conditions and local people's needs. We report on seven years of work in the District of Malinau in Indonesian Borneo that attempted to reconnect government land-use plans to local people's values, priorities, and practices. Four principles are proposed to support more interactive planning between government and local land users: Support local groups to make their local knowledge, experience, and aspirations more visible in formal land-use planning and decision making; create channels of communication, feedback, and transparency to support the adaptive capacities and accountability of district leadership and institutions; use system frameworks to understand the drivers of change and resulting scenarios and trade-offs; and link analysis and intervention across multiple levels, from the local land user to the district and national levels. We describe the application of these principles in Malinau and the resulting challenges.\nAlthough spatial plans are a central feature of forest land-use policy in Indonesia, they have had little connection to the values, priorities, and practices of local peoples, especially in remote forest areas (Murdiono 1998, S\u00e8ve 1999, Jepson et al. 2002). Land-use planning in Indonesia has had a history of producing centrally driven, poorly implemented plans. Meanwhile, Indonesia's forest estate continues to be severely degraded (Jepson et al. 2002), and local communities lack development opportunities (Colfer and Resosudarmo 2002, Moeliono et al. 2007).\nIn this paper, we analyze efforts to make spatial planning in Indonesia's forest areas more relevant to local conditions and land users. We use the example of a land-use planning project in the District of Malinau in East Kalimantan Province, Indonesian Borneo. The project took place from 1998 to 2005 when interest in more locally responsive government was high because of recent decentralization reforms.\nThe Malinau project used an alternative approach to land-use planning that draws from adaptive management, systems theory, and multistakeholder principles. Planning in this approach shifted from being a preparatory, document-focused effort to a set of decision tools and processes that enabled the exchange of information, learning, and adjustments among government and local land users and managers in pursuit of a common vision. We provide examples of how the approach was tested and explain the difficulties of institutionalizing these principles during a period of policy transition. We conclude with some views about how to overcome the problems of planning in uncertain and complex environments.\nRural land-use planning in Indonesia has evolved through three distinct phases that reflect more decentralized decision making: techno-rationalism, regional development, and district-driven planning.\nIn 1982, a first phase of national land-use planning was initiated by the Ministry of Home Affairs through legal instructions to the Ministry of Forestry (MOF) to create Consensus-Based Forest Land Use Planning via Tata Guna Hutan Kesepakatan (TGHK) - No. 26\/1982, Surat Edaran Menteri Dalam Negeri No. 522.12\/4275\/Agr., 1982. In 1984 MOF produced TGHK maps, usually 1:500,000, that classified forest land functions as (1) protection forest, i.e., for watershed protection; (2) conservation forest in the form of national parks and other protected areas; (3) limited production forest, in which timber harvesting needs protective measures to avoid soil erosion; (4) production forest for timber harvesting; and (5) conversion forest for conversion to agriculture, plantation crops, settlements, or other uses (S\u00e8ve 1999:8). The MOF's provincial representative prepared TGHK maps for each province (Jepson 2002). Much of the designation was done with little regard for conditions on the ground.\nA subsequent national mapping effort, the 1987\u20131990 Regional Physical Planning Project for Transmigration (RePPProT), which was a project of the UK's Department for International Development (then the Overseas Development Administration), aimed for more reliable planning information. The project produced maps that rationalized existing TGHK maps with newly proposed land-use zones, including databases on development and reforestation areas. Despite ongoing inaccuracies, the resulting \"consensus TGHK\" maps (1:250,000) became the country's standard and most often used base maps (Jepson et al. 2002). In the early 1990s, the Second Land Resources Evaluation and Planning furthered these efforts by producing digitized maps.\nA second phase of land-use planning began with Indonesia's basic law of spatial planning, Act No. 24\/1992, and the new involvement of the National Development Planning Board. This phase initiated the integration of land allocation with intersectoral development planning. The 1992 law decentralized spatial planning to the provincial, and later, district planning boards.\nStarting in 1997, MOF was to produce new \"integrated maps\" or peta paduserasai that rationalized"}
{"text":" the TGHK maps with the spatial plans of the new provincial and district planning agencies. These plans were known as Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah Propinsi\/Kabupaten or RTRWP\/B (S\u00e8ve 1999, Jepson et al. 2002). The RTRWP\/B were to include administrative boundaries, land characteristics, potential resources, and development opportunities related to diverse sectors (Auricht and Rais 2000). They aimed to coordinate and stimulate economic growth as well as plan for the efficient delivery of government services. Plans could be renewed every five years. Reflecting the pressures for wider political participation at the time in Indonesia, the law also allowed for citizen input, although in practice input was rarely solicited or offered.\nThe extent of decentralization in this phase was limited. Mapping was concentrated at the provincial level, and the finalization of the integrated maps was highly contentious through the 1990s. The MOF largely stalled and resisted the efforts of the planning boards, and few new plans resulted. Top-down decision making prevailed, and it was not uncommon for executive decrees at the national level to override plans (Widiangsih and Morrell 2007).\nA third phase of land-use planning began after the end of the Soeharto regime. Widespread reforms occurred from 1999 to 2004 that decentralized authority to elected district officials, empowered district assemblies, and channeled considerably more financial resources to district agencies. Although the RTRW framework remained intact, districts sought to create or redo their plans as a way to assert their new-found autonomy (cf. Mintzberg 1993). They rarely attempted to coordinate with provincial plans. The province of East Kalimantan revised its spatial plan in 1999, but it took years to be approved because of conflicts with the many new district plans. The district plans were valid for 10 yr with evaluation after five.\nMany of the old problems of centralized land-use planning persisted. Jakarta-based consulting companies prepared plans in their offices, rarely if ever making field visits, using public input, or incorporating good maps or data. Plans were photocopied from other districts. In East Kalimantan, the plans routinely permitted the use of areas protected in Indonesia's National Conservation Plan in 1981\/1982 (Jepson et al. 2002). The new district planning system became a tool for legitimizing private access to district resources with little protection or concern for the public interest (Wollenberg et al. 2006b).\nAs before, district plans also bore little relation to what people did in the forest. In the institutional gap created during the transition to new district control, semi-autonomous local political orders emerged in which local indigenous groups, business interests, and the bureaucratic elite did their best to capture local benefits from forests regardless of existing land-use plans, legal frameworks, or central directives (McCarthy 2002, 2004, Wollenberg et al. 2006b). Districts rapidly organized small-scale timber harvesting and sought out investment schemes for conversion of natural forest to more lucrative crops.\nAfter 2004, new national laws and regulations tried to recentralize what most people perceived as the rampant abuse of local control. Law No. 32 required district governments to coordinate their land-use planning with the provinces and the national authorities, and Regulation 26 in 2008 gave provincial governors and national ministers the right to override land-use decisions made by the districts. Indonesia continues, however, to lack a coherent government apparatus that can work across multiple administrative levels and sectors and use transparent means to resolve conflicts (McCarthy 2004).\nSpatial plans in forest areas are still poorly designed and implemented. Their quality has been compromised by a history of centralized sector-based planning, a lack of information about existing forest and land characteristics, and weak stakeholder input (S\u00e8ve 1999). Implementation of spatial plans has been hampered by a number of factors, including (1) inaccurate and inconsistent maps produced under various spatial planning policies; (2) poor coordination of the Ministry of Forestry with other ministries (S\u00e8ve 1999, Jepson et al. 2002); (3) poor coordination among district, provincial, and central bodies; (4) presidential decrees that took precedence over existing plans (Widiangsih and Morrell 2007); (5) a lack of local government capacity or will; (6) vested political and business interests (McCarthy 2002); (7) a lack of financial resources (Murdiono 1998); or (8) simply the unavailability of the plan (Murdiono 1998, Auricht and Rais 2000).\nAlthough Indonesia's forest land-use plans are intended to support development goals, few address the local drivers of development or anticipate future circumstances. Information about the plans is rarely shared with other stakeholders, and the 5- to 10-yr plans are usually revised only to meet the needs of special interests. Such reliance on prescriptive long-term plans leaves little room for discretionary decision making and flexibility (Lloyd and"}
{"text":" Peel 2007). Plans under these conditions establish predetermined spatial arrangements and outcomes that serve the purposes of accountability and bureaucratic control, although they quickly become irrelevant when prescriptions are not possible or desirable, especially in situations in which political regimes are unstable, policies are in transition, natural environments change, or high levels of innovation are needed. Even as tools for accountability and control, their use is limited because they quickly lose any claim to relevance. Local land users feel no ownership of these plans, and their rights are often ignored.\nConventional planning in such contexts gives government and land-use managers a false sense of control that can lead to unanticipated outcomes and inattentiveness to critical threats or opportunities. The emphasis on plans skews attention away from real opportunities for local action. As a result, strategic decisions are often made outside of formal plans (Stacey 2003), because decisions have to be made incrementally, not all at once.\nMalinau was created in 1999 when the previous district of Bulungan was divided into three new districts. The district is 42,000 km\u00b2 in size, and about 60% of its 50,000 residents are concentrated in the district capital. The 15,000\u201320,000 people living in the forested parts of Malinau are primarily Dayak swidden cultivators and Punan hunter-gatherers who rely on forests for their livelihoods and live in settlements of 30\u20131000 individuals (Sellato 2001, Sheil et al. 2006). Swidden cultivation and small-scale timber harvesting occur in localized areas throughout the district, and there are two small coal mines.\nThe district is 90% forest and contains the largest remaining contiguous area of Dipterocarp forest in the world. Forest land formally belongs to the state. Timber concessions allocated through Jakarta under past governments control rights to timber, although district governments have challenged these rights by allocating their own permits for timber harvesting and by changing land-use plans. The district includes most of the 1.6 million-ha Kayan Mentarang National Park, one of 80 major ecosystem reserves identified in the first national Biodiversity Action Plan and RePPProT 2002 (Jepson 2002 et al.) and has high conservation value for plants and animals (Meijaard and Nijman 2003, Sheil et al. 2006). Annual rainfall is nearly 4000 mm, and the general erosion risk is high (Basuki and Sheil 2005).\nThe Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) began working in Malinau in 1995 and in 1998 initiated a multistakeholder land-use planning project with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry and the district of Malinau. The aim of the project was to integrate information across different land uses and users to produce a more dynamic systems approach to land-use planning. An interdisciplinary team of about six researchers led the effort, which focused on the Malinau and Tubu watersheds. The project paid special attention to local swidden farmers and hunter-gathers, because these were groups that had been systematically excluded from prior land-use planning.\nDespite intentions and efforts to do otherwise, the project operated independently from the district's own land-use planning process. Malinau developed its own district land-use plan in 2002. A Jakarta-based consultant prepared maps based on information from the previous district of Bulungan, with little or no public participation and no field visits. CIFOR provided extensive ecological, forest, and social data, but the final plan showed no evidence that these data had been incorporated. The consultants presented the plan at a public hearing in the district capital that included officials and CIFOR invitees, but no village representatives from Malinau's forested areas.\nDuring subsequent closed negotiations in 2003, the district increased the amount of conversion forest by nearly 600,000 ha and decreased reserves and limited production forest to make land available for oil palm development and increase their control vis-\u00e0-vis the national government over land and timber revenues (Andrianto 2006). This decision was made in spite of technical suitability measures that indicating the land should remain under forest cover. After several rounds of minor revisions, the plans were finally adopted and legalized in 2003.\nThe district did not make the final plan public. Our project team's efforts to see a copy of the plan were always rebuffed. Secrecy helped the district to accommodate investors without public scrutiny. In 2004 a new investor requested a block of land for an oil palm plantation. The land included part of an existing timber concession and forest in which conversion was not permitted. The district reportedly reduced the concession of the parastatal company Inhutani II from 48,000 ha to less than 28,000 ha in the land-use plan. In February 2005, Malinau submitted the revision to the Minister of Forestry for approval, but it was refused. The local government signed the memorandum of understanding with the investor anyway. The provincial government later accommodated the conversion request in its 10-yr plan, but in 2006 the Minister of"}
{"text":" Forestry rejected the province's plans to convert 1 million ha of forest to oil palm.\nThe resulting content of the plan was as disappointing as the process. The plan emphasized forest conversion and plantation development that would require intensive soil inputs and erosion control and decrease local people's control over land and livelihoods. It did not recognize the appropriateness of maintaining forest cover for the area or make provisions for sustainable forestry (Meijaard et al. 2005). Based on an analysis of 600 soil samples and 200 site characterizations using land and soil criteria developed by the Indonesian Department of Agriculture, Basuki and Sheil (2005) found that all 200 sites were marginal for the production of cash crops like pepper, coffee, rubber, or oil palm. The best sites for plantations were the alluvial plains along rivers in which local people already lived and cultivated their crops. The plan did not recognize that existing cultivation systems were sustainable only because the local people used small amounts of land, chose the best sites, maintained vegetative cover, had established long fallow periods, and rarely cultivated the same crop or field two years consecutively (E. Dounias and G. Loutrel, unpublished manuscript).\nHow can the government plan land use in Indonesia's forest areas to more effectively take into account local land capacities, the priorities of local land users, and changing conditions? On the one hand, Indonesia's existing planning frameworks produce clear rules that signal obligations and interests in efficient, transparent language that serve the formal needs of the state and citizens. On the other, the complexity of managing Indonesia's forest lands demands practical local knowledge, discretionary decision making, social processes, and adaptation (Rose 1994).\nDistrict land-use planning should link and balance these two approaches to provide not just a set of designations and control points but also an opportunity to refine and adapt decisions at larger scales based on practical experience and communication among different groups. Decision makers and citizens still need the ordered and simplified rules of a formal plan, but as part of a process that better reflects the real evolving local conditions and uncertainties that land users and managers face. A plan thus becomes only a small part of what a land-use planning team should be doing.\nSupport local groups to make their local knowledge, experience, and aspirations more visible to formal land-use planning and decision making. Local information is costly to attain, coordinate, and use, and local groups are often not accustomed to communicating information needed for planning. Nevertheless, local-level information is essential for local needs and conditions to be acknowledged in planning, as well as for local land users to feel ownership. Clarity about tenure and rights is fundamental to understanding who should have input into land-use plans.\nCreate channels of communication, feedback, and transparency to support the adaptive capacities and accountability of district leadership and institutions. Open and multiple channels of communication and a commitment to transparency allow people to challenge, debate, and exchange information about the appropriateness of plans and when and how to adjust them. Leadership must be ready to take advantage of opportunities, quickly recognize threats, and balance trade-offs. Public input and review should occur with adequate advance notice and funding from the district. Civil society and other government members should have access to documents, and proposed and final plans should be available in easy-to-read formats.\nUnderstand the drivers of change and the scenarios associated with different land-use options, including trade-offs among objectives, using system frameworks. Whereas land-use plans may be appropriate at the time they are produced, in regions of uncertainty and rapid change plans can quickly be overtaken by new circumstances. Understanding possible trajectories of change from a systems perspective makes decision makers more attentive to what kinds of changes might occur and how to cope with them (Prato 2007). Systems-based tools can incorporate local practical knowledge as well as represent changes in simple ways to complement maps.\nLink analysis and intervention across multiple levels, from the local land user to the district and national levels. Land-use planning inevitably leads to a focus on a particular scale of analysis. In Malinau this is the district level, but what happens at this level is partially determined by land-use decisions made at lower levels and influenced by decisions at provincial and national levels. Thus, multiple levels of analysis and intervention and efforts to explicitly link these different levels are necessary (Sayer and Campbell 2004). District planners need to hold planning activities in villages, harness the frames of reference and perspectives of stakeholders at other levels, lobby at higher levels, and enable people from different levels to work out agreements together.\nIn this section we explain how the project applied the four principles from 1998 to 2005.\nIn Malinau, as in most forest areas of Indonesia, the voice of local Dayak and Punan villagers was rarely heard in district land-use planning (S\u00e8ve 1999). CIFOR concentrated its effort on enabling these villagers to express their knowledge, experience, and aspirations. Villagers had the most to lose from district plans, because their livelihoods depended directly on agriculture and forest resources. Their"}
{"text":" ability to coordinate information and influence district policy was compromised by the huge distances between settlements and by ethnic divisions.\nVillagers were also the groups most interested in working with CIFOR. The local small timber industries and mining companies were the least interested; they viewed land-use planning as a threat to their operations. Although district officials from different departments showed interest, they often needed permission to participate, were called away to district business at the last minute, or shifted roles, making it difficult to invest in building relationships with them.\nGiven the intense and volatile competition for forest claims during the decentralization transition (1999\u20132000), we focused most of our efforts on supporting villagers' claims to land and forest resources. We helped make those claims visible mainly through maps and research on village land uses and values. A team facilitated participatory mapping of village boundaries in 2000 for 21 villages in the Malinau watershed (Anau et al. 2001). Although these maps were an imperfect solution and by themselves did not capture the entitlements, they were probably the most important practical tool the project produced that villages could use to communicate their needs to government and timber companies. The maps could also be readily shared with formal planners and integrated into their maps.\nOur research further showed that the villagers' use of forest resources extended beyond village areas and was more fluid than village boundaries would suggest. For hunting and gathering, individuals used their social networks to access a vast and fluid network of sites and forest trails that could not be easily mapped (Fig. 1). The social networks were determined by interethnic and intervillage relationships and subject to change. Any allocation of formal rights had to recognize these fluid and socially embedded informal rights and allow people the flexibility they needed to exercise them.\nLocal people's perceptions of the landscape and the significance and value they assigned to the geographic locations of different sites and services were important to demonstrate why villagers claimed these lands and wanted to use them in particular ways (e.g., Cunliffe et al. 2006, Lynam et al. 2006, Sheil et al. 2006). For example, local people highly valued old village sites and fruit orchards and wanted them protected against logging and other damage. Old village sites not only had heritage value but were also abundant in fruit species, making fruits such as durian (Durio spp.), coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Artocarpus spp., and mangos (Mangifera spp.) relatively plentiful. These fruits in turn attracted significant attention from frugivores, which the local people enjoyed hunting. People also valued the limestone outcrops and caves that are the home of swiftlets (mostly Collocalia spp.), whose nests have considerable cultural and commercial significance, and wanted to establish protected areas around them, as in the 1-km exclusion zones in Malinau.\nOfficials undervalued local people's reliance on swidden agriculture and made little effort to accommodate it in land-use plans, other than to allocate 1 ha of land per family for permanent agriculture within village boundaries. A study of farmers in Malinau's Tubu watershed showed that choices about the location of the swidden and the type of forest used varied dramatically from year to year (Fig. 2). Fluctuations depended on the composition and availability of household labor, the farmers' health status, ever-changing partnerships and alliances among households, and the balance among agriculture and hunting, fishing, and gathering at any one time (Fig. 3). In 1994 and 2002, when there was mast fruiting and large numbers of wild bearded pigs in the area, farmers created swiddens from young fallows near the villages, rather than investing in clearing older forests for more productive land. In contrast, in years like 1989 and 1998\u20132000, they made massive clearings in distant primary forest or very old fallows. The severe interannual fluctuations of fruiting and bearded pig populations in Dipterocarp forests accordingly affect the strategies of forest dwellers and influence how land is used. Assessing the land needed in 1994 would have led to a detrimental underestimation of the land cover they actually need to practice swidden agriculture.\nThe research team also worked to bridge the gaps between groups so that they could communicate their values and practices directly to one another and participate in all decisions that affected them. We did this by facilitating meetings among groups who did not ordinarily meet with one another, documenting and disseminating stakeholders' views, monitoring land use and social conditions, and supporting awareness of good governance measures. Such communication and involvement were essential so that decision makers could integrate information from different sources and at different scales as they adapted to changing conditions.\nMultistakeholder forums addressed forest policy issues at the community, district, and provincial levels. They included annual meetings with all the villages in the Malinau watershed, to which government officials were invited and at which a community-government dialogue was held. The CIFOR team also arranged for government officials to attend village activities and for villagers to visit district officials."}
{"text":" These events were generally well attended and successful in creating opportunities for dialogue. Participants saw them as opportunities for getting new information.\nTeam members monitored forest and social conditions at the village level from 2000 to 2005, providing data and analysis three to five times each year to both villagers and government officials that helped to document the rapid changes in forest use occurring at the time. This information was critical to building awareness in the district about the rapidity and extent of changes occurring during the reform era.\nResearchers also collected the views of different stakeholders about desirable governance in Malinau in terms of representation, accountability, land-use planning, agreements, sharing forest benefits, conflict management, and sharing of information (Wollenberg et al. 2006a). Although district officials and villagers agreed that communities should provide input on land-use planning, the research showed that there was considerable variation in people's expectations about forest governance and only a limited capacity to practice many of these principles. Communication and accountability were often limited in Malinau by top-down and clientelist governance.\nCIFOR researchers assisted stakeholders in Malinau to explore potential changes, trends, and trade-offs through social processes as well as simulation modeling. To establish a shared foundation for the planning process, one of our first activities was a multistakeholder workshop to collectively identify the parameters of Malinau's land-use system and develop a shared vision for land use based on scenario visioning tools (Wollenberg et al. 2000). The group identified the drivers of change they experienced under decentralization, i.e., increased small-scale timber harvesting, increased funds for local development, empowered local citizens, and their collective objectives for the future, which included (1) increased income; (2) clear land use according to rights and land-use functions; (3) the development of organizations that are efficient, coordinated, and transparent; and (4) environmental conservation.\nThis information was used as input for simulation modeling to project the Malinau landscape and economy for 20 yr. The model was designed to stimulate debate about the future rather than be a predictive tool (Sandker et al. 2007, 2008, Campbell et al. 2009). The model could incorporate practical knowledge generated by different groups and allow people to discuss risks and wider concerns and motivations for different kinds of land use, e.g., heritage, gravesites, conservation. Likely drivers of change were included in the model, making it possible to explore diverse scenarios and conduct policy experiments. The model was built together with the planners at the district level, giving them a degree of ownership of the model. In one of the closing workshops for the project, district officials presented the results of different model scenarios to their colleagues. The models highlighted the trade-offs of different development trajectories. For example, a high investment scenario of plantation development brought major development outcomes for the district, but these came at the cost of biodiversity conservation and the likely marginalization of the current land users.\nThe project worked at the district, subdistrict, watershed, village, household, individual, and forest site levels. Analysis and intervention at these multiple levels were essential to understanding land-use patterns at different scales and the motivations or drivers behind them. For example, the impacts of large land-use initiatives such as oil palm or timber plantations often spanned across villages and needed to be understood in terms of their relation to village land claims and household use of forest resources as well as for their impacts on specific forest sites and watersheds.\nWe supported coordination of land-use planning among villages in the Malinau watershed in which small-scale timber extraction was most rampant through the production of village plans and annual meetings. We facilitated the production of scenarios of preferred village land uses, as well as supporting maps, inventories, and management plans. Villages discussed alternatives and documented what existed. One village used the maps to identify their core conservation area and different land-use zones. Another designated areas for timber exploitation, protection, and subsistence use. We worked with the surrounding two or three villages to manage conflicts over land and create similar opportunities for land-use planning. As a result, the area of conserved forest nearly doubled when a neighboring village also allocated land for conservation.\nTo scale up village efforts to the district level, we invited land-use planners and government officials to participate in public village meetings and encouraged the district to communicate to the villagers what was feasible from the district's perspective. Villagers were encouraged to make presentations to district officials about their plans. The project lobbied the provincial and national authorities to recognize these community efforts, for which one village received a national environmental prize and was a finalist for the international World Water Prize.\nResearchers shared the results of all studies with the communities and other local stakeholders to make the analysis available to them and deepen their general understanding. Products took the form of hundreds of newsletters, 3500 posters, 6000 information-rich cards, and several hundred copies of videos. In addition, researchers collaborated with local government and the World Wildlife Fund to develop an environmental education syllabus"}
{"text":" for Malinau's schools (Padmanaba and Sheil 2006).\nThe experience in Malinau reflected the historical context of the postdecentralization and district-driven land-use planning period. Dayak and Punan villagers gained more awareness, provided more input, and negotiated harder for their land-use priorities than had been possible during previous decades (Wollenberg et al. 2007). Land-use planning reached heightened levels of political accountability and participation. Rigorously collected local data were organized in GIS models and applied in spatial modeling.\nDespite the richness of these developments, the district produced a conventional land-use plan and subsequent land-use decisions that departed from that plan. Decisions lacked relevance to Malinau's land capabilities and the existing land-use practices of the local people. Instead, these decisions served the interests of district officials in income-generating projects, which they justified with narratives about \"economic development\" and \"modernization.\" They also helped maintain political capital among the district's entrepreneurs and selected village leaders who also benefited from the schemes. The politics of land use, driven by the possibilities for economic gain, thus took precedence over technical planning considerations.\nPolitics prevailed in previous eras as well, only this time the politics that mattered most were at the district level, and many government officials and entrepreneurs were themselves local people and even indigenous leaders (cf. McCarthy 2004, Wollenberg et al. 2005). Indonesia's political traditions of hierarchical decision making, paternalism, secrecy, and local clientelism enabled officials to fall back on old-style decision making. As Hudalah and Woltjer (2007) point out, these forces point to a basic tension inherent in Indonesian land-use planning between introduced western models of planning and the existing decision-making culture. Officials pay attention to formal planning at a token superficial level, yet fall back on more comfortable and binding social norms when conflicts among interests occur. As districts experimented with other participatory, democratic approaches such as public consultations and accountability reports during this period, there were similar tensions and efforts to shift between the more accountable measures and old political habits. Officials and citizens appeared to be trying the new methods out like new outfits, not always sure what would fit and sometimes preferring their old favorites.\nIronically, in this way, land-use planning in the postdecentralization period was more localized and adaptive, but the related decisions were not transparent, clearly in the public interest, or scientifically based. They gave primacy to the interests of a few at the district level, compromising the land-use priorities of multiple local land users and national bodies. Relocating land-use planning to local levels and using adaptive decision making are therefore not enough to ensure more interactive land-use planning. Although empowerment of local communities has been a powerful force for change, as our experience shows, it may not be enough to sufficiently democratize land-use decisions and change relative power relations if the forces in power do not need or have any incentive to change (Garnett et al. 2007).\nTo make planning more relevant in places like Malinau, we need to shift our thinking about planning away from planning as an instrument of control to one of innovation and action (Byrne 2003:171). Byrne says that we need to work with people in a participatory way to specify the range of possible futures and establish actions that will produce the futures people want. Facilitation and intervention according to the principles in this article can help. In Malinau the four principles presented here gave villagers and officials the tools they needed to tackle the entrenched political culture and work in parallel to it. Although the results did not change the entire system, they did increase awareness of alternatives and balance tensions with old political traditions. Villagers developed higher expectations of local governance (Wollenberg et al. 2006a), officials gained more awareness of local priorities, and some villages more actively resisted pressures for logging (Iwan 2004).\nThe project highlighted conflicts associated with (1) the district's aim to generate income through large-scale extractive projects; (2) conservation priorities for species and area protection that differed among local people and national and international bodies; and (3) local people's needs for land rights and flexibility in managing their forest, swidden, and fallows to respond to variations in natural resource availability, fluctuating social networks, and their needs for flexibility of access and benefit sharing. In each case, the conflicts involved the constraining of discretionary decision making by other parties. These conflicting needs suggest that the requirement for governance measures and interactive land-use planning is much higher than most people assume, even at the local level.\nThe district government and communities never fully developed the leadership, will, or institutional capacity to carry out more dynamic forms of land-use planning independently. Although the concepts of adaptive management and participation were attractive, they involved skills, information, coordination, and resources that were often not available, especially in a newly formed district struggling with more immediate pressures in a chaotic policy environment. These factors may be ultimately the"}
{"text":" most important limits to implementing more dynamic forms of land-use planning (cf. Lebel et al. 2007, Prato 2007, Wollenberg et al. 2007).\nEfforts to improve planning almost always focus on technical aspects, forgetting that in many places capacities do not exist to carry these out. When land-use planning enables discretionary decision making, strong governance systems for transparency and more sensitivity and capacity building among decision makers are necessary (Lloyd and Peel 2007). Capacities need to be built in both government and members of civil society, including sources such as universities or NGOs who can facilitate training and communication.\nThe kind of planning we are advocating is expensive. Interactive planning should be most appropriate in places of high resource value and threat, in which the stakes are high. Conventional plans can still play a role in land-use decisions, provided that they are more adaptive, participatory, and set in larger governance frameworks. Interactive planning may benefit from external facilitation, because dynamic contexts often make it difficult for planners and managers to invest in the necessary transaction costs of participation and information exchange.\nThe research was supported by the International Tropical Timber Organization (IITO), the Department for International Development (DfID) UK, the Ford Foundation, the District of Malinau, and the Netherlands Committee of IUCN.

{"text":"Alternative energy can effectively replace foss...\nseldiora\nAlternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels\n3RU7AL\nalternative energy: energy generated in ways that do not deplete natural resources or harm the environment, especially by avoiding the use of fossil fuels and nuclear power.\neffective: producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect (in this case, sufficient to replace fossil fuels as an energy source)\nfossil fuels: a natural fuel such as coal or gas, formed in the geological past from the remains of living organisms.\nI will combine all my research into one round, as my previous opponent unfortunately forfeited the final round.\nA study says: \"Dramatic fall in costs of renewable energy in the last 24 months has not only accelerated the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy in electricity generation. The low cost renewable electricity is now starting to replace fossil fuels in other sectors....Another reason is that electricity often offer other opportunities, such as cheaper transport, better control, higher energy efficiency in final production of energy services and lower local environmental costs. Remember that, even if fossil fuel based technology seemed more efficient a long time ago, technology improves over time, and the buying of the fuel itself can result in extra transaction cost that outweighs the one time building of the alt. energy source. Let me prove it with another source:\n\"Between 2010 and 2019, the cost of large, utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects \u2013 where energy is converted directly into electricity \u2013 fell by 82%.\nWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about climate change?\nOver the same period, the other main type of solar, concentrating solar power \u2013 which uses mirrors or lenses to create power through heat \u2013 fell by 47%. Falls in wind power costs are also significant: 39% for onshore wind and 29% for offshore.\" Unless con can refute the first study, and IRENA's recent showing of the progress in the last 10 years, it seems to me he has lost.\nGlobal warming (CO2 generation) -- to avoid this become *that* debate, here's source that proves CO2 causes rising temperature, pollution (leading to \" $74.6 billion a year in public health burdens \"), these are crucial problems that cause fossil fuel to be controversial. Not to mention that in terms of jobs, \" 335,000 people work in the solar industry and more than 111,000 work in the wind industry, compared to 211,000 working in coal mining or other fossil fuel extraction\". That's right, even more people work in alt than fossil fuels. So... Alt. energy is env. friendly, causes no pollution, and is far more stable than fuels overall. Fossil fuel has extra costs other than merely money associated with it, especially with public health and environment. Unless con can refute this, alt. energy not only can replace fossil fuel effectively, it is actually far far superior.\nTrends:\nAccording to a scholarly study, \"Total funding for RE has been rising at a remarkable rate. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), the amount of RE finance... rose from USD 45 billion in 2004 to 270 billion in 2014 globally (Fig. 2). This represents a compound annual growth rate of 18%. Moreover, in 2014, net investment into new capacity, as opposed to replacing depreciated assets, was twice as large for RE as it was for fossil fuels in the power sector; this trend is forecast to continue for the rest of this decade\". Now you see how reasonable renewable energy overtaking fossil fuel is.\nBig companies are following suit. Silicon Angle says, \"Meanwhile, Google LLC announced today it's making what it says is the biggest-ever corporate purchase of renewable energy, increasing its worldwide wind and solar energy portfolio by more than 40%, to 5,500 megawatts.\" The same goes for Amazon investment. Just a few listed here are Visa, Blackstone, Brookfield Renewable Partners, etc... \"over the next 10 years, $5 trillion to $10 trillion overall will be invested into renewable energy worldwide\". It's clear that financial wise it will be a big market and can effectively replace that of fossil fuels.\nElectric Support:\n\"A thorough analysis carried out by the University of Delaware and Delaware Technical Community College concluded that renewable energy could reliably power a large electrical grid 99.9 per cent of the time by 2030, at a cost that matches today's electricity prices.\" Another site supported that with wide distribution of power sources, alternative energy can do well. It's very long of a study, but some crucial facts are: \"Dispatchability: Resilient DERs can respond to a disruption at any time with little to no advance warning.\n2. Islanding Capability: Resilient DERs have the ability to isolate from the grid and serve load during a\nbroader outage.\n3. Siting at Critical Loads\/Locations: Resilient DERs reside at critical loads or at critical points on the grid\n("}
{"text":"e.g., areas of high residential density).\n4. Fuel Security: Resilient DERs do not rely on the availability of a limited physical fuel to provide power...\" So on and so forth.\nAs you can see more distributed energy sources are quite reliable. National Renewable Energy Lab has a famous quote, \"Renewable electricity generation from technologies that are commercially available today, in combination with a more flexible electric system, is more than adequate to supply 80% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2050. \"\nI would like to thank PRO for hosting this thought-provoking debate.\n(C.R2.01) Cost:\nAlthough the financial cost of solar and wind and batteries has been declining, the net-energy-gain from these \"alternatives\" remains negative.\nBased on data from our NH home and a worst-case scenario, it would take 29 years for a panel to recoup this 100% energy investment. [01]\nThink of a solar panel or a wind turbine as a battery.\nNow think of all the (oil and coal) energy you use to mine the materials, build and operate the manufacturing plant and equipment, cook the food for the designers and scientists and miners and drivers involved in the process, not to mention the (oil and coal) energy you use to heat and cool the facilities and vehicles involved. If you take all that energy and you compare it to the energy you get out of the solar panel or wind turbine, it would violate the laws of thermodynamics if you were able to generate OVER-PARITY (more energy output than you input).\nNot to mention the energy cost of disposal (or \"recycling\" at end-of-life-cycle).\nSolar panels often contain lead, cadmium, and other toxic chemicals that cannot be removed without breaking apart the entire panel. \"Approximately 90% of most PV modules are made up of glass,\" notes San Jose State environmental studies professor Dustin Mulvaney. \"However, this glass often cannot be recycled as float glass due to impurities. Common problematic impurities in glass include plastics, lead, cadmium and antimony.\"\nResearchers with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) undertook a study for U.S. solar-owning utilities to plan for end-of-life and concluded that solar panel \"disposal in \"regular landfills [is] not recommended in case modules break and toxic materials leach into the soil\" and so \"disposal is potentially a major issue.\" [02]\n(C.R2.02) Health:\nAlthough solar panels and wind turbines emit much less pollution LOCALLY, the manufacturing process still emits the same amount of pollutants as conventional sources (per watt of energy yield). Especially if you consider the disposal (or \"recycling\") cost.\n(C.R2.03) Trends:\nCertainly these \"alternatives\" are becoming more popular and more dollar efficient. This trend does not however magically violate the second law of thermodynamics.\n(C.R2.04) Electric Support:\n[01] https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-much-conventional-energy-is-used-to-manufacture-a-solar-panel-say-250Wp-and-how-much-solar-energy-does-the-same-panel-generate-in-its-life-time\n[02] https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michaelshellenberger\/2018\/05\/23\/if-solar-panels-are-so-clean-why-do-they-produce-so-much-toxic-waste\/#1bb4f375121c\nSo con has decided to drop everything and try to focus on net problems as well as waste disposal. I have remarkable questions about his use of Quora, and exactly whose source he is referring to. The former physics and engineering teacher remarks in his final paragraph, \"a fossil fuel generator can make enough energy to produce itself in just a couple days, but we don't know how to make fossil fuels stop polluting at a similarly quick pace. However, we do know how to use that dirty energy to make a lot of solar panels that don't pollute. That example gas turbine generator could make a solar panel every 30 minutes it runs; the Merrimack Station generates enough to make 50 panels every hour. How many panels could have been made in the hours since 1968? (Answer: 22 million solar panels!) Yes, it may realistically take a few years for one solar panel to collect enough electricity to make another one just like it, but then we'd have twice as many solar panels that don't pollute. I think that means we better stop fooling around and make more solar panels!\"\nThe one man who agrees with con is a Sales professional, not energy expert, so it's hard to say for"}
{"text":" sure. SolarCraft confirms pro side by saying: \" A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory conclusively demonstrates that the manufacturing energy cost versus the energy production payback for solar modules is generally less than 4 years.\" So it's very clear that over time it works out for renewable energy, and con side is not a problem.\nSecondly, Forbes is a news site and that article was two years ago. Since then we have made much progress on research. Turkey had been able to recycle a lot of the metal toxic waste, and scholar resource suggests this is key to solving con's problems. There is still a little more work to be done but overall there is a net positive impact on the environment. (\" Considering the full life cycle of the panel, the energy produced by the panel grants the most significant environmental benefits. However, benefits due to high-efficient recycling are relevant for some impact categories, especially for the resource depletion indicator. The article also points out that thermal treatments are generally necessary to grant the high efficiency in the recycling.\")\nApplying second law of thermodynamics does not work in terms of trends or support.\n(C.R3.01) THE INVISIBLE ENERGY COST OF DISPOSAL\/RECYCLING\n(C.R3.01.A) RECYCLING SOLAR\nIt's significant to note that the energy cost of disposal\/recycling of photovoltaics is shockingly absent from all net-energy-gain estimates.\n\"We believe the big blind spot in the U.S. for recycling is that the cost far exceeds the revenue,\" Meng said. \"It's on the order of a 10-to-1 ratio.\" [01]\nInterestingly, studies by Latunussa et al., 2016, Wambach, 2017, Aryan et al. (2018) and Corcelli et al. (2018) agree on the environmental significance of incinerating the halogenated plastics in the backsheet. Unfortunately, as reported by Wambach (2017), if the 'halogen content is too high, then incineration in a specialized hazardous waste plant must be carried out', in order to minimize the emission of potentially toxic air pollutants such as hydrogen fluoride (HF). Moreover, the above-mentioned studies provided little information on the impacts of incinerating PV plastics. For example, Corcelli et al. (2018) estimated that the incineration of waste panels releases 0.87\u202fg\/m2 of HF, while Latunussa et al. (2016) considered life cycle inventory data for general plastic incineration. [01.b]\nFinally, it is confirmed that the low quantity of PV waste collected so far is discouraging investments in industrial processes for PV recycling. However, this situation is not a justification for delaying research in this field, or the problem of managing PV waste is simply postponed to the near future. Claims about the sustainability of PV technologies cannot be fully supported until efficient and environmentally-friendly recycling processes for them have been developed and are deployable. [01.b]\n(C.R3.01.B) RECYCLING WIND\nIt's significant to note that the energy cost of disposal\/recycling of wind-turbines is shockingly absent from all net-energy-gain estimates.\nXcel Energy estimates conservatively that it will cost $532,000 (in 2019 dollars) to decommission [NOT RECYCLE] each of its wind turbines [02]\n(C.R3.02) EROEI & ESOEI\nHere's some good news. When comparing energy-return-on-investment for both energy production methods and energy storage methods there are some interesting winners and losers.\n(C.R3.02.A) EROIE (Energy Return on Energy Invested) [03]\nEROEI 106:1 - Nuclear\nEROEI 51:1 - Wind\nEROEI 50:1 - Hydroelectric\nEROEI 31:1 - Coal\nEROEI 28:1 - Natural Gas\nEROEI 21:1 - Parabolic Solar\nEROEI 7:1 - Photovoltaic\nEROEI 3.5:1 - Biogas\nEROEI 1:1 - Ethanol\n(C.R3.02.B) ESOEI (Energy Saved on Energy Invested) [04]\nESOEI 5:1 - Lead acid battery\nESOEI 32:1 - Lithium ion battery\nESOEI 704:1 - Pumped hydroelectric storage\nESOEI 792:1 - Compressed air energy storage\nI would once again like to thank PRO for hosting this thought provoking debate.\n(C.R3.03) SHOCKING CONCLUSIONS\nLet's examine the debate resolution: \"Alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels\"\nDon't get me wrong, I wish we could all switch to solar"}
{"text":" and battery powered cars and call it a day, I really do.\nBut that's not going to get us to the promised land. We tend to forget about all the strip-mining required to gather all those rare & precious rocks.\nIt does look like (based on the EROEI & ESOEI data) we need to focus on WIND and COMPRESSED AIR (both surprisingly efficient).\nAlso, there's a very strong case for microreactors. [05]\nRight, I'm going to still say \"NO\". No they can't.\nSolar + batteries is shockingly inefficient.

His own source says US is horrible at Recycling and must reform that policy rather than stop using alternative energy:\nWhen solar panels do reach their end of their life today, they face a few possible fates. Under E.U. law, producers are required to ensure their solar panels are recycled properly. In Japan, India, and Australia, recycling requirements are in the works. In the United States, it's the Wild West: With the exception of a state law in Washington, the U.S. has no solar recycling mandates whatsoever. Voluntary, industry-led recycling efforts are limited in scope. \"Right now, we're pretty confident the number is around 10 percent of solar panels recycled,\" said Sam Vanderhoof, the CEO of Recycle PV Solar, one of the only U.S. companies dedicated to PV recycling. The rest, he says, go to landfills or are exported overseas for reuse in developing countries with weak environmental protections.\nAlso, he uses the same scholarly source as I did but fails to copy the entire abstract where it says that the efficient recycling with PV can manage waste relatively well.\nDropped arguments: current trends are looking to replace fossil fuels and big companies no longer want to use coals energy, despite con's claims. The support for electricity is entirely possible and can efficiently replace fossil fuels. Vote for pro.\n(C.R4.01) PRO CLAIMS RECYCLING \"PROBLEM\" IS SOLVED\nExhibit A:\nCon says that recycling costs too much, but forgets that I already acknowledged this and that highly efficient recycling, for example, that existing in Turkey's, can generate more revenue than costs. His own source [also PRO's own source, both exactly the same source] says US is horrible at Recycling and must reform that policy rather than stop using alternative energy:\nHere's what PRO chose to highlight,\nThis highlighted quote (from PRO) is evidence that recycling is a major problem that is NOT currently solved.\nAlso, even in countries where photovoltaic recycling is mandatory, PRO fails to mention anything about the ENERGY cost and or TOXIC byproducts.\nPRO continues,\nPRO also fails to \"copy the entire abstract\". I'm really not sure why PRO expects me to build a case for them, but here's \"the entire abstract\" as requested,\nAlthough the amount of waste photovoltaic (PV) panels is expected to grow exponentially in the next decades, little research on the resource efficiency of their recycling has been conducted so far. Conversely, high-efficient recycling can meet these targets and allows to recover high quality materials (as silicon, glass and silver) that are generally lost in base-case recycling. The benefits due to the recovery of these materials counterbalance the larger impacts of the high-efficiency recycling process. However, benefits due"}
{"text":" to high-efficient recycling are relevant for some impact categories, especially for the resource depletion indicator. The article also points out that thermal treatments are generally necessary to grant the high efficiency in the recycling. Nevertheless, these treatments have to be carefully assessed since they can be responsible for the emissions of air pollutants (as hydrogen fluoride potentially released from the combustion of halogenated plastics in the panel's backsheet). The article also identifies and assesses potential modifications to the high-efficiency recycling process, including the delocalisation of some treatments for the optimisation of waste transport and the introduction of pyrolysis in the thermal processing of the waste. Finally, recommendations for product designers, recyclers and policymakers are discussed, in order to improve the resource efficiency of future PV panels. [01]\nCertainly this study aims to show that the recycling process can be improved, but it does absolutely nothing to suggest that recycling is anywhere close to energy neutral and or non-toxic.\nThe primary focus of this study (and PRO's argument in general) is purely in dollars cost and dollars recovered.\nI believe we would all be much better served with a focus on gross energy cost and net energy recovered.\nWe could conceivably build wind turbines out of 100% steel and aluminum (both materials easily recycled).\nPeople seem to be completely blind to the fact that toxic materials are REQUIRED for the production of photovoltaics (and computers and electronics).\nPeople seem to be completely blind to the fact that fiberglass (used in wind turbines) is impossible to recycle.\n(C.R4.02) PRO'S COMPLAINTS\nDropped arguments: current trends are looking to replace fossil fuels and big companies no longer want to use coals energy, despite con's claims.\nI never disputed what \"big companies\" want or don't want.

PRO's pursuit of this line of reasoning is immaterial to the debate resolution.\n(C.R4.03) PRO'S FINAL STATEMENT\nThe support for electricity is entirely possible and can efficiently replace fossil fuels.

Specifically, I examine the extent to which McMahon's account is able to address a series of objections against the case for managerial democracy as articulated by Thomas Christiano.

First, Christiano argues that McMahon does not succeed in ruling out the possibility that managerial authority is best understood as promissory in its basis, in which case there is no presumption in favor (...) of its democratic exercise. Second, Christiano raises a series of objections to the effect that even if we accept McMahon's account of the nature of managerial authority, the conclusion for the democratic exercise of that authority by workers at the level of individual economic enterprises does not follow. In the end, I argue that McMahon's account contains the resources to address these objections if one adopts a specific view about the moral limits to relationships that involve the submission of the will on the part of one person to another. Adoption of this view, however, appears to come at the expense of what I take to be the account's commitment to liberalism.

While the law aims to restrict harmful behavior and to provide remedies, legal systems do not anticipate all contingencies and legal regulations are not always well-enforced. This article argues that the logic of double effect, which has been developed and deployed in other areas of practical ethics, can be useful in helping business actors decide whether or not to pursue potentially harmful activities in commonplace business activity.

The dissertation considers the role of economic theory in the process of justification and assesses justifications for specific capitalist institutions. The three essays that comprise this dissertation pursue this inquiry by addressing questions respectively in the history of thought, distributive justice, and the ethics of work. ;To advance our general understanding about the development of nineteenth-century Irish political economy in the wake of the Great Irish Famine, the first essay (...) analyzes the Famine's impact on a previously unstudied, yet uniquely authoritative, element of the discipline: the questions given to candidates for the Whately Professorship of Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin. The essay concludes, contrary to previous arguments, that the Famine did not fundamentally influence the discipline's development. Examining justifications for government responses to the Famine in light of this conclusion, the essay considers the role of economic theory in justifying how economic activity is organized. ;Challenging the position that people morally deserve their market earnings often relies on showing that there is little that people can be said to deserve or that market imperfections undermine desert claims. The second essay argues that even if people can generally be deserving and absent market imperfections, people cannot claim to deserve their earnings with respect to four common desert bases: social contribution, effort, compensation and promise of payment. A principle of fairness that requires fulfilling legitimate expectations might ground a moral claim to market earnings, but it is much weaker than moral desert in limiting income redistribution or in justifying use of the market. ;Given the nineteenth-century American labor movement's objection to the employment relationship on grounds that it was a form of servitude, the third essay assesses the extent to which a similar objection applies in contemporary society. The essay argues that despite changes in employment practices, from the standpoint of legitimate authority the employment relationship represents a form of servitude. Given ethical objections to voluntary servitude more generally, this analysis suggests the need for alternatives to the employment relationship, such as worker-owned cooperatives, in a just economy.

{"text":"details\nConventional economic theory assumes that people care only about ultimate outcomes and are indifferent to the decision and allocation processes by which outcomes are brought about. Building on Sen (1997), I relax this assumption, and investigate the formal and philosophical issues that arise. I extend the formal apparatus of preference theory to analyse how processes may enter preferences, and investigate whether traditional invariance requirements like the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference are still satisfied in this new setting. I show that (...) it is, provided certain conditions of separability hold, and I discuss the plausibility of these conditions. Further, I argue that processes are often valued in a mode that diverges from the conventional modes of instrumental and intrinsic\/independent valuation. I introduce the notion of dependent non-instrumental valuation, and show how processes could depend on their instrumental function for their value \u2013 making their value dependent \u2013 and yet derive their value from something else \u2013 making it non-instrumental. Dependent non-instrumental value, I argue, can be explained by symbolic and evidential relations between processes and outcomes.

Over the last decade it has been argued that positive duties also befall commercial agents, at least when confronted with large scale public problems and when governments fail. The argument that enterprises have positive duties is often grounded in the political nature of commercial life. It is argued that agents must sometimes take over governmental responsibilities. The German republican tradition argues along these lines as does (...) class='Hi'>Nien-H\u00e9 Hsieh. Agents in commercial life are bound by positive duties because at some point they become citizens that must take on the responsibilities of the state. In this paper we leave undisputed the claim that corporations must acknowledge positive duties. However, we demonstrate that the political grounding fails, at least in the sense that this theory insufficiently acknowledges a long standing liberal tradition that vindicates apolitical markets and clear borderlines between politics and economics. We carve out an alternative route to the grounding of one specific positive duty\u2014the duty to further justice. Our argument is based on the moral nature of commercial agents and tries to demonstrate that the duty to further justice ensues from liberalism. Taking a Kantian perspective, it conceptualizes the duty to further justice as a moral duty, orientated toward the political domain. It is grounded in the obligation to attain moral autonomy in the civil condition. (shrink)\nDating, the Ethics of Competition, and Heath's Market Failures Approach.Andrew B.

My concern is to show that this is not so and that liberalism is all the better for this. Many elements have contributed to liberal thought as we know it today, the major elements being the liberalism of which Locke is the most celebrated exponent, which is based upon a belief in natural, human rights; (...) the liberalism of which Kant is the best known exponent, which is based on respect for persons as ends in themselves; and the liberalism of Bentham and the Mills, which is based upon utilitarian ethical theories and most especially with concern for pleasure and the reduction of pain. These different elements of liberalism have led to different emphases and different political and social arrangements, but all have involved a concern to safeguard values and to use force to that end. Today they constitute strands of thought which go to make up liberal thought as we now know it, hence it is not simply a historical fact about liberalism, but a fact about its philosophical basis, that liberalism is firmly involved in certain value and moral commitments. In the remainder of this paper I shall seek to bring this out.

Beginning in early August, as part of a one-year pilot program, Bird will deploy up to 200 scooters in southwest Yonkers, including the Downtown-Waterfront area, with the potential of expanding up to 500 scooters to meet demand.\n\"Yonkers is pleased to once again lead the way as a progressive city in offering smart, emission-free transportation solutions for our community,\" said Yonkers Mayor Spano. \"Partnering with Bird will provide residents and visitors the opportunity to travel our city with ease and convenience all while being affordable, reliable and fun.\"\n\"Yonkers' dedication to micromobility is unparalleled, and Bird is honored to serve in the first e-scooter pilot program both here and in New York State,\" said Rebecca Hahn, Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, Bird. \"Like so many New Yorkers, Yonkers residents are adopting more socially-distant transportation habits in the wake of COVID-19. We're looking forward to providing a safe and sustainable way for them to stay mobile and support local businesses as the city continues to recover and rebuild.\"\nThrough the Bird smartphone app, riders can see the closest Bird scooter on a map, unlock it, complete the safety tutorial and ride directly to their desired destination. Upon ending their trip, riders simply park the scooter safely along the side of a sidewalk or on-street next to an unmarked curb and take a photo of the scooter through the app to ensure proper parking.\nThe cost for a Bird ride is $1 to start and 30 cents per minute. Bird also offers low-income access plans that include unlimited 30-minute rides for $5 per month for anyone enrolled in or eligible for a state or federal assistance program.\nIn compliance with the recently enacted New York State law, e-scooters must be used on streets with a posted speed limit of no more than 30 mph. Riders may also use scooters in bike lanes, but must offer the right of way to bicycles. Riders must be 18 years of age to use a Bird scooter in Yonkers.\nYonkers's partnership with Bird marks the second of its kind with a dockless transportation sharing company. The city was the first in the New York City area to embrace dockless bike sharing in 2018, and now will become the first in the state to welcome shared electric scooters nearly three years after the first Birds were launched in Santa Monica in September 2017.\nThe announcement comes less than a month after another notable micromobility first when the United Kingdom officially approved Bird One electric scooters for use in city trials, paving the way for Bird's first UK launch since its scooters were first ridden in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018.\n\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/generation-yonkers-logo-sticky@2x.png 0 0 Generation Yonkers \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/generation-yonkers-logo-sticky@2x.png Generation Yonkers2020-07-31 14:16:252020-07-31 14:16:25CITY OF YONKERS TAPS BIRD TO LAUNCH NEW YORK STATE'S FIRST EVER ELECTRIC SCOOTER PILOT PROGRAM\nYonkers, Cortlandt Launch New Marketing Campaigns\nJuly 10, 2020 \/in News \/by thompsonbender\nClick here to read Real Estate In-Depth's coverage of the \"Back to Business\" campaign.\n\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/generation-yonkers-logo-sticky@2x.png 0 0 thompsonbender \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/generation-yonkers-logo-sticky@2x.png thompsonbender2020-07-10 21:22:552020-07-16 20:26:12Yonkers, Cortlandt Launch New Marketing Campaigns\nNew Marketing Campaign Celebrates Yonkers Getting Back to Business\n\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/generation-yonkers-logo-sticky@2x.png 0 0 thompsonbender \/wp-"}

(Daniel Van Boom \u2013 CNET \u2013 Jul 2021)\n\"A thought experiment, proposed with a grin by Dietmar Detering, a German entrepreneur living in New York: 'What would the climate debate look like if all we had were fossil fuels and renewables, and suddenly someone said, 'I invented something, it's called nuclear energy.\" 'I'm sure we'd develop the hell out of it,' he said, before sighing. 'We're looking at a different world right now.\" Detering thinks nuclear energy could be the key to solving the climate crisis. A former member of Germany's Green Party, Detering now spends his spare time as co-chair of the Nuclear New York advocacy group. He's part of a wave of environmentalists campaigning for more nuclear energy. Though the word evokes images of landscapes pulverized by atomic calamity \u2014 Hiroshima, Chernobyl, Fukushima \u2014 proponents like Detering and his colleague Eric Dawson point out that nuclear power produces huge amounts of electricity while emitting next to no carbon.\"\n\"'Any energy policy has pros and cons, and we feel, after putting a lot of scrutiny on it, that the pros outweigh the cons of nuclear energy,' said Dawson, a grassroots campaigner at Nuclear New York.\"\n\"'Norway, Iceland, New Zealand, countries like these all have a naturally high supply for hydroelectricity, so I'm not promoting nuclear there,' says Dawson, the campaigner from Nuclear New York. 'If [renewables] work, and they provide first-world quality of life, great! But most countries are not able to do that.'\"\n\"Nuclear critics argue that this rise is temporary, and that expanding wind power will eventually replace Indian Point's output. Nuclear New York's Detering rejects this logic. 'People say, 'Well, we're replacing nuclear with wind and solar,' said Detering. 'But I think that is looking at this backwards. We want to displace fossil fuels.'\"\n\"For them it's not a matter of looking for the perfect energy source, but of comparing alternatives. 'Nuclear energy is not fairydust,' says Detering. 'There's waste and there's a risk of something going wrong. Comparing it to something that's real, these are small issues.' For his part, Dawson says he won't advocate for nuclear power if a better alternative emerges. 'But today, I think this is the most reliable, efficient, scalable, carbon-free technology we have,' he said. 'So let's do something that works today.'\"\nNew York Indian Point Nuclear Plant Shuts Down, Ending an Era. (Edward Helmore \u2013 Mother Jones \u2013 May 2021)\n\"According to Nuclear New York, a group opposing closure, Indian Point produced 81 percent of downstate clean energy, with solar and hydro making up 2 percent and 4 percent. Fossil fuels accounted for 67 percent of all state production.\"\nSo Long, Indian Point Nuclear Plant. Hello, More Fossil Fuels. (Sydney Pereira \u2013 Gothamist \u2013 Apr 2021)\n\"Nuclear New York, an advocacy group that fought to keep the plant from closing, estimates fossil fuel-backed plants in the metro area would need to increase electricity generation by one-third to meet demand.\"\n\"'Pretending as if that's sufficient to make up for lost electricity from Indian Point is disingenuous,' Nuclear New York member Isuru Seneviratne said.\"\nIndian Point is Shutting Down. That Means More Fossil Fuel. (Patrick McGeehan \u2013 New York Times \u2013 Apr 2021)\n\"'It's topsy-turvy,' said Isuru Seneviratne, a clean-energy investor who is a member of the steering committee of Nuclear New York, which has lobbied to keep Indian Point running. The pronuclear group calculated that each of Indian Point's reactors had been producing more power than all of the wind turbines and solar panels in the state combined.\"\n\"Mr. Seneviratne said it was inevitable that New York City would draw even more power this year from gas-fired generators after Indian Point closes. On the hottest summer days, when millions of air-conditioners are turned on, gas-burning plants would need to increase their output by as much as one-third, spewing tons of additional carbon dioxide into the air, Nuclear New York had concluded.\"\nReports on Indian Point\nSetting the Record Straight on Indian Point (February 2021) Losing New York's largest source of carbon-free energy, Indian Point, hurts climate and community protection.

This critique should serve as an invitation to PSE and others to address the issue of \"How do we get New York to start to phase out gas?\" (Herschel Specter \u2013 May 2020)\nEE plus RE Cannot Replace Indian Point Every nuclear plant in the United States that has recently closed has been replaced by fossil fuels; none by energy efficiency and none by renewable energy. Indian Point 2 (IP2) is scheduled to close on April 30, 2020 and Indian Point 3 (IP3) a year later. They will be replaced by gas, unless NY State reverses its policies. (Herschel Specter \u2013 April 2020)\nA Reliability Analysis For Riverkeeper The two nuclear units at Indian Point are scheduled to permanently close in April 30, 2020 and exactly one year later. In 2018 this facility produced 16.3 TWh of electricity, equal to 25% of NYC and Westchester demand. Where will the electricity to replace these highly productive, greenhouse gas free, power plants come from? (Herschel Specter \u2013 Jun 2019)\nEnvironmental Justice Issues After Indian Point Closes Closing Indian Point may force NY State\/Con-Ed to increase the use of existing \"peaker\" plants and other fossil fueled power plants, located in Environmental Justice Areas in New York City.

(Herschel Specter \u2013 Sep 2019)\nReplacing Indian Point (Herschel Specter \u2013 Jul 2019) To truly replace Indian Point, any replacement scheme must also be (1) carbon-free, (2) highly reliable, and (3) productive enough to match its output. As New Yorkers demand action on the existential threat of climate change, while keeping them economically vital, this report calls for a rethinking of how to proceed.\nThe Best Emergency Plan for Indian Point, Rev. 2 (Herschel Specter \u2013 Nov 2019)\nA recent comprehensive report from the Citizens Budget Commission, an influential think tank, found that the projected expansion of solar and wind was \"likely infeasible\" Getting Greener: Cost-Effective Options for Achieving New York State's Greenhouse Gas Goals.

The effort is a partnership with Prince George's County Health Department, Greater Baden Medical Services, and Heart to Hand, Inc. and an expansion of similar efforts that IPHi coordinates in the District of Columbia and Virginia. IPHi recently received prestigious national grants from the Kaiser Permanente National Community Benefit Fund at the East Bay Community Foundation, AIDS United, and M\u00b7A\u00b7C AIDS Fund to launch the program, along with funding from Washington AIDS Partnership.\nPrince George's County is home to approximately one-fifth of all people living with HIV in Maryland, second only to Baltimore City. According to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, only 65% of HIV diagnosed persons in the county were linked to care in 2010 and just over one-third (37%) of HIV diagnosed persons were retained in care. Fewer still, 27%, were on antiretroviral therapy, and just 19% achieved viral suppression. These rates are below corresponding rates for Maryland and the nation overall. Research demonstrates that viral suppression is critical not only for the health and quality of life of people living with HIV\/AIDS, but for preventing further transmission of the disease.\nThe community health workers will work as members of interdisciplinary care teams at medical and support service sites across the county. As trusted members of the community who can relate to the experiences of those they support, community health workers are in a unique position to help people living with HIV\/AIDS overcome barriers to medical care, including stigma, lack of a basic understanding about the disease and available services, and challenges navigating community resources.\nSince 2011, IPHi has trained over 100 community health workers, including approximately 40 who have specialized in providing support to people living with HIV\/AIDS. IPHi, together with its partner Washington AIDS Partnership and over 15 community-based and medical providers, has created over 25 community health worker positions throughout DC, Maryland, and Virginia. Among those are 13 community health workers involved in Positive Pathways, a nationally recognized HIV care model in DC that enrolled over 500 people living with HIV\/AIDS in its first 18 months. Positive Pathways has an intentional focus on the Wards of DC closest to Prince George's County.\n\"The area straddling the border between DC and Prince George's County is one of the most concentrated HIV\/AIDS epidemics in the country,\" said Michael Rhein, President and CEO of IPHi. \"While there are considerable resources available to address the epidemic in DC, community-based systems of care and support for people living with HIV\/AIDS are less developed and integrated across the jurisdictional line in Prince George's County. Total Health Partners will play a critical role in ensuring that county residents have the assistance they need to access life-saving HIV\/AIDS medical and support services.\"\n\"This project is a long time coming for our county,\" said Dedra Spears-Johnson, Executive Director of a community-based organization called Heart to Hand, Inc. \"Too many people living with HIV\/AIDS in the county are not effectively linked to medical care. Total Health Partners will make a huge difference.\"\nAbout the Institute for Public Health Innovation\nThe Institute for Public Health Innovation (IPHi) provides technical capacity, leverages resources, and facilitates collaboration across sectors to develop, implement, and evaluate effective strategies that improve health and quality of life in the DC, Maryland and Virginia region. IPHi is one of the newest institutes within the National Network of Public Health Institutes (NNPHI), an organization of 38 members throughout the United States and a growing aspect of the national public health infrastructure.

{"text":"Impacts of climatic and environmental change on food systems\nPublished: 05 Apr 2014\nFood systems are central to human well-being. We rely on them for nourishment, employment, livelihoods, culture and more. Reliable access to sufficient food is a foundation of human health, and of social and political stability. While the impacts of food systems on the environment are great, changes to the climate and the wider environment \u2014 to which food systems contribute \u2014 also have major implications for the functioning of food systems and all that they support.\nUnderstanding this matters, because sustainable food systems in the future must not only maintain human well-being with fewer environmental impacts, but must also be able to cope to different environmental conditions to those experienced today.\nGHG impacts and mitigation\nThis chapter provides an overview of the following:\nIn what ways do food systems depend on the state of the environment and climate?\nHow are these changing and what impacts of these changes on food systems have been observed so far?\nHow will present and future changes affect food systems going forwards, and what will be the real-terms impacts of these effects for people?\nFood production depends on the availability of suitable land and soils, sunlight, water and pollinating insects, among other things; all of which are or will be affected in different ways by climatic and environmental change.\nThere are many uncertainties surrounding how much and how fast global warming will take place, how this will translate into climatic changes in different locations, and consequently, how changes in climate will affect food systems.\nClimate change is likely to have a mixture of positive and negative impacts on different parts of the food system, depending on the interplay between gradual temperature increase, extreme weather events, the CO2 fertilisation effect, changes in water availability, economic effects (e.g. trade), demographics and infrastructure.\nNegative impacts of climate change on crop production have already been observed \u2013 with some benefits also observed in high latitude regions. Impacts of climate change on terrestrial livestock have not been well-researched yet, but are expected to take place from heat and water stress on animals and animal feed.\nSeparating the impacts of climate change on marine species from those of overfishing is difficult, but ocean acidification and sea temperature changes are likely to compound the negative effects of overfishing.\nExpectations of future crop yields depend strongly on modelling assumptions and the crop, but several models suggest that average crop yield decreases of more than 5% are more likely than not after 2050; and that in the tropics, negative yield impacts are very likely after the 2080s, regardless of which scenario is used.\nThe challenge of meeting additional demands on food systems in the future from population growth and dietary change, will be exacerbated the effects of climate change on food production and will require adaptation action to reduce the level of impacts experienced.\nAs well as production, post-harvest food system activities are also likely to be impacted by climate change. These impacts may include disruption or changes to infrastructure, transport, imports, exports, and sourcing, as well increased risks of spoilage, waste and food-borne diseases.\nWhile some developed countries in the Northern Hemisphere are likely to experience some positive impacts of climate change on production in the first half of this century, many globally traded staple crops are grown in areas that will experience negative impacts with implications on global food security \u2013 especially in lower income countries, those that import food, and on poor farmers.\nA number of major crops have been shown to lose nutritional quality - at least in relation to zinc, iron and protein levels - at higher atmospheric CO2 levels, which may contribute to nutrient deficiencies in some countries, although these relationships are complex and uncertain.\n6.1 How do the climate and environment directly affect the conditions required for food production?\nThis section considers the environmental conditions or factors required for food production, their link to the climate and the environment, and how they will therefore be affected by climatic and environmental change and degradation.\n6.1.1 Land and soils\nRequirements for food production:\nLand: physical space, accessibility\nSoils: sufficient soil organic matter, depth, drainage, aeration and appropriate pH.\nImpacts of climatic and environmental change:\nThe availability of suitable agricultural land is almost synonymous with the availability of suitable soils. In addition to the impacts of soil degradation (see Chapter 5), as the climate changes, and as precipitation patterns alter, the suitability of soils for growing crops is likely to change. For example, drought can lead to dry exposed soils, and may lead to desertification, while extreme flooding can lead to waterlogging, causing anaerobic inhospitable soils.\n6.1.2 Sunlight\nSufficient daylight hours and sufficient light intensity to support crop growth\nWhile daylight hours are outside of climatic and environmental control, the intensity of light reaching crop plants depends on air clarity and weather. Smog and particulate carbon from car and factory emissions is so thick in certain"}
{"text":" parts of the world (e.g. Bangladesh) that the reduction in sunlight reaching crops was sufficient to hinder their growth.\n6.1.3 Water\nGreen water (i.e. precipitation) and blue water (i.e. ground sources of water or aquifers). Sufficient volume for irrigation needs, and appropriate technology and infrastructure for irrigation.\nWater availability (of both green and blue water) depends on volume and frequency of rainfall, as well as on soil drainage, infrastructure and competing demands from non agricultural activities. Projected changes in precipitation, soil moisture, run-off and evaporation across the globe indicate that, at a very rough approximation, places that are currently wet are set to get wetter, while places that are currently dry are set to get drier (both on a climatic scale and in terms of extreme weather events such as droughts and flooding). Both drought and flooding are likely to have negative impacts on crop production, although there are likely to be some regions in which changes in precipitation may bring benefits for food production.\n6.1.4 Insects\nInsects and other invertebrates for pollination, pest control and maintenance of the soil environment (e.g. aeration of the soil, or aiding with the breakdown of organic matter).\nInsect pollinators and other invertebrates providing a range of ecosystem services are known to be under threat from climate change and other environmental influences. Temperature, changing seasonal patterns, and increased or decreased rainfall can all have serious consequences for the animals which provide vital ecosystem services for agriculture. For example: Changing temperatures can affect the emergence times of insect larvae or adult forms, in some cases leading to a loss of synchronicity with the plants they pollinate (whether wild or cultivated), leading to crashes in the insect population, a phenomenon called phenological advancement. The ranges which the insects inhabit may shift as average temperatures rise, leading to changes in the insect communities of particular regions. It is thought that this may have a positive effect on some insect species at mid- to high-latitudes, as warming temperatures decrease their mortality and allow for northward range expansion. Extreme weather events, such as flooding, which are likely to increase in frequency, can also have adverse effects on invertebrates: for example, following severe flooding in the UK in 2007, it was predicted that soil compaction and a decrease in the earthworm population would lead to poorer yields in the following years.\n6.2 What is the climate change context?\n6.2.1 The degree of warming is uncertain.\nThe degree of warming is uncertain \u2013 it depends on the scale of GHG reductions achieved. Even within the IPCC scenarios, uncertainty exists\nIPCC reports identify likely outcomes for different temperature increases resulting from current GHG emission trajectories. A common assumption is that a safe global warming limit is a 2\u00b0C rise in average global temperature, although this is subject to debate and uncertainty.\nThe 2015 climate summit (COP21) in Paris, resulted in reaffirmation by nations that the goal of 2\u00b0C remains, but with a strong signal of intent to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C, in response to calls by vulnerable states (specifically low-lying island nations).\nThe recent IPCC report calculates that GHG emissions reductions of between 40% and 70%, by 2050, will be needed for the 2\u00b0C scenario to be likely. Reducing emissions to zero by 2100 is likely needed to maintain temperatures within this limit.\nThe IPCC report calculates that in order to likely stay within the 1.5\u00b0C limit, GHG emissions will need to be reduced by 70-95% by 2050.\nThis is considered to be a significant technical and socio-economic challenge.\nIPCC terminology\nThe IPCC reports use specific terminology to state its level of confidence in its conclusions and the likelihood of stated outcomes. These are referred to at times throughout this chapter, so a brief explanation is included.\nConfidence is expressed using five qualifiers:\n\"very low,\" \"low,\" \"medium,\" \"high,\" and \"very high.\"\nLikelihood is expressed using probability qualifiers\nAdapted from Mastrandrea, et al. (2010)\nThere is a degree of uncertainty involved in scenario projections, and this mechanism provides a transparent way of understanding the 'firmness' of judgements about outcomes.\n6.2.2 Climate change can affect the food system as a whole.\nClimatic change can impact all forms of agriculture and all stages of food systems\nMeasuring direct impacts of climate change on food systems can be difficult since changes in agricultural practices may happen in response to temperature rise (such as increased irrigation), so altering the impact, together with a lack of a consistent baseline against which to measure change.\n6.2.3 How climate change will affect food systems is uncertain.\nHow climatic change will affect agriculture and food security is uncertain, and depends on many factors\nThere is considerable uncertainty, and impacts"}
{"text":" depend on the interplay between:\nGradual temperature increase.\nThe CO2 fertilisation effect (whereby higher ambient CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere can stimulate increased plant growth and boost productivity, although the strength of this effect is unclear).\nExtreme events such as drought and flooding; temperature peaks.\nEconomics, demographics, infrastructure.\nImpacts will also depend on the degree of climatic change \u2013 i.e. it will vary between a 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase. Scenarios, largely based on models, are used to provide plausible predictions and reduce uncertainty.\nImpacts on agriculture and food security are uncertain, and depend on the interplay between many physical factors such as temperature, CO\u2082 levels, precipitation and extreme events, as well as social, demographic and economic factors, that influence people's ability to adapt to change and may also have an affect on future emissions.\nBoth positive and negative impacts are possible, depending on crop type and the interplay between variables\nCan be positive :\nCO\u2082 fertilisation effect could stimulate plant growth, but crops differ in how they respond to CO\u2082 levels.\nReduced frost (frost can damage or kill many crops).\nPrecipitation (within limits, more rainfall is considered positive for agriculture).\nCan be negative:\nCrops have different optimal temperatures for productivity; increases beyond this can have negative impacts, especially if there are peak temperature days at critical stages in a crop's growth cycle.\nCrops which require vernalisation \u2013 a process in which cold temperatures trigger flowering \u2013 including wheat, may suffer from increased temperatures.\nExtreme changes in precipitation (drought or flood).\nClimate impacts on the yields and nutritional profile of different crops, are not fully understood. There are many variables, such as regional temperature changes, precipitation levels, and seasonal variability. While predictions can be and are made, these involve high levels of uncertainty.\nFor example, in warm dry regions, increased CO\u2082 could boost productivity in C3 plants, but this could be offset by reduced rainfall, higher temperatures or less predictable precipitation, resulting in droughts or floods.\nPlants have different pathways for assimilating CO\u2082 (referred to as either C3 or C4) reflecting differences in the number of carbon atom molecules formed when CO\u2082 is first absorbed. The majority of plants are C3 (such as wheat, rice, and soy) and are believed to respond more productively to higher CO\u2082 levels than C4 crops (such as maize and sugar cane). For more information about the difference between C3 and C4 plants, including efforts to introduce carbon-concentrating mechanisms such as C4 into C3 plants, see the resources available at the Cambridge CAPP website. This variation in response to climate change is just one factor that needs to be considered, alongside changes in precipitation, air temperature increases, and impacts of extreme events such as droughts and floods. The strength of the CO\u2082 fertilisation effect is therefore uncertain and depends on other factors.\n6.3 What impacts have already been observed?\n6.3.1 Regional variation in climatic change impacts on food production.\nImpacts of climatic change on food production have varied between regions\nIPCC (2014)\nSince the IPCC's Fourth Assessment report in 2007 (AR4), impacts of climatic change have been noted across the planet, but with significant regional variation. There is no scope in this chapter to discuss all of these impacts in detail, but the sections that follow describe the complexity of relationships between environmental changes and outcomes for food systems.\n6.3.2 Observed positive and negative impacts.\nSome positive and negative impacts on crops have already been observed\nThe IPCC observed changes include:\n'Medium confidence' of negative impacts on wheat and maize yields in many regions (including major producing regions).\nSmall negative effect on yields for major producing regions of rice and soy.\n'High confidence' that climatic change has benefited some crop yields in some high-latitude regions (e.g. North East China, UK).\nEarly flowering and maturing in some crops (e.g. apples, grapes).\nChanges in the distribution of weeds and animal pests.\n6.3.3 Impacts on terrestrial and aquatic livestock.\nMigration of some fish species has been observed, while research on livestock has been limited\nMarine species\nNorthern Atlantic: \"high confidence\" of a shift in population densities to northern ranges of habitats, away from southern ranges. This is associated with temperature increase.\nOcean acidification \u2013 some negative impact on molluscs (i.e. their shells).\nCombined impact of overfishing and sea temperature changes, negatively impacting corals (and consequential impacts on marine ecosystems).\nIt is difficult to separate the impacts of climatic change from those of over-fishing (see Chapter 5 for more on over"}
{"text":"-fishing).\nVery little research to date on impacts of climate change on livestock production.\nHeat stress for livestock is considered to be a risk, but little research has been undertaken.\nWater stress may also affect animal feed production.\nImpacts will depend not just on the region and animal type and breed, but also the type of livestock production system.\n6.4 How might climatic change affect food systems in the future?\n6.4.1 Climate change is expected to undermine crop yields.\nClimate change is expected to undermine future crop yields, both in the short and long term\nPorter, et al. (2014)\nRegional variability is considerable, though it is expected that negative impacts on average yields will become likely from the 2030s.\nNegative impacts of more than 5% are more likely than not beyond 2050 and likely by the end of the century. From the 2080s onwards, negative yield impacts in the tropics are very likely, regardless of adaptation or emission scenario.\nStudies included in the IPCC reports have used models to identify South Asia and southern Africa as two regions where, without adaptation, there would be very negative impacts on several important crops.\nShorter-term impacts on crop yields are significant because of a projected increase in demand for food in the next 20 years\nGraphs produced by FCRN from data in Lobell and Tebaldi (2014)\nModels predict an increase in the probability of negative yield impacts on key crops (wheat and maize). Two different climate change simulation models were applied, both predicting increased likelihood of crop impacts.\nThis is an important risk, given the expected increase in demand for food between now and 2050 (see Chapter 4 for more on predictions about future demand for food).\nIncreased risk of yield losses due to extreme events, but average yield impacts depend on the CO\u2082 fertilisation effect\nSee earlier in the chapter for a description of the CO\u2082 fertilisation effect.\nModels have predicted that, with full CO\u2082 fertilisation, climatic change will not impact average yields so much as yield variability. There will be much greater risk of yield shocks (current 1-in-200 year shocks increase to more like 1-in-20). There may be a decline in nutritional quality too.\nWithout full CO\u2082 fertilisation, climatic change will impact yields and yield variability to a much greater extent. Yields that today are unprecedented, become freqent in modelling without CO\u2082 fertilisation included.\nGraphs produced by FCRN from data in Lobell and Tebaldi (2014).\nThis shows the absolute need to adapt to climate change to ensure yields are maintained.\n6.4.2 Negative post-harvest impacts should also be expected.\nPost-harvest impacts on food systems must also be considered\nImpacts may affect:\nFood sourcing, processing and distribution:\nDisruptions to transport & stationary infrastructure.\nUnpredictability can lead to crop spoilage & waste.\nFood industry may need to change sourcing decisions.\nThere may be changes in import dependence or export decisions.\nConsumption:\nFood safety problems may increase as temperatures increase or humidity levels change, or because of change in the spread of pests and diseases.\nIncreased use of refrigeration in response to higher temperatures may increase energy use and associated emissions.\nThere may be changes in consumer demand (i.e. less demand for 'cold weather' dishes), which may affect food demand and cooking\/refrigeration demand.\n6.4.3 Increased water stress is expected in various regions.\nClimate change will affect water availability and patterns of water stress\nFCRN (2016)\nWater stress is influenced by the relationship between rainfall, existing groundwater stocks, and water extraction\/replenishment rates. These will be influenced by climate change, which will alter precipitation patterns and the prevalence of extreme events, flooding and drought; and will also affect the demand for water for irrigation.\nMore than 40% of the global population will be living in water stressed regions by 2050\nSource: OECD (2012)\nIncreased water stress is predicted by 2050, especially in river basins with high population densities and increasing water demand. This will include large areas of South Asia, the Middle East, China and North Africa. Over 40% of the world's population will be living in water stressed river basins by 2050.\nOther areas, such as the USA, are predicted to experience less water stress because precipitation is predicted to increase, and because of anticipated gains in the efficiency of water use.\nThe severity of water stress in high risk areas will depend on water management strategies, and there is need for more efficient water management in both agriculture and in other sectors.\n6.4.4 Climate change impacts on marine-sourced foods.\nSea temperature increases and acidification are likely to threaten marine-sourced foods\nCourtesy of NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Programme\nClimate change impacts"}
{"text":" will be felt in marine systems as well as on land. One example of this is the degradation of coral reef systems by sea temperature rises; and by increased CO2 concentrations, leading to ocean acidification. Temperature rises and acidification can lead to coral bleaching, whereby the symbiotic algae on which the coral depend are killed; in turn, affecting the organisms dependent on the coral for food and shelter, leading to a loss of biodiversity and damage to ecosystems.\nCesar, Burke and Pet-Soede (2003) estimated that globally, coral reef systems support US$5.7 billion-worth of fishery activity (note that this economic estimation does not account for coral-reef dependent subsistence fishing). Climate change related coral reef degradation, therefore, has the potential for serious marine food system impacts.\n6.5 What is the likely human impact?\n6.5.1 Who and where will the negative impacts affect most?\nNegative impacts by 2050 will impact poor people more\nAssuming no adaption\nEasterling, et al. (2007)\nSome major global crop and livestock producing regions will experience negative impacts on productivity.\nBased on expert judgement from lead authors of the IPCC reports, in 2007, most of the negative agricultural impact up to 2050 will affect poorer regions. Developed countries, typically in northern hemispheres, are expected to experience some positive impact, at least in the earlier half of the twenty first century. However, from a global food production perspective, many of the staple foods (cereals, grains, etc.) that all populations rely on, and that are traded globally, are produced in areas that may experience negative impacts. Increased climatic variability may be more damaging than gradual changes in temperature, per se.\nHow these impacts affect food security will depend on socio-economic factors and on the policies put in place to adapt to climate change.\n6.5.2 What are the likely nutritional impacts?\nProbable reduction in nutritional quality \u2013 will vary for different crops but the general trend is negative\nMyers, et al. (2014)\nThe study (whose results are shown above), tested changes in nutritional quality for a variety of crops, in field experiments, under conditions of increased atmospheric CO\u2082, finding reductions in nutrients in most cases. Some crops showed less negative (and in some cases, positive) changes, but the nutritional quality of key crops such as wheat, rice and legumes is expected to suffer as a result of climate change.\nNutritional impacts: high degree of uncertainty and complexity\nIncreased concentrations of CO\u2082 have been linked to reduced protein content in some crops (e.g. wheat) and decreases in zinc, sulphur, phosphorus, magnesium, and iron in wheat and barley.\nBut these relationships are very complex and uncertain, and are likely to vary by region, and by crop type.\n6.5.3 What are the likely economic impacts on food security?\nSupply and price volatility will impact food insecure regions and net food importers\nFood security has been defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation as follows:\n\"food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\"\n(see Chapter 7 for more on food security).\nHow might climatic change impact food security?\nCountries who are net food importers are particularly vulnerable.\nLow-income economies that are net food importers could experience significant losses in food access through a double negative effect on:\nreduced domestic agricultural production;\nincreased food prices on global markets.\nAny increases in climate extremes will exacerbate the vulnerability of all food-insecure people, including urban citizens and rural smallholders.\nWith greater food insecurity, people may prioritise securing enough calories over accessing nutrient dense foods \u2013 with negative consequences for micronutrient deficiencies and childhood stunting.\nImpacts of price increases will impact poorer regions more significantly\nPoor people spend more of their budget on food.\nThis means less for education and health, increasing overall vulnerability.\nEconomist (2013)\nThe proportion of income that is spent on food varies widely across countries and within populations, and is linked to inequality of incomes. Populations who spend a high proportion of their income on food are more vulnerable to supply and price changes in food, but additionally have less disposable income to spend on, for example, education and health. They can also be more vulnerable to sanitation risks, lack of safe drinking water and related illnesses. This poverty trap exacerbates health outcomes; poorer populations are more food insecure and more vulnerable to connected health problems. For more on the impacts of poverty on health, in relation to food and nutrition, see Chapter 7.\nHigher food prices could be beneficial to net food producers but many of the world's poorest farmers are actually net food purchasers.\nConditions that determine crop growth are intrinsically liked to the climate and the environment"}
{"text":"; changes are likely to impact on crop growth.\nUncertainty exists about the predicted impacts of climatic change, although some positive and negative impacts are expected.\nThe scale of impact depends on the degree to which climate changes.\nSome changes in crop production and fish migration have already been observed.\nWithout mitigation or adaption, the impacts on food production, overall, are expected to be negative, although regional differences will occur.\nPoorer countries will be affected most because:\nClimate change will affect those regions most severely.\nPoor people and lower-income nations are less able to adapt to changes in climate (e.g. by investing in the necessary infrastructure or training); afford higher food prices; or cope with price and supply volatility.\nADAS UK Ltd and University of Leeds (2013) Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events; Establishing a Methodology for Estimating Economic Impacts on Agriculture.

{"text":"Mendochino fire. Forest Service photo by Cecilio Ricardo (public domain)\nHow Do We Solve Our Wildfire Challenges?\nWildfire expert and Arizona State University professor Stephen Pyne answers five burning questions.\nOctober 4, 2018 - by Tara Lohan\nIf you live in western North America, this summer may have felt apocalyptic at times. California saw its largest fire in state history (outdoing last year's record). Ash from the blaze rained down 200 miles away in San Francisco. Meanwhile, British Columbia recorded its worst fire season, again breaking a record set just the previous year.\nIs this the new normal? Research has shown that wildfire season in the West \u2014 something that should normally be of benefit to ecosystems \u2014 is lasting longer and burning a greater area, affecting people in many communities. At the same time, resources to fight these fires are stretched ever thinner. Climate change in many places will make things worse. And it's not just the western United States that will be affected.\nBut \"firenados\" aside, there's much we can do. Wildfire expert Stephen Pyne says we don't have just a fire challenge, we have many challenges, and we need to employ different solutions. \"Some problem fires have technical solutions, some demand cultural calls,\" he recently wrote. \"All are political.\"\nPyne, a professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University is also the author of numerous books on wildfire including Between Two Fires: A Fire History of Contemporary America and To the Last Smoke, a multi-volume series of regional fire surveys. He also spent 15 seasons on a forest-fire crew at the Grand Canyon.\nWe asked him how we got to this place and where we go from here.\nYou've written that the worsening fire scene we see now can roughly boil down to the Anthropocene as a cause. Can you explain?\nIt's about a fossil-fuel civilization and the world it shapes. Climate change is one factor, but so is how we live on the land \u2014 our transportation infrastructure, our dispersed housing, our kindle-prone powerlines, our passion to replace open flame with internal combustion. Fire is a driverless car, barreling down the road, integrating all the features around it. Most of those, in America, have been shaped by our reliance on combustion as a primary energy source. Burning lithic landscapes now lies over, as well as under, living landscapes.\nWe've come to understand the folly of our century of fire suppression, but how can we now make up for that? How do we get more fire on the landscape given the current state of our forests, budgets and policies?\nThis is not a new revelation. The federal fire agencies and organizations like the Nature Conservancy have spent 50 years trying to restore good fire. The preferred technique, prescribed burning, has worked wonderfully in some places, but has not worked at scale in the West. Instead fire officers are actively managing wildfire to get more acres. The technique is a hybrid of suppression and prescribed fire. It may be the last best hope for much of the West.\nWe often think of wildfire in the United States as a problem of the West, but you wrote that \"the National Association of State Foresters reckons that 79 percent of America's communities at risk lie in the South.\" Why is that region so vulnerable, and what solutions could be utilized to minimize risk there?\nThe West is intrinsically prone to fire in ways that New England is not, and the West holds the vast bulk of public lands \u2014 it gets most of the attention. Particularly where communities are at risk from fire, the prevailing narrative has told of dumb westerners building houses where there are fires.\nBut with changing land use and climate, we're starting to see the fires go to where the houses are. The big burns outside Austin, Texas and into Gatlinburg, Tenn., suggest the narrative may be moving east. Retrofitting the eastern landscape to accommodate wildfire, and creating a powerful fire protection infrastructure, will be much harder in the East than in the West.\nHave you seen anywhere you think fire prevention\/protection and management is being done well? If so, what can we learn?\nThe problem has two parts. One is to protect ourselves from bad fires, the kind that burn into towns, savage municipal watersheds, disrupt ecosystems. The other is to promote more good fire, which can enhance ecological goods and services, reduce fuel loads, and generally dampen the prospects for bad fire and horrific smoke episodes.\nNo one has managed to do both. California is a marvel of fire suppression, but it is locked into a vicious cycle with ever-worsening fires. Florida excels at prescribed fire, burning about 2.5 million acres a year, though its fire agencies admit they need to burn much more. Utah has enacted legislation that grants both aspects legal standing. The fundamental need, though, is to get the right mix for particular places.\nDo we need more science? Are there things we still"}
{"text":" don't know about wildfire and certain landscapes or the impacts of climate change on fire regime?\nThe old formula that science would inform, and management apply, is buckling. Science does not hold a solution, not least because the critical questions are cultural and political, not scientific. More science will not by itself improve the situation, any more than more suppression will. We knew enough a century ago to manage fire.\nWhere science can contribute is to track the changes underway and compare results. The role is less one of visionary CEO, telling us what is natural and what the future should be, than of CPA, recording the consequences of our experiments. A vital role, but not a game-changer.\nTags: 5 Questions | Agriculture | Climate Change | Conservation | Forests | Science | Solutions\nTara Lohan\nis deputy editor of The Revelator and has worked for more than a decade as a digital editor and environmental journalist focused on the intersections of energy, water and climate.

{"text":"Grassroots Internationalism\nBroadening struggles for self-determination and human rights\nIn late February, veteran civil rights, anti-war and labor organizer Eric Mann sat down with Race, Poverty & the Environment to discuss social justice strategies in a global context, and the potential for working class people of color to lead an international movement. Mann is a veteran of the Congress of Racial Equality, Students for a Democratic Society, and the United Auto Workers. He is presently the director of the Labor\/Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles. His latest book is Dispatches from Durban: Firsthand Commentaries on the World Conference Against Racism, and Post-September 11 Movement Strategies (available from www.amazon.com).\nRPE: Transportation justice and environmental justice are some of the primary issues that the Labor\/Community Strategy Center and Bus Riders Union have been working on for the past 15 years. What do you see now as the biggest challenges for working class people of color in Los Angeles? Are they the same as 15 years ago or different?\nEric Mann: The political, economic and social conditions have gotten worse. The right-wing control of the country and the courts is a massive challenge. For example, in 2001 the Scalia\/Rehnquist court, in a 5-4 decision, overturned 30 years of civil rights law in the Alexander vs. Sandoval decision. Sandoval, a Latina from Alabama, sued the department of motor vehicles, arguing that their \"English only\" tests discriminated against her based on race, and was prohibited by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars state and local governments that receive federal funds from discriminating based on race. The federal district court upheld her challenge, and the attorney general of Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court. Instead of dealing with the issue on its merits, the Court used that case to make a radical right-wing argument, i.e. that Congress never intended Title VI to be used by \"private parties\"\u2014civil rights groups, impacted plaintiffs\u2014but only by the attorney general. The majority ruled that private parties could still bring cases if they could prove \"intentional discrimination.\" But it prohibited the long accepted grounds of \"disparate impact,\" a standard by which plaintiffs only needed to document the racially discriminatory impact of a governmental policy regardless of intent. The overturning of the right to bring disparate impact cases challenging environmental racism, and all forms of racism, is a major setback for grassroots groups, low-income people and civil rights law.\nThe second setback for the EJ movement has been the deterioration of white liberal\u2014and I would even say white radical\u2014anti-racism. I am a product of the Black-led mass anti-racist consciousness of the 1960s. But over the last 20 years, I've seen white people turn away from affirmative action, and retreat into the comfort of predominantly or even all-white social structures. In Los Angeles, the Bus Riders Union (BRU) has built a movement of several hundred active members, thousands of on-the-bus supporters\u2014overwhelmingly Black, Latino and Asian\/Pacific Islanders\u2014and a few dedicated anti-racist whites. And yet, we have received virtually no support from \"the White, Westside liberals\" or the white \"anti-globalization movement\" that challenges corporate abuses all over the world but cannot relate to an actual working class, people of color led movement.\nRPE: So how do those two problems that you point out\u2014the right-wing leaning of courts and the decline of white support\u2014affect working class people in Los Angeles?\nMann: Black, Latino and Asian peoples, isolated and under attack, are far more likely to fight back if they feel support from white allies and the federal courts. If you go to court and win, as the BRU did, it reaffirms that the country has a policy to rectify past racism and generates more grassroots activism. But if your case is thrown out of court, and if white liberals turn on you, there's a negative impact on movement building\u2014not irreparable, but significant nonetheless.\nThen we have the third, perhaps most controversial challenge [for working-class people of color], which is the growing hostility of significant segments of the Black and Latino middle and upper classes toward the Black and Latino poor. For instance, in 1994 in Los Angeles, the Strategy Center and Bus Riders Union sued the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transporation Authority (MTA) for running a separate and unequal mass transit system. This system consisted of a dilapidated rail system that served the urban working class (94 percent of all MTA passengers), and a pork barrel suburban rail system that served a far smaller, more white ridership.\nGiven that we won a temporary restraining order to prohibit MTA plans to cut out the monthly bus pass, and eventually won more than $1 billion in new clean fuel buses, you would think that the entire Civil Rights, Democratic Party, and Black and Latino Establishments would have rallied to our cause. Just the opposite. Many"}
{"text":" of them, such as Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, City Councilman Richard Alatorre, Supervisor Gloria Molina, and then-CEO Franklin White were defendants in the case, charged with the racist policies we were challenging. Why? Because the Black and Latino professional classes saw rail construction as a gold mine for contracts to build rail stations; to get minority set asides with larger white construction companies; and for Black, Latino, and women architects to get long overdue government contracts. They wanted billion dollar rail lines even if it destroyed public transportation for 400,000 low-income bus riders of color. So we're starting to see a growing class divide inside communities of color.\nNow here's the good news. Working-class-of-color communities are growing, and occupy the most strategic position in the major urban centers of the empire\u2014New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Oakland\/San Francisco, Houston and Los Angeles. The problem is one of political consciousness and movement building. Can working-class communities of color transition from an objectively oppressed group to a strategically pivotal group in order to lead a broad united front of the entire working class? And then can they lead a national liberation movement of Blacks, Latinos, Asian\/Pacific Islanders of all classes that attracts progressive and anti-racist whites? In our work at the Strategy Center and BRU we target the hotel, garment and service workers; women and children on welfare; and high school and community college students facing overcrowded classes, limited opportunities and police harassment that begins their entry into the prison industrial complex. Our goal is to build a force led by the working class of color that can then re-approach middle class allies. That's why our focus within communities of color is on the working class of color. Over time the Bus Riders Union has built a multi-class and multi-racial alliance, with the working class of color at its core.\nRPE: Anti-racism and anti-imperialism have always been inherent to the Strategy Center's mission. And we're talking about it at Urban Habitat as not just a global challenge, but a challenge at local and regional levels. How do you see imperialism playing out in the lives of the working class communities in Los Angeles?\nMann: We see imperialism as a worldwide system of U.S. monopoly capitalism that begins in the United States and spreads its tentacles all over the world. My reading of U.S. history analyzes the United States as a white settler state based on conquest, genocide against Indigenous people, 300 years of slavery, and the stealing of half of Mexico. This is not \"ancient history\" but the material, cultural and psychological foundation of the United States today.\nSo, when organizers are working in East Los Angeles or Richmond or Fruitvale, [predominantly low-income, people-of-color communities in California], we see how Blacks and Latinos continue to suffer from the policies of imperialism that exploit and oppress them. There are more people in maximum security prisons, kids coming home to apartments that are far more over-crowded, and domestic workers working excruciating hours. Children in Los Angeles are exposed to more air toxins and carcinogens in the first two months of their lives than even the toothless Environmental Protection Agency recommends for a lifetime. So many young kids working at barely-above-minimum-wage jobs, with the system offering them a future as a security guard, prison guard, soldier or prisoner. With rents going up by 10 or 15 percent a year in some areas, the question is, how are these Black and Latino and Asian families living? And the best answer, I understand, is not very well.\nThere are some who see the United States as \"capitalist\" and what it does outside its borders as \"imperialist.\" But imperialism is a unified system; it exists inside and outside the U.S. borders. In my view, the dominant white culture is not just more privileged, but is literally an oppressor nation. As such, Black and Latino peoples, who are now being incarcerated at appalling rates, have the right to equality, and to challenge discrimination and racism. They also have the right of self-determination as an independent oppressed people able to shape their own destiny.\nSo at the Strategy Center, what we're trying to say is, you know who the best allies of the Black, Latino and Korean communities in Los Angeles are? Brazil, China, India, Argentina, Cuba\u2026\nRPE: South Africa?\nMann: Absolutely, South Africa. We think if oppressed nationality working people see their plight and strategic placement in an international context, and see the Third World liberation movements as the main force in the world with which they can ally, those working people can see themselves as part of an international majority movement. This is not \"solidarity work\" that abandons the struggle for environmental justice and human rights inside the United States but rather, a movement that thinks about re-approaching the struggle within the United States from a"}
{"text":" more strategic position with greater leverage and stronger allies.\nRPE: That brings me to your book, Dispatches from Durban, in which you write about South Africa and internationalism. Talk about why you felt that the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) was so important and what the connections are between that and the work you do at the Strategy Center.\nMann: The World Conference Against Racism was a truly amazing experience. Dispatches tries to rescue that experience from an historical \"white-out.\" We had no illusions that the WCAR would pass binding resolutions by nation-states against the crimes against humanity of Europe and the United States. But the resolutions of the non-governmental organizations (rejected by the governments) were very militant, called for reparations, and called for self-determination for the Palestinian people. That's why the United States' [delegates] walked out.\nWhat I saw was the power of anti-racism as an ideology in the midst of a racist world.\nSometimes people in the movement need to look internationally for sources of inspiration, new ideas, and a world where the United States culture is not the dominant culture. Out of the work at WCAR, the Strategy Center initiated a Reparations discussion group, and out of that we formed our Community Rights Campaign to challenge the racism of the Prison Industrial Complex. A year later we returned to South Africa for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and, hearing the horror stories of the Organization of Small Island States and the flooding that threatens their civilizations, we formed our Clean Air, Clean Lungs, Clean Buses campaign to dramatically reduce the number of cars on L.A. roads, and protect the lungs of inner city children and the future of the planet from greenhouse gases.\nRPE: What is the responsibility of people-of-color justice organizers to fight racism and imperialism? How can they think about their responsibility as U.S. citizens?\nMann: As we speak the U.S. war of aggression in Iraq has led to murders of civilians, the torture of prisoners, the deaths of U.S. GI's, ecological disaster, and U.S. GI's returning home mentally and physically ill. The war has diverted more than $150 billion for an occupation of a conquered people while U.S. schools, hospitals, mental health clinics and veteran's administration facilities are falling apart at the seams. Given this context, how can we separate \"international,\" \"national\" and \"local\" struggles? The Strategy Center believes that you can't build a movement in oppressed nationality communities without finding programmatic connections between people's immediate suffering and oppression; a more ideological strategic narrative; a commitment to leadership development and movement building; and an international strategy. Generating on-the-ground campaigns with hard-hitting demands is critical to consciousness-raising, but also to winning real changes in policy.\nThese efforts need to be combined with explicit political education. I have always felt that Black people and Latino immigrants, with whom I work the most, are internationalists at heart. They love talking about Africa. They talk with great emotion about global warming, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, immigrants coming from Mexico to a land that was once theirs, or U.S. interference in the Salvadoran election. When we reported back from our trips to WCAR and WSSD, and when Manuel Criollo and Cynthia Rojas reported back on their recent trip to monitor the elections in El Salvador, our members were thrilled to have the discussions. We find, as organizers, that a more internationalist\/anti-racist\/anti-imperialist politics allows us to recruit and retain members for the long haul.\nRPE: What about the issue of capacity? What are some of the barriers for environmental justice and social justice organizations fighting imperialism?\nMann: One of the greatest contradictions is between the acceleration of right-wing hegemony and the weak state of left movements. On the one hand are the rapid advance of global warming, the rapid pace of deterioration of Antarctica and Samoa, and the massive rise of conspicuous consumption and the SUV culture. On the other hand, there's no comparable growth of a hard-hitting environmental movement that can radically restrict greenhouse gas production. At the Strategy Center, as just one example, we pride ourselves on the growth of our membership, but this work is arduous and exhausting. We're picking up the most dedicated people in fives and tens, and general supporters in the thousands, when the need is for hundreds of thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of people to get involved.\nThe second challenge, I think, is that with the decline of a world Left and the loss of any belief in a master narrative and comprehensive strategy, \"grassroots organizing\" has often been restricted to narrow, issue-based specialties. Each group fights a good fight, but doesn't see itself as part of a broader movement, let alone an international one.\nThe third dilemma is that even at events like the"}
{"text":" World Social Forum, it is hard for U.S. organizers to develop concrete alliances with social movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America. I wish that there was a more clear international campaign\u2014where we could all meet someplace, plan a set of demands, and say, \"you go back to your community to raise these demands against Texaco or Shell or the World Bank, and then we'll meet next year in Rio or Johannesburg, not just for a conference, but for an organizers' movement.\" I'm dreaming of a new Left international, which doesn't exist right now, but which our organization, and this interview, is trying to help bring into being.\nRPE: So what are the next steps? What are some key things that anti-imperialists must do now?\nMann: I think that every grassroots group should discuss what percentage of its time is spent on political education among its members. For example, you can show films such as the Battle of Algiers, one of the greatest revolutionary films, or Rising Waters, about global warming and the effect on the small island nations, and discuss the implications for your work with your members. Haskell Wexler, an academy-award-winning cinematographer, has produced a beautiful 110-minute, feature-length documentary about our work, Bus Riders Union.You can perhaps pick a book, such as Dispatches from Durban, and see if staff members can read and discuss one book together. (Both Dispatches and Bus Riders Union are available at www.thestrategycenter.org)\nAt our National School for Strategic Organizing we offer a six-month intensive political education program. We have the Thursday night group in which we bring guest speakers and reports from international trips. Would it be possible for grassroots groups to set aside one evening a month for political education discussions among key members and staff? Otherwise we run the risk of organizing and activism jumping ahead of any social theory guiding the work.\nAnother next step focuses on demand development. Our Clean Air Campaign is putting forth the demand to reduce L.A.'s 8 million cars to 4 million, which is what I call an agitational demand. Obviously that demand is not winnable in the present, but we're saying that's what needs to happen to achieve a 50-percent reduction in emissions to reverse global warming before human consumption destroys the planet. It's an agitational demand to raise consciousness, and someday it will be turned into an action demand\u2014what we are actually fighting for in terms of social policy. Another next step is to pick certain human rights issues that directly challenge U.S. policy, such as the movement to get the United States out of Iraq, or demanding a full federal investigation and international observers to protest and remedy the recent lynching of Roy Veal, a Vietnam Veteran in Wilkerson County, Mississippi.\nAt the BRU, the planning committee has been working for a year to update our principles of unity and mission statement. After three monthly general membership meetings at which more than 100 members discussed the statement word by word, our statement included the following language: \"We see ourselves as part of an international movement to stop the U.S. government from intervening in the internal affairs of sovereign nations and to support the movements for self-determination inside and outside the United States.\" Practicing what we preach, we have built our organization from the beginning with an internationalist perspective.\n\u2039 Stolen Resources up Impacts, Local and Global \u203a\nReclaiming Our Resources: Imperialism and Environmental Justice\nEnvironmental Justice vs. Empire\nPower of Place and Space\nStolen Resources\nImpacts, Local and Global\nAlternatives and Action\nResources for Reclaiming our Resources\nProject Director and Editor: Jess Clarke\nWeb Editor and Designer: Christine Joy Ferrer\nContributing Editor: Jarrel Philips\nContributing Editor: Margi Clarke\nPodcast Host: Preeti Shekar\nContributing Editors (2014-2017): Marcy Rein, Bob Allen, Eric Arnold, J.

{"text":"A new boost to the push towards carbon neutrality: Free white paper\nTecnon OrbiChem\nJust as Covid-19 ushered in social distancing and further digitised our world by making contactless payment mandatory, Russia's war on Ukraine could accelerate the energy sector's transformation globally.\nIn Europe, both the EU and UK are keen to reduce Russian gas imports \u2013 the EU by two-thirds before mid-2023. On top of plans to limit Russian gas supply, the UK hopes to phase out Russian oil imports before 2022 ends.\nWhile the policies are driven by a desire to dismantle at least some of the means by which Putin retains his power, the move fits the overarching aim of reducing reliance on the carbon-high resource of fossil-based fuel.\nRussia exports around 5 million barrels (bbl) of crude oil daily. At the top end in terms of Europe's appropriation, some 34% of Germany's crude oil came from Russia in 2021, according to Reuters. In 2021, around 8% of Britain's imported oil (Credit: Metro) \u2013 and 3% of the oil entering the US, according to the Wall Street Journal \u2013 came from Russian oil wells. But if we are going to stop paying Russia for our energy, what are the alternatives in 2022 and beyond?\nCarbon neutrality creates opportunity\nA huge part of reducing reliance on the fossil-based resources of oil and gas is accelerating the use of solar and wind power. Existing low emissions energy sources \u2013 such as nuclear and renewables \u2013 will also require fast-tracking if Europe is to meet its own goal of cutting the flow of Russian energy sources across central Europe to the west. Increasing the energy efficiency of homes and businesses is a key part of the equation, as are technologies that are being fully crystalised for real world application today.\nWind and solar\nA framework initiated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees potential for an additional 35 terawatt-hours (TWh) of generation from new renewable projects such as solar photovoltaic and wind power over the next year. To put that number in perspective, a TWh provides enough energy for every UK citizen to make around 500 mugs of tea. The IEA estimates that adding that amount of sustainable energy to Europe's renewables output could cut up to 6 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas use.\nBiogas and biomethane\nWhile not a strategy that can be realised overnight, biogas and biomethane remain promising low-carbon options, according to the IEA. The decomposition of organic waste produces biomethane, a renewable gas with the same characteristics as natural gas. It can also be injected into the grid or used to power buses, as will soon be seen in Spain's Barcelona.\nThe IEA believes the EU could significantly curtail its energy dependency on external supplies by developing and scaling up projects in the biogas and biomethane space.\nIn terms of the EU's domestic gas output, the technology offers important medium-term potential. Earlier this year, the European Biogas Association (EBA) reported that biomethane produced in Europe was cheaper than natural gas. And, for as long as the cost of natural gas is above $5\/mmBTU, biomethane production will likely remain competitive. According to the EBA, it is possible for Germany to generate sufficient biogas to be independent of Russian gas supply by 2030.\nBy rapidly scaling up the production of biomethane across Europe, the association believes that at least 34 bcms of renewable gas could be provided by 2030 \u2013 a further 6 bcms could be produced in Ukraine.\nClean green gas of home\nToday, fewer than 50,000 tons of green hydrogen per year is produced worldwide. However, if the 40 or so presently planned green hydrogen electrolyser projects go ahead, we could see capacities as high as 8 million tons per year by 2030, according to IEA analysis.\nAn example is the Tree Energy Solutions project at Wilhelmshaven in Germany, which, it is estimated, will produce more than half a million tons of hydrogen per year from 2027.\nHowever Europe meets its escalating need for power and fuel, Russia's invasion of the Ukraine has necessitated investment in alternative energy security.\nThis blog post was inspired by Tecnon OrbiChem's Biomaterials and Intermediates senior consultant Doris de Guzman's white paper Will the Russian-Ukraine war trigger more renewable hydrocarbon investments?

She is the first woman president in the history of the global energy organization.\nThe GRC is an international geothermal body that focuses on continuing professional development for its members through its outreach, information transfer and education services.\nRichards has been at the forefront of SMU's geothermal energy research for more than a decade, and the University's mapping of North American geothermal resources is considered the baseline for U.S. geothermal energy exploration. SMU's Conference on Geothermal Energy in Oil and Gas Fields, which she directs, is pioneering the transition of oil and gas fields to electricity-producing systems by harnessing waste heat and fluids.\nHer projects range from computer-generated temperature-depth maps for Google.org to on-site geothermal exploration of the volcanic islands in the Northern Mariana Islands. Along with Cathy Chickering Pace, she also coordinates the SMU Node of the National Geothermal Data System funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.\nRecently, Richards and her colleagues completed a high-resolution shallow Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) potential analysis for the Cascades region of the U.S. Pacific Northwest for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Her other projects include the Eastern Texas Geothermal Assessment, the Dixie Valley Synthesis, and the resource assessment for the influential MIT report The Future of Geothermal Energy.\nShe previously served on the GRC Board of Directors and was chair of the Outreach Committee in 2011-12.

The conference is designed to promote transition of oil and gas fields to electricity-producing geothermal systems by harnessing waste heat and fluids from both active and abandoned fields.\nMore than 200 professionals \u2013 ranging from members of the oil and gas service industry, to reservoir engineers, to geothermal energy entrepreneurs, to lawyers \u2013 are expected to attend \"Power Plays: Geothermal Energy in Oil and Gas Fields.\"\nTopics of discussion will include:\nPower generation from flare gas\nPower generation from waste-heat and geothermal fluids\nResearch updates on induced seismicity, as well as onshore and offshore thermal maturation\nPlay Fairway Analysis \u2013 a subsurface mapping technique used to identify prospective geothermal resources\nTechnology updates\nResearchers from the Huffington Department of Earth Sciences in SMU's Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences will present results from their Fall 2014 Eastern North American Margin Community Seismic Experiment (ENAM CSE) research. In addition, equipment such as one-well systems, desalination and other new technologies will be explored.\nSMU has been at the forefront of geothermal energy research for more than 45 years, and the Geothermal Laboratory's mapping of North American geothermal resources is considered the baseline for U.S. geothermal energy exploration. Geothermal Laboratory Coordinator Maria Richards and Emeritus Professor David Blackwell have seen interest in geothermal energy wax and wane with the price of oil and natural gas.\nBut Richards believes current low oil prices will drive more interest in geothermal development, encouraging oil and gas producers to use geothermal production from existing oil and gas fields as they try to keep them cost-effective for petroleum production at 2015 prices.\nThe technology that will be examined at the conference is relatively straightforward: Sedimentary basins drilled for oil and gas production leave behind reservoir pathways that can later be used for heat extraction. Fluids moving through those hot reservoir pathways capture heat, which at the surface can be turned into electricity, or used downhole to replace pumping needs. In addition, the existing surface equipment used in active oil and gas fields generates heat, which also can be tapped to produce electricity and mitigate the cost of production.\n\"Oil and gas drilling rig counts are down,\" Richards said. \"The industry has tightened its work force and honed its expertise.

Also speaking at the briefing were Karl Gawell, executive director of the geothermal energy association, and James Faulds, professor at the"}
{"text":" University of Nevada-Reno and director of the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology.\n\"This is a crucial time to do this briefing,\" said Blackwell, W. B. Hamilton Professor of Geophysics in SMU's Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences and one of the nation's foremost experts in geothermal mapping. \"Everybody is worrying about energy right now.\"\nThe session was one in a series of continuing Congressional briefings on the science and technology needed to achieve the nation's energy goals, titled collectively, \"The Road to the New Energy Economy.\" The briefing was organized by the National Science Foundation, DISCOVER Magazine, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada was honorary host for the March 27 briefing at the Senate Visitor's Center, which included congressional staffers, members of science and engineering associations, government, private and industry representatives.\nSMU's geothermal energy research is at the forefront of the movement to expand geothermal energy production in the United States. Blackwell and Maria Richards, the SMU Geothermal Lab coordinator, released research in October that documents significant geothermal resources across the United States capable of producing more than three million megawatts of green power \u2014 10 times the installed capacity of coal power plants today. Sophisticated mapping produced from the research, viewable via Google Earth, demonstrates that vast reserves of this green, renewable source of power generated from the Earth's heat are realistically accessible using current technology.\nBlackwell began his presentation by debunking the common misperception that geothermal energy is always dependent on hot fluids near the surface \u2013 as in the Geysers Field in California. New techniques are now available to produce electricity at much lower temperatures than occur in a geyser field, he said, and in areas without naturally occurring fluids. For example, enhanced geothermal energy systems (EGS) rely on injecting fluids to be heated by the earth into subsurface formations, sometimes created by hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking.\"\nBlackwell noted the potential for synergy between geothermal energy production and the oil and gas industry, explaining that an area previously \"fracked\" for oil and gas production (creating an underground reservoir) is primed for the heating of fluids for geothermal energy production once the oil and gas plays out.\nThe SMU geothermal energy expert called these \"unconventional\" geothermal techniques a potential game changer for U.S. Energy policy. Geothermal energy is a constant (baseload) source of power that does not change with weather conditions, as do solar and wind-powered energy sources. Blackwell noted that SMU's mapping shows that unconventional geothermal resources \"are almost everywhere.\"\nBlackwell closed his presentation with acknowledgment that site-specific studies and more demonstration projects are needed to make geothermal energy a strong partner in the new energy economy.\nThe briefing was taped and will be posted to the Science 360 website hosted by the National Science Foundation at a later date.\n> More news from the SMU Research blog at smuresearch.com\nCategories: News, ResearchTags: David Blackwell, Dedman College, faculty research, geology, geothermal energy, green energy, Huffington Department of Earth Sciences, Kimberly Cobb, National Science Foundation, SMU Geothermal Laboratory\nResearch Spotlight: Mapping confirms vast geothermal resources\nPosted on November 17, 2011 Updated: November 17, 2011\nNew research from the SMU Geothermal Laboratory, funded by a grant from Google.org, documents significant geothermal resources across the United States capable of producing more than three million megawatts of green power \u2013 10 times the installed capacity of coal power plants today.\nSophisticated mapping produced from the research, viewable via Google Earth, demonstrates that vast reserves of this source of power are realistically accessible using current technology.\nThe results of the new research, from SMU Hamilton Professor of Geophysics David Blackwell and Geothermal Lab Coordinator Maria Richards, confirm and refine locations for resources capable of supporting large-scale commercial geothermal energy production under a wide range of geologic conditions, including significant areas in the eastern two-thirds of the United States.\nThe estimated amounts and locations of heat stored in the Earth's crust included in this study are based on nearly 35,000 data sites \u2013 approximately twice the number used for Blackwell and Richards' 2004 Geothermal Map of North America, leading to improved detail and contouring at a regional level.\nBased on the additional data, primarily drawn from oil and gas drilling, larger local variations can be seen in temperatures at depth, highlighting more detail for potential power sites than was previously evident in the eastern portion of the U.S. For example, eastern West Virginia has been identified as part of a larger Appalachian trend of higher heat flow and temperature.\nConventional U.S. geothermal production has been restricted largely to the western third of the country in geographically unique and tectonically active locations.\nHowever, newer"}

Preliminary data released from the SMU study in October 2010 revealed the existence of a geothermal resource under the state of West Virginia equivalent to the state's existing (primarily coal-based) power supply.\n\"Once again, SMU continues its pioneering work in demonstrating the tremendous potential of geothermal resources,\" said Karl Gawell, executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association. \"Both Google and the SMU researchers are fundamentally changing the way we look at how we can use the heat of the Earth to meet our energy needs, and by doing so are making significant contributions to enhancing our national security and environmental quality.\"\n\"This assessment of geothermal potential will only improve with time,\" said Blackwell. \"Our study assumes that we tap only a small fraction of the available stored heat in the Earth's crust, and our capabilities to capture that heat are expected to grow substantially as we improve upon the energy conversion and exploitation factors through technological advances and improved techniques.\"\nBlackwell is scheduled to release a paper with details of the results of the research to the Geothermal Resources Council in October 2011.\n> Get the full story from the SMU Research blog\n> Watch a Google.org video on Enhanced Geothermal Systems\nCategories: ResearchTags: David Blackwell, Dedman College, faculty research, geothermal energy, Google, green energy, Maria Richards, renewable energy, SMU Geothermal Laboratory\nFor the Record: May 19, 2011\nRon Wetherington (top right), Anthropology, Dedman College, has been appointed to the State Textbook Review Panel for Supplemental Science.

{"text":"Pollution, erosion, depletion: FAO is alarmed by land and water degradation\nFodder corn harvest near Arzal (Morbihan), September 28, 2020. DAMIEN MEYER\/AFP\nHow to feed a growing world population without depleting the planet's resources? To provide food for thought in the face of this inextricable challenge, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is publishing a report on Thursday, December 9, on the state of land and water resources. Its subtitle, \"Systems on the verge of rupture\", leaves no room for doubt: there is \"Urgency to act\", writes the agency, because \"Unprecedented pressure\" exerted on natural resources, \"Pushed to the limit of their production capacities\".\nThe observation made by the FAO is alarming. \"Overexploitation, misuse, degradation, pollution and increasing scarcity\" : a third of our soils are moderately to highly degraded, according to the UN agency, whose publication completes an already heavy body of work and expertise on the state of land and water. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notably warned in 2019 about the intensive exploitation of resources, which compromises our ability to cope with global warming, but also to ensure our living and subsistence conditions. .\nRead also Article reserved for our subscribers IPCC special report: humanity is depleting the land\nDesertification of the Aral Sea\nAccording to this new FAO study, South Asia is the region most affected by land degradation linked to human activities, with just over 41% of its area affected (excluding desert areas). But looking at the geographic distribution in absolute terms, sub-Saharan Africa alone is home to a fifth of degraded land, followed by South America (17% of this land).\nWater resources are not doing any better: 10% of the capacities coming from rivers and aquifers are taken, of which more than two thirds are for agriculture, mainly for irrigation. \"The current patterns of agricultural intensification are proving to be unsustainable\", FAO writes. Li Lifeng, director of the agency's land and water division, details in World these pressures: \"Certain agricultural practices, such as irrigation, cause erosion and promote salinization of the land. Today, 10% of arable land is threatened by the accumulation of salts. The intensive use of plastics, chemical inputs and fertilizers also has perverse effects on soil quality \", Mr Li continues. Effects which are cumulative, and to which is added global warming.\nAs a reminder of the severity of the threat, the FAO cites, among other examples, the drying up of the Aral Sea: once one of the largest lakes in the world, located between six countries of Central Asia, notably the Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, this area was the victim of massive plans to divert water in the 1960s to irrigate cotton crops, until it became a virtual desert.

This is a deep recession, deeper than at the beginning of the 1990s,\" he told a news conference after a monthly meeting of ministers from the countries sharing the single currency.\nThe European Commission forecast on Jan. 19 that the euro zone economy would shrink 1.9 percent this year. The European Central Bank, however, forecast last Thursday the contraction could be between 2.2 percent and 3.2 percent.\nThe bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.5 percent, the lowest level ever, to support sagging demand amid waning inflationary pressure.\n\"Since the January 19 forecasts, downside risks have increased,\" EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told the news conference.\n\"There are problems on one hand concerning the situation in credit markets with very low flows of credit and tightening of credit conditions, and on the other hand with weakness of the real economy,\" he said.\n\"In other areas, external demand has weakened so the recovery will take longer than we expected a few months ago.\"\nAlmunia said he now believed a gradual recovery would take place only in 2010 rather than late 2009 as forecast earlier.\nBut the euro zone finance ministers rejected calls from the United States to boost the fiscal stimulus packages already announced in the 27-nation European Union, which currently amount to between 3 and 4 percent of EU gross domestic product.\n\"Europe and the Eurogroup have done what they needed to do.. we take the view that we don't need to make a further effort for the moment.

{"text":" Contraction continues in India's exports, which in January fell by 15.9% compared to January of 2008. Experts are already speaking of the worst crisis in decades, while government initiatives are not showing concrete effects.\nExports in January totaled 12.3 billion dollars, compared to 14.7 billion one year ago. But what is especially worrying is the rapid deterioration in the figure, after the decline of 12.1 in December of 2008 and 9.9 in November of 2008. India mainly exports textile products, clothing, jewelry, and other manufactured products. A drop in orders from abroad will have serious effects on employment. The Federation of Indian Exporters Association expects a loss of at least 10 million jobs in the export sectors by March 31.\nImports have fallen by even more, down by 18.2% in January. Experts predict that exports will remain low for a number of months, as a result of lower foreign demand, especially from the United States and Europe.\nThe main concern is that government efforts to foster exports, including tax breaks and incentives for the hardest hit sectors, seem to be having no effect. New Delhi has announced robust investments to support production: in January, it announced investments to support production, employment, and infrastructure totaling 200 billion rupees (4 billion dollars) for 2009. But it has difficulty providing further subsidies, because it has to deal with a budget deficit estimated at 11.4% of gross domestic product.\nThe Indian economy grew by 5.3% in the third quarter of the fiscal year (from October to December), compared to 8.9% in the same period in 2007. It expanded by 7.6% in the quarter from July to September of 2008. It is the lowest rate in six years, after three consecutive years of growth above 9%. The result has disappointed expectations that the country might be more resistant to the global crisis because it has an economy aimed mainly at production for domestic demand.\nAnalysts observe that the real rate of growth is even lower, since the estimate is based on the previous year. In reality, in the past quarter the manufacturing sector saw a decline of 0.2%, and agricultural production dropped by 2.2%. About 60% of the 1.2 billion inhabitants live in villages of less than 5,000 people, with an economy that is primarily agricultural, and experts are still uncertain about the effects this crisis will have on them.\nAlso worrying is the effect on the many people living in poverty: in February, the World Food Program of the United Nations estimated that 220 million people in the country are still suffering from hunger, with 56% of Indian women anemic, and about half of the children underweight.\nGovernment forecasts maximum 4 per cent growth. Exports decline, pushing up unemployment. In August 2008 almost 10 million people were jobless, a number bound to rise. Finance minister calls for urgent measures to check currency depreciation.\nJakarta (AsiaNews) \u2014 With sharply decreasing exports and troubled credit loans, Indonesia is now facing a possible recession. Economists from the Bank of Indonesia (BI), Indonesia's Central Bank, have warned that economic growth might not exceed 4 per cent in 2009.\nThe downturn in the economy is due to a variety of factors, first of all the drop in exports, down by 30 per cent between January and April, mostly in commodities and manufacturing items.\nAccording to Toto Dirgantoro, the secretary general of the Association of Indonesian Exporters, orders from importing countries has sharply decreased for a wide range of Indonesian products including crude palm oil, rubber, textiles, garment, footwear, fishery product and furniture.\nUnemployment has mirrored declining exports, rising to 9.39 million people in August 2008. and due to ailing economic growth, the figure is feared to be rising again.\nFalling prices have led China and Pakistan to cancel contracts signed last year.\nThe Indonesian Textile Association reported slower exports, consequence of a sharp drop of 20 per cent this year from US$ 10.48 billion.\nThe textile industry is the country's largest employer with an estimated 3.5 millions workers in more than 4,500 factories.\nThe Indonesian Statistics Bureau (BPS) recorded fewer foreign orders in January with a drop in 17.7 per cent. It was the biggest month-to-month decline in more than 22 years.\nThe most significant component to suffer from decreasing export volume was oil and gas exports, which fell by 23.85 per cent, whilst non oil-gas exports decreased by 16.67 per cent.\nIndonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani expressed concern about the impact on the value of Indonesian rupiah, down 12.033 against the US dollar.\nHe urged the Bank of Indonesia governor to intervene to protect the national currency and avoid further depreciation.\nMeanwhile Indonesia was able to secure US$ 5.5 billion in loans from Australia (US$ 1 billion), Japan (US$ 1.5 billion), the World Bank (US$ 2 billion) and"}

How many cities here in the United States? Could a similar attack happen in Seattle or San Diego, Miami or Manhattan?\nThese were the questions posed by FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III in an address before the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C. last week.\nMuller said that the terrorist attacks that killed more than 170 and wounded more than 300 others in Mumbai three months ago \"reminds us that terrorists with large agendas and little money can use rudimentary weapons to maximize their impact\" and that \"the simplest of weapons can be deadly when combined with capability and intent.\"\nMueller warned that while the United States continues to face threats from al Qaeda, we must also focus on lesser-known terrorist groups\u2014particularly extremists from 'visa-waiver countries,' who are \"merely an e-ticket away from the United States.\"\nIn the aftermath of September 11th, the United States was principally focused on al Qaeda, Mueller said. He emphasized that our primary threat continues to come from the tribal areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan but noted that \"we are seeing persistent activity elsewhere, from the Maghreb and the Sahel to Yemen.\"\nThe FBI is increasingly concerned with pockets of people around the world that identify with al Qaeda and its ideology although they have little or no actual contact with\u2014or connection to\u2014al Qaeda. Mueller went on to say that there is a real threat from \"homegrown\" terrorist activities, and that a balance must be struck between acting early to disrupt a plot in its planning stages, and \"continuing to investigate until we are certain that the individuals in question are poised to attack.\"\n\"In each of the plots the FBI has disrupted since September 11th,\" Mueller said, \"some have asked whether the individuals in question had the intent and the capability to carry out their plans. Take the planned attack against Fort Dix, for example. The men we convicted had engaged in target practice in the woods of Pennsylvania. They had watched Al Qaeda training videos. They had a map of the base, and a plan to get in. And they had purchased semiautomatic weapons from an FBI sting operation.\"\nLike the attackers in Mumbai, the men who plotted to attack Fort Dix wanted to inflict as much damage as they could, Mueller said.\nWhile the FBI continues to work closely with intelligence partners around the world, Mueller said that the agency is redoubling its efforts here in the United States. He said that part of that effort involves breaking the barriers that exist between law enforcement and the community it serves, particularly within immigrant communities where young men are likely to become indoctrinated and radicalized and then carry out attacks either here or overseas.\n\"Too often, we run up against a wall\u2026based on myth and misperception of the work we do. We know that the best way to tear down that wall is brick by brick, person by person. Yet we understand the reluctance of some communities to sit down at the table with us.

Bush as a post-9\/11 gesture of solidarity. Then, there were the successive affronts during the visit by Blair's successor, Gordon Brown, to Washington last week: A seemingly thoughtless official gift (a set of DVDs of popular American films); a painfully chilly and brief press availability before the start of the two men's private meeting; and no formal joint press conference of the kind Bush afforded Blair on all but one of numerous visits to Washington (the exception a hastily arranged trip right after the September 11 attacks).\nThe British press has offered several face-saving explanations for these serial rudenesses. Perhaps Obama is \"exhausted.\" Alternatively, he is simply \"focused elsewhere\" in the midst of cratering capital markets, collapsing automakers and skyrocketing unemployment.\nThe real answer, however, was supplied by an unnamed State Department official whom London's Sunday Telegraph reported on March 8th \"reacted with fury\" when asked by the paper why the Brown visit was so, er, \"low-key.\" According to the Telegraph: \"The official dismissed any notion of the special relationship.

To help close the home ownership gap among Muslim immigrants, the state's housing agency has launched a new program offering Islamic mortgages.\nIslamic law does make exceptions to the ban on interest, if one's family is at stake. But the exceptions are open to interpretation and for many observant Muslims, conventional mortgages are strictly taboo.\nNawawi Sheikh is one of them. The Somali-American said he and his wife just couldn't go against their beliefs, even if it meant giving up their dream of owning a home. Still, he grew tired of moving from one rented apartment to another.\n\"One thing I hated was moving. I don't like to move all the time,\" he said.\nHe has no plans to move again anytime soon. Sheikh is the first home buyer to get a loan through the state's New Markets Mortgage Program. That's because, program manager Nimo Farah said, he has all the makings of a successful homeowner.\n\"I had lots of applications, but he's the first one, because really, he was ready. He has been working at the same job for quite a while; he took care of his credit; he had the right size family, and he had all his documents together,\" she said. \"He was basically ready to go.\"\nThe program is targeted at low-to-moderate income families. Qualified applicants have to complete first-time home buyer education classes. The goal is to help Muslim home buyers build wealth and reap the benefits of home ownership.\nHere's how the mortgage, known as Murabaha financing or \"cost plus sale,\" works:\nThe state buys a home and resells it to the buyer at a higher price. The down payment and monthly installments are agreed to up front at current mortgage rates.\nThe deal is identical to a thirty-year fixed-rate loan, except there's no additional interest, because the higher up-front price factors in payments that would have been made over the life of a traditional mortgage.\nA handful of private banks and lending institutions offer Islamic mortgages in the U.S., but Minnesota Housing is the first state agency to offer such a product. The program is the brainchild of Hussein Samatar, director of the African Development Center in Minneapolis.\n\"The process is different, but the outcome will look the same,\" Samatar said. \"We wanted to be as conventional as possible, while respecting the tenets of Islam.\"\nSamatar, who used to work for Wells Fargo, tried for years to launch Islamic financing. He said the fact that Minnesota Housing has agreed to participate is a nod to the Muslim community's growing economic power.\nChicago-based Devon Bank is underwriting the loans for the New Markets program. Devon is one of the largest Islamic lenders in the country. Corporate Counsel David Loundy said he expects the demand for Islamic financing to grow as more Muslims make their home in the U.S. Loundy said Muslims tend to be good risks.\n\"If they worked so hard to get to this country, they don't want to screw it up now that they are here, so they tend to pay their debts pretty promptly,\" said Loundy. \"In addition, you have a population that is religiously and culturally predisposed against having debt, so they"}
{"text":" want to pay down their debts as quickly as they can.\"\nThe numbers back this up. In its five and a half years offering Islamic lending, Loundy said Devon Bank hasn't lost a penny, though he admits the recession could make that record difficult to sustain as more borrowers face job loss.\nBut the bad economy is also offering opportunity. With housing prices at rock bottom, officials say the timing couldn't be better to match first-time Muslim buyers with foreclosures that need new owners.\nNawawi Sheikh's new three-bedroom south Minneapolis home is a former foreclosure. The African Development Center's Hussein Samatar said there are thousands more potential buyers like Sheikh out there. He said the New Markets Mortgage Program will help the Minnesota Muslims community put down strong roots.\n\"It is great news for the country, and it really sends a great signal that the United States is our country,\" he said.\n\u2014 Hat tip: islam o'phobe [Return to headlines]\nBarack Obama may soon be known as the Teleprompter President as his dependence on his teleprompters get more notice every day.

{"text":" seize control of apartment buildings, stadiums, ships, trains or buses. As in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, texting and mobile email would make it easy to coordinate simultaneous assaults in a single city.\nIn the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, strikes on New York City and Washington, D.C., these were hypotheticals no more. They became real scenarios for which responsible civilian and military leaders had to plan. The possibility of such attacks raised difficult, fundamental questions of constitutional law, because they might require domestic military operations against an enemy for the first time since the Civil War. Could our armed forces monitor traffic in a city where terrorists were preparing to strike, search for cells using surveillance technology, or use force against a hijacked vessel or building?\nIn these extraordinary circumstances, while our military put al Qaeda on the run, it was the duty of the government to plan for worst-case scenarios \u2014 even if, thankfully, those circumstances never materialized. This was not reckless. It was prudent and responsible. While government officials worked tirelessly to prevent the next attack, lawyers, of which I was one, provided advice on unprecedented questions under the most severe time pressures.\nJudging from the media coverage of Justice Department memos from those days \u2014 released this week by the Obama administration \u2014 this careful contingency planning amounted to a secret plot to overthrow the Constitution and strip Americans of their rights. As the New York Times has it, Bush lawyers \"rush into sweeping away this country's most cherished rights.\" \"Irresponsible,\" harrumphed former Clinton administration Justice Department officials.\nAccording to these critics, the overthrow of constitutional government in the United States began with a 37-page memo, confidentially issued on Oct. 23, 2001, which concluded that the September 11 attacks triggered the government's war powers and allowed the president to use force to counter force. Alexander Hamilton saw things differently than critics of the Bush administration. He wrote in Federalist 74: \"The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength, and the power of directing and employing the common strength forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.\"\nCongress agreed with Hamilton. Restrictions on deploying the military for domestic law enforcement (originally passed to end Reconstruction in the South) did not apply to self-defense of the nation. Congress blessed military action on Sept. 18, 2001, when it authorized President Bush \"to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" connected to the September 11 attacks, \"in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States.\" Passed as the sound of Air Force combat air patrols flew over the Capitol, Congress must have understood that its words included stopping domestic attacks, since the hijacked airliners of 9\/11 took off and crashed on American soil.\nThe government faced another fundamental question, which we addressed in our memo. Does the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a search warrant based on probable cause regulate the use of the military against terrorists on our soil. In portraying our answer, the media has quoted a single out-of-context sentence from our analysis: \"First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully.\"\nThis line deliberately misrepresents the memo. The sentence only summarized a 1931 holding of the Supreme Court in the case of Near v. Minnesota concerning press freedom: \"When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.\" The Court continued: \"No one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops.\"\nOur memo had nothing to do with the First Amendment. It only referred to the case to show that constitutional rights apply differently during the exigencies of warfare than during peacetime. The 1931 case bolstered a point that the Supreme Court recognized in 2000 in Indianapolis v. Edmond, striking down random traffic stops to search for illegal drugs. \"The Fourth Amendment would almost certainly permit an appropriately tailored roadblock set up to thwart an imminent terrorist attack,\" the Court wrote. Courts have understood that law-enforcement standards could not govern military operations against wartime enemies. They have rejected, to take one example, claims that the Constitution required compensation for the destruction of oil facilities before the invading Japanese in World War II.\nImposing Fourth Amendment standards on military action would have made the Civil War unwinnable \u2014 combat occurred wholly on U.S. territory and enemy soldiers were American citizens. The military does not have the time to obtain warrants before soldiers fire upon enemy targets and personnel; the battlefield does not provide the luxury to collect evidence needed to meet probable cause standards in civilian courts. Even if the Fourth Amendment applied, we believed that courts would judge military action under a standard of \"reasonableness\" \u2014 as they might review a police officer who fires in self-"}

Mr. Mouammar, a defender of Hamas and Hezbollah, two groups on Canada's terrorist list, recently called Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, a \"professional whore\" over his support for Israel. Ottawa has threatened to cut the group's funding.\nMr. Mouammar sent the e-mail to about 20 Arab organizations across Canada at the end of last week, in a bid to marshal forces against the alleged campaign.\n\"The Zionist campaign is being waged by the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith supported by some politicians,\" his e-mail said, adding that the movement \"was developed after the Lebanon war of July, 2006, to suppress all criticism of Israel and equate it with anti-Semitism.\"\nSince Mr. Mouammar's assumption of leadership of the CAF, the organization has taken a more hardline stance on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The federal government now considers it a mouthpiece for anti-Semitism and unworthy of receiving public funding. The CAF had frequently worked with Jewish groups on issues of mutual concern in the past.\n\"This e-mail, by specifically naming the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith, again shows he does not just disdain Zionists, but the Jewish community as a whole,\" said Alyhhan Velshi, a spokesperson for Mr. Kenney, who did not receive a copy of the e-mail.\n\"It's the ugliest, most vile sort of language.

This was a once-proud organization that has turned into nothing but a group whose sheer focus seems to be to attack Jews and Israel.\"\nIn the e-mail, Mr. Mouammar called for an emergency conference to bolster a strategy to confront the alleged campaign. Mr. Mouammar told the National Post that a statement will soon be released to the media.\nThe e-mail contains what appears to be a working version of this statement, referencing \"Islamophobia\" and expressing concern over Mr. Kenney's \"inflammatory remarks\" which have \"inflamed a campaign to marginalize and demonize the already targeted Arab and Muslim Canadian communities.\"\nThe e-mail, which singles out the two Jewish groups, Mr. Kenney, and the National Post, states that the alleged campaign has targeted other organizations including CUPE Ontario, CUPW, and the Canadian Federation of Students.\n\"The campaign of intimidation launched by the Israeli lobby and their supporters is seeking to de-legitimize Arab Canadian institutions, services, access to public funds and to silence all criticism of Israel,\" the e-mail said.\nThe message concluded with a call to the Prime Minister to \"restrain\" Mr. Kenney and \"put an end to his dangerous campaign of attacking CAF with slanderous and damaging accusations for which he has provided no evidence.\"\nMohamed Bechari (President of the FNMF) talks to Marco Cesario\n\"Friday prayers should be said in two languages, in Arabic and in the language of the country in which Muslims live.

This didn't of course stop it predicting that 2009 will be one of \"the top-five warmest years on record\".\nUS climate sceptics such as those on the Watts Up With That website, for whom the predictions of the UK Met Office have become a regular source of amusement, recalled its forecast that 2007 would be \"the warmest year on record globally\", just before global temperatures dived by nearly a full degree Celsius, cancelling out the entire net warming of the past 100 years.\nEver wilder wax the beleaguered warmists in their rhetoric.

According to the Chamber's predictions, 400million euro will be lost through lost energy savings and EU fines for violating C02 emissions laws, as Sunday Mail reportd. ETEK has called on the government to apply a proper energy-saving policy as soon as possible so as to ease the blow. Regarding delays in supplying the island with natural gas, ETEK projects the most conservative scenario, which is that Cyprus will lose 12 million euro for each year's delay. In total, Cypriot consumers will be called to pay at least 48 million euro. In an announcement on Friday, the Chamber explained that the initial plan was to have natural gas in Cyprus by 2009. This date was expanded to 2013 and recently, when the government started taking real action to prepare the grounds for its arrival, state officials said it could even be 2015. And it doesn't end there. If the state had applied its policy for buildings' heating insulation in time, it would have saved 150 million euro.

Indeed to buy off peace, Pakistani authorities allowed the imposition of Sharia (Islamic law) in the Swat valley.\nHow long the cease-fire Swill last is anyone's guess. But Pakistan has allowed a precedent that could extend to other provinces; in fact the Swat valley is only about 100 miles away from Islamabad, the capital.\nBut Sharia is not just making inroads in Pakistan but actually creeping in the West \u2014 particularly in Europe.\nOne area especially touched by this phenomenon is the judicial system in Europe. Two recent cases in Italy and France are particularly troublesome. First, in Italy, three members of a Brescia-based Maghrebi family (father, mother and eldest son) were accused of beating up and sequestering their daughter\/sister Fatima because she wanted to live a \"Western\" life.\nIn the first trial, the three were sentenced for sequestration and bad treatment. The court acknowledged that the teenager was \"brutally beaten up\" for having \"dated\" a non-Muslim and in general for \"living a life not conforming with the culture\" of her family. But on appeal, the family was acquitted because the court deemed that the young woman was beaten up for \"her own good.\" The Bologna public prosecutor's office then disputed the acquittal of the"}
{"text":" three accused parties, but the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed it and ruled in favor of the charged parties.\nInterestingly two Italian political leaders on the opposite side of the political spectrum, Isabella Bertolini, vice president of the MPs of the right-wing party Forza Italia, and Barbara Pollastrini, a post-communist former minister agreed to condemn the Supreme Court decision: \"This verdict writes one of the darkest pages of history of the law in our country.\"\nIsabella Bertolini was upset that the court \"allied itself with radical Islam\" and Barbara Pollastrini is pushing for parliament to pass as soon as possible a law condemning violence against women: \"Now more than ever, it is urgent to defend the rights of a large number of immigrant women victims of an intolerable patriarchal culture.\"\nMuslim women were quick to denounce the supreme court's decision. Among them, Souad Sbai, president of the Organization of Moroccan Women in Italy.\nShe said, \"It is a shame, this verdict is worthy of an Arab country where the Sharia would be in vigor. In the name of multiculturalism and respect of traditions, the judges apply two kinds of rules: one for the Italians and one for the immigrants. A Catholic father that would have acted this way would have been severely sentenced.\"\nAccording to her organization, recently at least nine Muslim women have been killed in Italy by one of their close relatives. The number of young girls forced to wear the hijab \"as early as eight or 12\" is on the rise as is the number of female teenagers fleeing home and \"lots of them are looking to flee to France.\"\nBut France might not be the panacea either. Indeed in one very publicized case, last June, a French judge ruled in favor of a Muslim man who wanted the annulment of his marriage because his wife turned out not to be a virgin. What this decision amounted to was the endorsement of the repudiation concept.\nThis decision triggered a huge outcry from politicians, and various organizations. In November, a French court of appeal overturned the decision. Interestingly, a large majority of French Muslims, about 80 percent are very secular and totally reject any kind of Sharia law being implemented in the homeland of human rights.\nBut the United Kingdom is a different story, indeed there close to 40 percent of young Muslims are in favor of Sharia law being implemented in Britain. The idea seems to be also making headway among non-Muslims. So, last year, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, gave his support for the courts in Britain, saying that the legal recognition of them \"seems unavoidable.\" He added, the United Kingdom has to \"face up to the fact\" that some of its citizens do not relate to the British legal system.\nWilliams argued that adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law would help maintain social cohesion. For example, Muslims could choose to have marital disputes or financial matters dealt within a Sharia court.\nBut contrary to what Williams advanced, Sadiq Khan, a British Muslim MP said that Sharia courts would discourage Muslims from developing links with other cultural and ethnic groups. He feared also that women could be \"abused\" by Sharia courts, which may give unequal bargaining power to the sexes.\nIn Switzerland, echoing Williams, Christian Giordano, an anthropology professor at the Fribourg university wrote that a special jurisdiction for Muslims could be envisioned in Switzerland. He added that including elements from Islamic law could allow to better manage the multiculturalism issue. Other occurrences of Sharia law taking precedence over the law of the country have been reported: For example, in Denmark, some imams have allegedly sentenced delinquent Muslims, hence bypassing Denmark's judicial system.\nIslamists, much to the detriment of the majority of Muslims in Europe seem to be making headway in Europe in pushing Sharia law into the judicial system.\n(ANSAmed) \u2014 MADRID, MARCH 4 \u2014 The Superior Court of Justice of Madrid has ruled that the removal of the equestrian statue of Francisco Franco from Nuevos Ministerios Square in the Spanish capital null and void.

The cross was inscribed with the names of people who faced the firing squad during the civil war for religious reasons. The cross was removed on Tuesday in accordance with an order that had been unanimously approved by the town hall in full session. The municipality, governed by a Isquierda Unida\/Psoe coalition, applied the Law on heritage. The order provides for the \"removal, in all public spaces, of any remaining symbols of Franco still existing in the municipality\". The municipality, which counts 6,500 inhabitants, experienced tense moments when a substantial group of citizens attempted to oppose the removal of the cross by stepping between the monument and the large vehicles sent by town authorities. In the end, with the help of a police line, the operation was carried out and the cross was removed to a town storage unit. On December 14, according to a press release by the archbishopric cited by Efe agency, the order to remove the symbol was notified to church authorities, with the remark that the cross was standing \"in the public path located right next to the church\". According to the archbishopric, \"the removed monument can in no way be construed as an exaltation, be it personal or collective, of the military uprising, the Civil War, the dictatorship or even of Franco's repression\", as provided by the law. Hence the complaint against the town authorities was filed with the Guardia Civil, and the archbishopric reserves the right to exercise 'any legal recourse that it may deem necessary''.

On the one hand it supplied Nazi Germany with iron ore and ball bearings and allowed the Wehrmacht to use the Swedish railway system to transport soldiers. On the other hand, spurred on by the Danes, it accepted Danish Jews marked for mass murder by the Nazis. Ultimately, the good name of Sweden was redeemed by the unparalleled heroics of one of its own \u2014 Raoul Wallenberg, who, using the cover of a Swedish diplomat, helped save tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews destined for Auschwitz, only to disappear into the Soviet Gulag.

{"text":" even have heard of the Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel, taking place this weekend in Malm\u00f6, if it wasn't for the \"Stop the Match-Boycott Israel\" campaign which has been underway since December. The campaign organizers are doing their best to mobilize thousands of demonstrators to Malm\u00f6 this weekend and according to Malm\u00f6 police chief, H\u00e5kan Jarborg Eriksson, some extremists have stated that they want to \"stop the match at any cost\".\nLike it or not, sporting events are part of our culture and official matches between national teams often become political events. This is particularly true in Sweden. Many Swedes were in favor of boycotting the Olympic Games in China, for example. Others wanted to boycott the 2006 Football World Cup because it promoted prostitution and human trafficking in Germany. The Davis Cup itself has also been a source of controversy in the past. When Sweden played Rhodesia and Chile in the late sixties and early seventies there were many calls for cancellation and mass demonstrations were organized.\nMany sports fans may object to it, but in reality sports and politics are both part of the public arena, and cannot always be separated. In a democracy people have the right to mix them together, to demonstrate and even call for boycotts. Still, municipal officials are expected to live up to their minimal responsibilities even in the face of an angry crowd. This is the reason that the decision made by Malm\u00f6's sports and recreation committee, to hold the Israel-Sweden match behind closed doors is so outrageous.\nAccording to Bengt Forsberg, chairman of the committee, there was no political motive behind the decision. Though police had said the match could go ahead and that the public could be admitted, Forsberg's committee decided not to take the chance. \"This is absolutely not a boycott\", he explained, \"We do not take political positions on sporting events. We have made a judgment that this is a high-risk match for our staff, for players and for officials\". In other words, someone made a threat and the city of Malm\u00f6 decided to cave in.\nTo many this may seem reasonable at first sight. Why take unnecessary risks? If there are concrete threats, it could be claimed, everything must be done to avoid casualties. But in this age of terror and violence where does this end?\nAnyone who has been anywhere near a Stockholm derby football match, for example, couldn't miss the extensive police presence. Policemen on foot, on horse and in helicopters above try to maintain the peace, at an enormous cost to the tax payer, while large groups of drunken young men throw objects at the field, terrorize other spectators and get involved in large scale fights. The authorities, quite rightly, have decided time and again to fight hooliganism and protect peaceful football fans. It is, after all, a basic civil right to engage in sporting activities without being subjected to threats and violence. There has been talk of anti-hooliganism legislation, and the National Council for Crime Prevention even proposed treating hooliganism as organized crime. But in the case of the tennis match in Malm\u00f6, the combative rhetoric disappears and the ones who are punished are the fans instead of the hooligans. Why is this?\nOne explanation is that Mr. Forsberg and his committee aren't being entirely honest or they may be extremely na\u00efve. Despite their claims, any decision at this level is political. Obviously, no one will stop the money making and extremely popular football league because of threats. In this case, freedom and democracy will prevail against the dark forces of violence. But when it comes to a tennis match against Israel the attitude changes. Mr. Forsberg obviously doesn't care much about a match against a team from a country that a large part of his constituency hates anyway. I wonder if the good citizens of Malm\u00f6 would approve of banning fans from a Malm\u00f6 FF game because someone said he's so pissed off that he might hurt someone.\nAt the risk of being accused (yet again) of promoting paranoid theories of Anti-Semitism I'll add the following point: after giving in to threats such as the ones made by angry Anti-Israel demonstrators, why shouldn't the City Council of Malm\u00f6 close down the Jewish cemetery and synagogue since they were already attacked and are definitely at a high risk of being attacked again? Why shouldn't pro-Israel demonstrations be banned since demonstrators are often met by angry stone-throwing mobs? In fact, why shouldn't local authorities close down the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm or the Jewish centre in Helsingborg, both of which have recently been attacked?\nThis scenario may have sounded unrealistic a few months ago, but the decision to ban the public from the Davis Cup match shows that it is more than possible. A few Jewish or Israeli targets may not affect most Swedes but it's a slippery road. If a few threats on a relatively minor sporting event can empty a 4,000 seat arena, just imagine what a real terrorist attack would"}
{"text":" do to Swedish society. Would a terrorist attack on a local bus close down the public transport system? Will night clubs and restaurants lose their licenses if they are targeted by terrorists? Will municipalities say they prefer not to risk going on with daily life even when the police clearly say they can handle the work load? Regardless of political convictions, there must be a consensus that a modern freedom loving democracy has to protect itself against violent extremists. In the post 9\/11 world, perhaps it's time for local authorities to realize that the times, they are a'changing.\nAnother explanation for Malm\u00f6's City Council decision may derive from the very nature of the objections to the match. It's a discriminating decision that is a result of a discriminating campaign. Make no mistake, \"Stop the match \u2014 Boycott Israel\" is a legitimate campaign. I don't agree with what they say or with their political allies but no one can take away their right to express their objections to Israeli policies or to publicly sympathize with the Palestinians in Gaza. It's true, some of them have said terrible things and spread vicious lies (such as comparing Israel to the Nazis); some have actively supported terrorist organizations, but their right to express themselves remains. Still, anyone who wants to see the bigger picture should be careful with boycotts. They are seldom effective and tend to end up hurting the wrong people, and although it is tempting to make comparisons to boycotts like the one against South African apartheid, the analogy is wrong.\nThe conflict in the Middle-East is nothing like that in South Africa and a boycott policy against one side in it is simplistic at best and biased, unbalanced and hypocritical at worst. This is not to say that Israel cannot be criticized, but Swedes should be careful when using a tool as powerful as boycotts. Sweden had no problem participating (and winning twenty medals) in the 1936 Berlin Olympics under Hitler or participating in the Beijing games despite China's massive violations of Human Rights. Hundreds of demonstrating students were killed by government forces just days before the 1968 Mexico-City Olympic Games, but that didn't \"Stop the Match\" for Swedish athletes just like the British soldiers who shot unarmed civil right activists in Derry, Northern Ireland didn't bring about any boycotts against English products or English cultural and sporting events. Does this make the calls for boycotting the Davis Cup match against Israel invalid? Of course not. But it would imply that Israel is worse than Nazi Germany and that Israeli policies brought about events more severe than the Irish Bloody Sunday, the Mexican Tlateloco Massacre and the events of Tiananmen Square all combined! It is clear what kind of people make claims like this.\nAnd here's one last thought for the demonstrators in Malm\u00f6 who must be very proud of the exposure their campaign has received these last couple of months. They gained support, their case is all over the media and they even forced local officials to close the controversial match to the public. But here is a word of advice: don't be too pleased with Malm\u00f6's decision to give in to threats. The same authorities that cannot stand up to today's threats will not stand up to those of tomorrow. What started as threats against tennis players and fans could easily lead to threats by ultra nationalists against immigrants or Neo-Nazi threats against Mosques and Madrasahs. \"The ultimate weakness of violence\", Martin Luther King once said, \"is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it\".\n[Comment from Tuan Jim: Is this likely to have the desired effect or simply to increase the welfare rolls?]\nIn an effort to boost Sweden's birthrate, the Christian Democrats are considering a proposal that would pay families 10,000 kronor ($1,085) for every newborn child.\n\"There are simply too few children being born and that's regrettable,\" said Anders Sellstr\u00f6m, a member of the Christian Democrats' governing board, to the Svenksa Dagbladet (SvD) newspaper.\nSellstr\u00f6m also leads a working group within the party tasked with formulating a revised family policy ahead of the 2010 parliamentary elections.\nAccording to figures from Statistics Sweden (SCB), 109,301 children were born in Sweden last year.

Turkish-born Dogan, now in Broadmoor, claimed a bird had spoken to him telling him to carry out the attacks.\nOn 23 December 2004, between 8am and 9am, he killed father-oftwo Ernest Meads, 58, and stabbed five others around Tottenham, Wood Green and Edmonton.\nHe admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was found guilty of attempting to kill five others in March 2006.\nA report into Dogan's treatment is due to be published today as a result of pressure from the victims and their relatives.\nThe inquiry into Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust and Haringey Teaching Primary Care Trust is expected to reveal a number of opportunities missed by health professionals which could have prevented the stabbings taking place.\nDogan had been well known to mental health services. He had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2000 after suffering \"persecutory and grandiose delusions\" of being touched by spirits.\nSix weeks before going on his rampage, Dogan attacked his mother at their home and the family tried to get help from social services."}

One, our collapsing economy, he knows about, although it is not certain what he plans to do about it. To the other, however, he seems totally oblivious.\nThere is no secret about the fact that within a few years Britain will be faced with a terrifying and unprecedented shortfall in its electricity supplies. All but one of the nuclear plants which provide a fifth of our power are so old they will have to close. Nine more major coal and oil-fired power stations are rapidly running out of the hours they are allowed to remain open by Brussels.\nThe combined output of these plants is 22 gigawatts (GW). At peak demand we need 56GW. We thus face a 40 per cent shortfall in the supply needed to keep our economy functioning. There is no way that gap can be filled in time by new nuclear plants. Building more gas plants, when we are fast running out of our own gas and prices are likely to soar, all the experts agree is crazy.\nSo what does Mr Cameron propose? There is no more alarming gap in Tory thinking than the complete vacuum that represents their energy policy. For three years they have indulged themselves making \"green\" noises about the need for a \"low carbon economy\", \"smart meters\", more wind turbines, without giving any indication that they have the slightest practical knowledge of where our electricity actually comes from.\nThis was devastatingly brought home in January 2006 when the media were summoned to watch Mr Cameron and his shadow cabinet colleagues sitting in front of laptops to sign up with \"green electricity\" suppliers. Clearly they imagined that if you sign up to a \"green\" tariff, all your power will somehow come from nice eco-friendly windmills and solar panels. In fact it all still comes through the National Grid, where the derisory amount of power from windmills just gets mixed in with all that \"dirty\" electricity from grown-up power stations.\nMr Cameron himself signed up with a company called \"npower juice\", which boasts that it gets most of its power from a windfarm off the north Welsh coast. The deal is fine for npower, which makes \u00a39 million a year in subsidies from its turbines through selling Renewable Obligation Certificates, on top of much the same from the electricity itself. But most of the power entering Mr Cameron's home via the grid is no more \"renewable\" than anyone else's.\nFrom the electricityinfo website we can actually see the sources from which supply companies derive their power. Npower gets 38 per cent from coal, 46 per cent from gas, only 3 per cent from renewables. Mr Cameron's energy adviser Zac Goldsmith, also present in 2006, happily explained that he is signed up with Ecotricity, which likes to boast that it is the \"greenest\" of all supply companies. But even Ecotricity only derives 37 per cent from renewables, the remaining two-thirds coming from nasty, polluting, ungreen coal, gas and nuclear.\nThe point of this story is that it reveals the almost fathomless naivete of the Tory leadership about one of the two most serious issues which will confront them if they come to power. They babble on about the wind turbines which very intermittently provide barely 1 per cent of the electricity we need and are unlikely ever to produce significantly more. But they show not a glimmer of grasping the scale of the crisis now roaring down on us, let alone give any sign they have an answer to it, Unless they grow up very fast on this issue, Mr Cameron could go down in history as the man who left Downing Street shortly"}
{"text":" after the lights went out.\nA Muslim police officer claims he was forced out of his job by colleagues who made fun of his beard and called him a 'f***ing Paki'.\nPC Javid Iqbal, 38, said white officers openly discussed in front of him how they were'better' than their ethnic-minority colleagues.\nThe married father of two also claims officers pulled faces at each other if told they had to go out on patrol with him and forced him to walk home from a job instead of picking him up.\nPC Javid Iqbal: 'My beard is an important part of my identity'\nMr Iqbal says he was sacked after fellow-officers in Luton launched a'smear and witch-hunt campaign' during which they lodged a string of complaints about his performance.\nHe is taking the Bedfordshire force to an employment tribunal claiming he is the victim of racial and religious discrimination and unfair dismissal.\nThe claims will add to concern about institutional racism in police forces.\nAn employment tribunal in London recently heard evidence that an 'apartheid culture' was operated at Belgravia police station, with separate vans for white and black staff.\nMr Iqbal, who was born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, told the Daily Mail: 'My beard is an important part of my identity which helps other Muslims relate to me.\n'I am disgusted that I was bullied by other officers because of my beliefs. I became a policeman because I believed in putting something back into society.\n'I have found that institutional racism is still very much around.'\nMr Iqbal was working in Hertfordshire County Council's finance department when he became a special constable for the Bedfordshire force, one day a week.\nFollowing the 7\/7 bombings in London in 2005, he volunteered to go on patrol every night after work for two weeks to help reassure the large Muslim population of Luton, who were concerned about revenge attacks.\nIn October that year he was accepted on to a training course to become a full-time constable.\nHe says the first racist incident came in early 2006. He claims he was in a van with seven PCs and three 'tutor' constables \u2014 including one other Muslim \u2014 which stopped for food at a shop which did not sell halal products. When he asked if they were stopping anywhere else, he was told: 'This is it.'\nOne officer allegedly mimicked his accent and pretended to have a beard similar to his in an'offensive' incident.\nMatters worsened in September 2006 when eight officers presented 'negative statements' to superiors about Mr Iqbal, including an allegation that he failed to help a colleague arresting a violent offender.\nHe said he was cleared the following June when CCTV showed he was dealing with other people at the time.\nBut relations with fellow officers hit a new low in February 2008, three months after he officially lodged his grievances. A sympathetic officer told him the document had been left in the duty room where anyone could read it.\nSubsequently, he said, an officer had openly referred to him as a 'f***ing Paki'.\nMr Iqbal had only recently returned to work after a ninemonth leave of absence on full pay owing to depression when he was sacked for poor performance in August last year. He says he was the victim of untrue allegations, such as failing to report a rape claim. He insists the woman complained only of harassment at the time.\nMr Iqbal's wife, Surhya, 30, a preschool headmistress, said: 'Javid has gone through depression quite badly. There were times when he was asleep continuously for three days. Previously, I felt if something was wrong we would be able to rely on the police. Now I know how it works on the inside I've lost faith.'\nA source at Bedfordshire Police claimed Mr Iqbal was sacked because he was 'not cut out to be a police officer'. A spokesman added: 'We can't comment on a case that is yet to be heard but the evidence will speak for itself.'\nAlmost seven million adults have maths skills below the level of the average 11-year-old, a worrying survey has found.\nConsistency demands that Hizbollah's spokesman be banned from entering Britain.\nAs The Sunday Telegraph reports today, the Government has yet to decide whether it will allow Dr Ibrahim Moussawi into Britain to give a talk at the University of London next month. Dr Moussawi is a spokesman for Hizbollah, the Islamist group responsible for a string of kidnappings, murders and bombings in Lebanon, and for violent jihad against Israel. He has yet to apply to the Home Office for permission to enter Britain for next month's lecture, but he has applied for, and been granted, a visa to visit this country twice before.\nNot surprisingly, there have been some profound objections raised to allowing him into Britain again. Baron"}
{"text":"ess Neville-Jones, the Conservatives' security spokesman, has noted in a letter to the Home Secretary that there should be \"no double standards\" on extremists, a view echoed by Douglas Murray, the director of the Centre for Social Cohesion. The Government, having banned Geert Wilders, the Right-wing Dutch MP who compares the Koran to Hitler's Mein Kampf, from entering Britain, should not allow Dr Moussawi to come here.\nAs defenders of the right to free speech, we take the view that it would be better that both individuals should be allowed to speak in Britain, rather than that neither should. However, the objectors to Dr Moussawi are correct when they say that consistency in the application of the law is essential to its credibility and its justification. There can be no consistent justification for the Home Office allowing Dr Moussawi into Britain after it has prohibited Mr Wilders.\nInconsistency of that kind, however, seems likely. The Government has demonstrated before that it is reluctant to antagonise some of the more vociferous sectors of the British Muslim community. There was a particularly blatant example of that kind of behaviour two weeks ago, when the Charity Commission published its report into whether a London-based Palestinian charity, Interpal, had violated the rules governing charitable status. The report resulted from a BBC Panorama programme which alleged that Interpal donated money to causes linked to Hamas, the group designated as a terrorist organisation by the European Union. The BBC programme's claim that Interpal donations were ending up with organisations affiliated to Hamas was emphatically denied by Interpal, but apparently confirmed last year by the US Treasury: it stated that the \"Union of the Good\" \u2014 a coalition of charities of which Interpal is part \u2014 \"facilitates the transfer of tens of millions of dollars a year to Hamas-managed associations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\"\nAnd yet the Charity Commission, despite a two year investigation, simply declined to scrutinise that evidence \u2014 although it would not merely breach charity guidelines if Interpal was donating money that found its way to Hamas: it could even be a criminal offence. Instead, the Commission contented itself with suggesting to Interpal that it \"dissociate\" itself from the Union of the Good. The contrast with the way the Charity Commission treats other British charities \u2014 private schools, for example \u2014 where a smallest infraction of the code is sufficient to generate the immediate threat that charitable status will be withdrawn, is obvious. The Commission insists it is not influenced by ministers. It is difficult to believe, however, that in this case, the importance to the Home Office of not offending a large and powerful part of the Muslim community did not dictate the outcome of the investigation.\nThis approach discredits the Government and it discredits the law. No group in Britain has the right to special treatment. We hope that, in future, the Government applies the law consistently and fairly to everyone.\nSome schoolchildren think the Nazi death camp Auschwitz was a brand of beer, a religious festival or a kind of bread.\nOne in seven people believe it is acceptable in some circumstances for a man to hit his wife or girlfriend if she is dressed in \"sexy or revealing clothes in public\", according to the findings of a survey released today.\nA similar number believed that it was all right for a man to slap his wife or girlfriend if she is \"nagging or constantly moaning at him\".\nThe findings of the poll, conducted for the Home Office, also disclosed about a quarter of people believe that wearing sexy or revealing clothing should lead to a woman being held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted.\nAlthough a majority of 1,065 people over 18 questioned last month believe that it is never acceptable to hit or slap a woman, the poll found that those aged 25-39 were more likely to consider that there were circumstances in which it was acceptable to hit or slap a woman.\nMen and women over 65 and those in the lower social class groups D and E are more likely to believe that woman should be held partly responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted, Ipsos Mori telephone poll found.\nJacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said: \"Violence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form no matter what the circumstances are.\"\nMs Smith said that more needed to be done to challenge attitudes that condoned violence against women and girls.\nShe was speaking as she launched a police lead review of whether new laws are needed to tackle serial domestic violence abuses and whether there is a link between the early sexualisation of young girls and violent abuse.\nOne idea being considered is to allow women to ask police if a new partner has a record of domestic violence.

If the plan goes through, the number of settlers in the Territories will double. Peace Now has said that there are to be a total of 73,300 housing units, 15,000 of which have already been authorized. The movement added that thousands of homes are to be built in the E-1 zone between Jerusalem and the Maaleh Adumin settlement in the West Bank, in the direction of Jericho. The plan has given rise to alarm within the Palestinian leadership, since in its opinion the project would bring in a de-facto separation between the northern and southern parts of the West Bank. In an interview with the military radio station, Peace Now leader Yariv Oppenheimer said that if the plan were to be authorised and carried out, then \"it will no longer be possible to build a Palestinian state\" in the Territories. However, Peace Now believes that it is still possible to put a halt to the plan while the latter is still undergoing the necessary bureaucratic procedures. The Ministry for Construction claims that Peace Now has not understood the information which came into its hands, and said that for all Israeli territory plans for potential development are drawn up for the following ten years, and that the settlement plans in question had existed for a number of years. Whether they are actually carried out (even in partial manner) or shelved is a government prerogative.

According to reports in the Israeli press today, the 17 year-old boy had jokingly recited the Hebrew ritual wedding vows before his girlfriend, and even put a wedding ring on her finger in front of two witnesses. It was intended to be a joke, but it ended up being a real wedding, since the Rabbi experts declared that the wedding was valid to all purposes, especially as the wedding' was consummated afterwards by the young spouses.

Nevertheless, the rate of infant mortality in Turkey remains four times higher than the OECD average of 5.2\", OECD said in a report titled \"OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Turkey Compare\". Life expectancy rates have increased in Turkey in recent years, narrowing the gap with the average across OECD countries, but not surpassing it. In 2006, life expectancy in Turkey was 71.6 years, just seven years less than the OECD average while this gap was 20 years in 1960. Among the problems in the Turkish health care system noted in the report were a low-level of health care spending and a low number of physicians per capita, both of which were the lowest seen in the OECD. Turkey also has fewer nurses than many other OECD countries, with 2.1 nurses per 1,000 population compared to an OECD average of 9.7. According to the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of Turkey, Professor Mehmet Ceyhan, the activities of \"infection control committees\" established at State hospitals two years ago have not developed to the desired level and this plays an important role in the spread of infectious diseases.

They have never believed in egalitarianism, economic opportunity, religious tolerance, and self-criticism. They have used medieval forces of governance: tribalism, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, authoritarian traditionalism, and most recently Islamic fundamentalism. Arab schools and universities turn out more graduates in Islamic studies, falsified history, and void nationalism than in science, engineering, and medicine. Critical studies and scientific research have screeched to a halt. The majority of Arab professors translate works and research done in the West and claim they are their own. Empirical work is almost non-existent. Students graduate without having the slightest clue about what is really going on in the Western world. The only things the majority of them know about the West is that it produces good car, but it is decadent; people drink much alcohol and women sleep with everybody.\nBillions of barrels of oil, fertile land along the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates valleys, which in the past helped creating great civilizations, yield an excess of misery rather than riches like in North Korea or Hong Kong, for instance. Billions of dollars are squandered on armament and a lavish life-style enjoyed by corrupt despotic rulers of the Arab world and their affiliates. Totalitarian oil rich Arab grandees from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Emirates, and Qatar, who plunder their countries' resources, invest their billions of dollars in the West. Countries like Egypt and Jordan, which receive billions of dollars as aid from the America and Europe, spend the money on strengthening their regimes.\nTragically, prospects of improvement are dismal. Arab government spokesmen and the predominantly state-owned media entertain the illiterate and semi-literate population with anti-Western and anti-Israel propaganda.\nThe Arab media are a great charade and a simulacrum of the West. They lack life-giving spirit and self-criticism. The state-controlled media and the private ones, owned by rich Arabs affiliated to Arab regimes, like the Saudi tycoon Al Waleed Bin Talal, give the appearance of being modern and Western. But their reporters and anchormen and women are by no means journalists by Western standards of free and truthful inquiry.\nFor example, while BBC makes a point of talking to the victims of a suicide bomber in Baghdad and Kabul,"}
{"text":" al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, and the other Arab TV stations would never interview the mother of an Israeli blown apart by a Palestinian terrorist. To add insult to injury, Arab journalists call Palestinians who clash with Israeli forces and die: Martyrs.\nMost Arab television stations would never broadcast freewheeling debates, like Meet the Press style talk show permitting criticism of the government, or critical, liberal interpretation of Islam. Commercial TV stations quibble over a high degree of anti-Americanism and anti-Israelism and obfuscate criticism of official Islam.\nCreative novelists, cartoonists, and bloggers like Najeeb Mahfouz, Salman Rushdie, Flemming Rose, and Alaa Fattah received death Fatwas (ruling) for blasphemy. Four Egyptian editors of four Egyptian newspapers, Ibrahim Issa, Adel Hammouda, Wael el-Ebrashi and Abdel-Halim Qandil were sentenced to a year's hard labour for offending the president, Hosni Mubarak. Instead of getting a prize for literary creativity and civic courage, critics receive a prison or death fatwa and a mob at their courtyard.\nNo wonder that a culture of zero-creativity and silence is pervading the Arab world. On the other hand, a culture of demagogy is spreading across the Arab world. Prime examples are the Islamist preacher Amr Khaled and the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darweesh. The Arab current furor is scripted, whipped up, and mercurial.\nThe Arab regimes and their media focus on and exaggerate the number of Arabs killed in clashes with the Israeli army and the coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, they deliberately ignore the thousands of Shiites, and Kurds butchered by Saddam Hussein and Hafez Asad of Syria.\nThe murder of some100.000 Muslims in Algeria by fellow Muslims, not by infidels, did not provoke so much indignation and violent demonstrations among Muslims as the so-called \"Mohammed cartoons\" did, although according to the holy Koran, \"If someone kills a human being, it is as if he had killed the whole mankind.\"\nAll the conferences held in the Arab world about alleged Western bias and media distortion, and all those open-letters signed by Muslim leaders to Christians for dialogue cannot hide the self-inflicted catastrophe \u2014 and the growing ostracism and suspicion towards Arab regimes and evil forces in the Middle East. The Arab-Muslim message: \"You accept our Shari'a or die\" will never be accepted by the world community. The gloat over that Islam is engulfing the world is mere self-deception, vulgar and hallucination, at best. What is engulfing the world is extremism and terrorism. And the world will never accept a religion that approves of bloodshed and carnage.\nYet, in sum, Arab regimes remain objectively powerful, at least in one respect, not because of greater courage, higher IQs, or stronger economy, but because of their unique skills in cultivating fanatics and breeding terrorists. The cultivated West has not yet been able to find an antidote to the culture of terrorism. That is an area where Arabs and Muslims have proved to be superior.\n(CNN) \u2014 A Saudi Arabian court has sentenced a 75-year-old Syrian woman to 40 lashes, four months imprisonment and deportation from the kingdom for having two unrelated men in her house, according to local media reports.\nAccording to the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan, troubles for the woman, Khamisa Mohammed Sawadi, began last year when a member of the religious police entered her house in the city of Al-Chamli and found her with two unrelated men, \"Fahd\" and \"Hadian.\"\nFahd told the policeman that he had the right to be there, because Sawadi had breast-fed him as a baby and was therefore considered to be a son to her in Islam, according to Al-Watan.

Recently, UNICEF claimed that the LTTE has intensified its recruitment work in recent months, and released figures according to which, from 2003 to 2008, the rebels forcibly enlisted at least 6,000 adolescents. The figures provided by the UN agency confirm the repeated accusations from various organizations of civil society on the island, and the various Christian Churches of Sri Lanka.\nReferring to the UNICEF data, Rajapaksa's government accuses the rebels of instituting a genuine \"Baby Brigade,\" and says that 6,288 children under the age of 18 had been enlisted by the LTTE as of December of 2008. The Tamil Tigers respond to Colombo by saying that they have sent home more than 2,000 adolescents among their ranks, and accuse the army of recruiting minors itself, and using them for paramilitary brigades. The Catholic Church and organizations of civil society in the country assert that 60% of the combatants in both factions involved in the conflict are children with an average age of 16.\nPYONGYANG\/BEIJING, March 9 (AP) \u2014 (Kyodo)\u2014North Korea warned Monday that any move to intercept what it calls a satellite launch and what other countries suspect may be a missile test-firing would result in a counterstrike against the countries trying to stop it.\n\"We will retaliate (over) any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counterstrikes by the most powerful military means,\" the official Korean Central News Agency quoted a spokesman of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army as saying.\nby Wang Zhicheng\nAccusations of separatism against the Dalai Lama and the Uyghurs.

That said, it is still likely that some individual supporters of the Dalai Lama may take the risk of making reckless moves.\" Qiangba Puncong has continued to criticize the Dalai Lama and his government in exile, saying that they constitute a threat to stability in the region. Today, foreign minister Yang Jiechi also accused the Dalai Lama of not being \"by any means a religious leader, but political,\" who is seeking to \"separate Tibet from China.\" Yang also criticized those countries that invite the Tibetan religious leader. \"Other nations,\" he said, \"should not permit visits by the Dalai, and should not permit him to use their territory for secessionist activities.\"\nFor years, the Dalai Lama has reiterated his desire to return to Tibet, asking only for cultural and religious autonomy in order to save the Tibetans from cultural genocide, but Beijing accuses him of separatist activities. In recent weeks, the Tibetan religious leader has often said that he is concerned about the increasing tension in Tibet, which could lead to clashes and more deaths and arrests, as happened last year. This year is also the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan revolt in 1959, which was suffocated with military repression and led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. \"It's necessary to increase the number of the armed police, police, firemen, border forces and public security,\" Qiangba Puncong says.\nIn Xinjiang as well, where the Uyghur community is asking for greater autonomy, Beijing is providing extra military control. This year, China wants to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the \"peaceful liberation\" of Xinjiang, with the entry of the Chinese army into the region. But many Uyghurs see this as an invasion. Yesterday, again during a study group at the NPC, the governor of Xinjiang, Nur Bekri, said that \"the task of security will be more arduous, and the struggle more fierce in the region this year.... It's a time of celebration for Xinjiang people, but hostile forces will not pass on such an opportunity to destroy it.\" Last year, in order to prevent \"terrorist attacks\" at the Olympics, Beijing arrested more than 1,000 Uyghurs.\nBut personalities of this Muslim ethnicity accuse the Chinese government of being insensitive to the group's basic economic necessities. According to Ilham Tohti, professor of economics at the central university for the nationalities in Beijing, the most serious problem for the Uyghurs is unemployment. This is due to the marginalization of the group from administrative structures and state industries, and to the policy of colonization, which every year transfers thousands of Han Chinese to the region. In an interview with Radio Free Asia, Tohti accused Governor Behkri of insensitivity toward the Uyghurs: \"He's always stressed the stability and security of Xinjiang and threatened Uyghurs. Xinjiang has developed, but the people are living in poverty, especially Uyghurs.\"\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union as a superpower, we in the United States became complacent, at least to a certain degree. I think we have forgotten what it is like to live each day knowing that there is a nation on Earth working just as diligently against our interests as we work for them. In the post-Cold-War era, that nation is communist China. The battlegrounds on which we prosecute a not-so-cold war with China are not proxy conflicts in third-world nations; they are the twin fields of endeavor most vital to continued human progress. These are technology and industry.\nAnyone familiar with the state of contemporary manufacturing is familiar with how things are done in China. From photocopiers to pocket knives, anything and everything that can be made is made by Chinese manufacturing facilities. For the longest time, the factor holding the Chinese back in the world market was the critical issue of quality control. The Chinese have largely overcome this, however, and now an American company farming out its manufacturing to China can essentially pay for the level of product quality it desires. The Chinese will simultaneously, quietly copy anything and everything submitted to them for manufacture, of course; this is expected and even tolerated, if not appreciated.\nWEBSITES are selling fake state-of-the-art Australian passports for as little as $1250, boasting they'll pass the most rigorous border checks.\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says the sites are just another money-making scam but admit they are \"the subject of ongoing discussions'' with Australian Federal Police.\nDFAT also warns that people who use such documents are guilty of a serious criminal offence.\nOne of the sites boasts it is a unique producer of quality fake documents.\n\"We offer only original high-quality fake passports, driver's licences, ID cards, stamps and other products for following countries: Australia, UK, USA,'' the site says.\nSample pictures of a blank Australian passport show where buyers' personal details will be entered after supplying"}

So said the President of a victims' group, Sy Abou. According to human rights NGOs the clashes caused hundreds of deaths among the black-African population, including soldiers accused by the then President Maaouiya Ould Taya (1984-2005) of planning a coup d'etat against his regime. Sy Abou said that a report containing the requests of the victims' group had been passed to the President of the Higher State Council (the junta in power), General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, and that the General \"is commited to finding a speedy solution which meets our requirements\". Several Ulema (Muslim scholars) and Islamic rights specialists worked with the group, giving them \"their moral support for a fair solution\", according to Sy Abou; the victims are asking in particular for a recognition of the actions on the part of the State and moral and material compensation for the victims. \"The procedure risks being extremely long in terms of getting a full and definitive agreement, which is why we decided to propose rulings in stages, starting with compensation for widows and orphans\", he added, saying that requests for the construction of a memorial to the victims and the exhumation of their bodies were declared inadmissible by the Muslim religion and had therefore been abandoned by the collective.

Although cases from the Middle East represented only a tiny fraction of his overall caseload, the 68-year-old orthodox Christian, who was born in Palestine, also accepted each claim he heard against Israel during the period, while the rest of the IRB accepted just 10% of Israel claims.\n\"I would like to see some close scrutiny of who this fellow accepted because his numbers are off the radar"}

Obviously no one was monitoring his performance because he was there for 10 years,\" said Martin Collacott, a former diplomat who follows immigration and refugee issues for the Fraser Institute.\nAlykhan Velshi, spokesman for Jason Kenney, the Minister of Immigration, said the government acknowledges those concerns.\n\"Without knowing the full details of the individual cases, I can't comment beyond saying that the numbers speak for themselves,\" Mr. Velshi said.\n\"I think it's fair for Canadians to ask why Mouammar's acceptance rate was so much higher than the IRB average for the same countries, as well as whether he was letting people in who he shouldn't have.\"\nWhen contacted at home, Mr. Mouammar referred all questions to the IRB. \"I have nothing to add to that,\" he said. A spokesperson for the IRB said the board did not comment on the performance of past or current members. \"However, statistics on individual acceptance rates cannot be used to draw conclusions or inferences.\"\nMr. Mouammar has found himself in hot water in recent months because of his support for Hamas and Hezbollah. The CAF advocates both be taken off a list of banned organizations because they are \"legitimate political parties,\" while it considers Israel a genocidal regime, guilty of \"war crimes.\"\nMr. Mouammar also hit the headlines for calling Jason Kenney, the Minister of Immigration, a \"professional whore\" over his support of Israel, a move that prompted Mr. Kenney to say he intends to review the CAF's public funding.\nThe Post reported this week that Mr. Mouammar spent much of the late 1990s and early 2000s sitting on the refugee protection division of the IRB. He was appointed when Sergio Marchi was the Liberal immigration minister in Jean Chretien's first term in 1994 and reappointed on four successive occasions.\nSources have forwarded statistics on the number of cases he handled during that period and the number of refugees that were admitted to Canada as a result.\nIn his first few years with the IRB, the norm was for two or three members to sit on a panel and hear refugee cases. In those years, Mr. Mouammar heard 912 cases, recording an acceptance rate of 50%, compared to an IRB average of 30%.\nOne person who heard cases alongside Mr. Mouammar on the refugee board said that when he presided over a case, he routinely accepted claims, and it was only when the other member presided that he would agree to deny claimants.\nAfter the IRB streamlined the hearing process to one member, Mr. Mouammar's acceptance rate rose dramatically. Of the 1,092 cases he heard on his own, he accepted 88%, compared to a 49% average for the rest of the IRB. When it came to cases from Algeria, Iraq, Israel, Morocco and Tunisia, that number rose to 100%.\n\"My conclusion is that, statistically, you definitely wanted him in the room with you if you were from Algeria or Iraq, or if you were making a claim against Israel,\" said immigration policy analyst and lawyer Richard Kurland.\nMr. Collacott noted that Canada accepts three times as many refugees as most other countries.\nOne third of people moving from abroad are returning Finns\nfull 94 per cent of Finnish municipalities are getting more inhabitants coming from abroad than they lose to emigration. \"Immigration seems to be the key anchor of population development in the 21st century, at least in many municipalities\", says population researcher, Dr. Timo Aro. Aho was asked by Helsingin Sanomat to analyse what impact immigration has had on individual municipalities between 2000 and 2008. He used data from Statistics Finland as his resource material. The immigration statistics also include information about Finns who have moved abroad, and Finnish citizens who have returned to Finland after living outside of the country; the latter account for about a third of all immigration, although there is great variation from one year to another.\nOf Finland's 414 municipalities, 389 experienced net growth in the migration statistics from 2000 to 2008. There were 24 municipalities that experienced a net loss in immigration, and in one community the number of immigrants and emigrants were the same. For many communities, immigration has been the only way to maintain overall population growth, and in some communities, like the cities of Kotka, Kajaani, Mikkeli, and Kouvola, the population declined in spite of the immigration surplus.\nWhen the number of emigrants is subtracted from the number of immigrants, Finland had a net population gain of 73,147 people during the period studied. The immigration surplus has grown in recent years. In 2008 it was many times greater than it was in 2000. Advance figures by Statistics Finland indicate that last year, 27,147 people moved to Finland, and 13,411 emigrated from Finland. Among those leaving Finland"}
{"text":", 8,986 were Finnish citizens. The figure among the arrivals was 8,199.\nThe Helsinki region \u2014 Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa \u2014 accounted for a third of all immigration. The population of the three cities grew by 63,539 in 2000-2008. A third of the increase is attributable to growth in immigration. \"The main part of immigration flows targeted large cities, for understandable reasons. However, migration does not extend to the communities surrounding large cities, contrary to what is the case in migration inside the country\", Aho points out. In his view, population gains from immigration are spread evenly throughout the country, but eventually he expects immigrants to start moving to the same areas, which will be emphasised further in the internal migration flows of cities with a migration surplus.\nBringing foreigners together, but allowing them to live their own faith, is a big challenge for the Swiss Catholic Church, says its director of migration Marco Schmid.\nIntegration is not always easy, Schmid tells swissinfo, which is why the church has opted for creating more than 100 foreign language parishes within the country.\nThese missions hold their own masses and often have their own priests. The largest ones come from southern Europe, but eastern Europe and Asia are also represented.\nThere are around 1.7 million foreigners in Switzerland, and 50 per cent of them are Catholics, making them an important group for the Church, says Schmid.\nAs head of the Swiss Bishops Conference Migratio commission, 33-year-old Schmid is in charge of coordinating pastoral care for foreigners and dealing with social and ethical migration issues.

It could, and should, have been more competently managed, so preventing the rising tide of resentment among the public.'\nA report by the group shows the percentage of the world population who are international migrants rose from 2.5 per cent in 1960 to 3 per cent in 2005 \u2014 the most recent global figure. In Britain, it went from 4.5 per cent in 1961 to 9.3 per cent in 2005.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, it now stands at 11 per cent \u2014 one in nine of the population and the equivalent of 6.49million people born overseas living here.\nSir Andrew said the Government was to blame for outofcontrol migration for a number of reasons.\nThese included the policy, adopted by Labour in 1997, of trebling the number of work permits handed out every year to a record of 150,000 last year.\nOverall, net migration \u2014 or the number of people arriving compared to those leaving each year \u2014 has trebled from 107,000 to 317,000 in that time.\nHe highlighted the loss of embarkation controls, which count migrants in and out of the country, and Labour's decision in 1997 to axe the Primary Purpose Rule \u2014 a requirement for people seeking to enter by getting wed to show that the marriage was not a ruse to get into the country.\nImmigration by spouses has increased by more than 50 per cent since then.\nSir Andrew also said control of the asylum system was lost for several years,'so contributing considerably to"}

The LSE team said the figure lies somewhere between 524,000 and 947,000, with a \"midpoint\" figure of 725,000.\nThe LSE study was commissioned by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, who is advocating a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants, something both the Government and the Conservative Party leadership oppose.\nMany illegal immigrants work without paying taxes. Mr Johnson said that it is not realistic to try to find and expel all illegal immigrants, so it is better to try to bring them into the system and make them pay taxes.\n\"What I am trying to get people to recognise is that there are limits to what the policy to expulsions is able to achieve at the moment. Failing that, and it is failing, we need to think of a better alternative,\" Mr Johnson told the BBC.\n\"If people are going to be here and we've chronically failed to kick them out it's morally right that they should contribute in their taxes to the rest of society.\"\nHe said that illegal immigrants would have to meet \"tough\" criteria before being made legal. No one with a criminal record would be eligible, and applicants would have to show they were able to support themselves and their family, and to demonstrate a long-term commitment to British society.\nMr Johnson is the most senior politician to support an amnesty, which has also been backed by trade unions and Church of England bishops.\nBut Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, rejected the \"earned amnesty\" plan, saying it would only lead to more illegal immigration.\n\"What unfortunately would happen is that people traffickers and others would see that as a pull factor to get people to the United Kingdom illegally and we would end up with a bigger problem not just for our society, but for the people themselves involved,\" Mr Woolas said.\nThe tirade by Phil Woolas, the Immigration Minister, against the Office for National Statistics, must rank as one of the most gratuitous pieces of government bullying seen in many a year.\nMr Woolas said he was \"appalled\" by the decision of Karen Dunnell, head of the ONS, to release figures last week showing the proportion of foreign born people living in Britain. He said he found this \"politically embarrassing\". He called the decision to release the data as \"at best naive or, at worst, sinister\". He even admitted he sought to block the publication of the data on the grounds that they were \"neither new nor informative\". How does he explain, in that case, why every newspaper and media outlet found the figures both sufficiently new and informative to give them prominent coverage?\nThe statistics were included in the general run of population statistics that are routinely published by the ONS. Mr Woolas appears to believe that their publication resulted in the government being accused of \"whipping up anti-foreign sentiment when it is the independent ONS who are playing politics\".\nWhy is it \"playing politics\" to issue this figure? Does the Government want to conceal it? It is, after all, the direct result of the immigration policy the Labour party has pursued since taking office in 1997. Why are ministers no longer prepared to defend it? Mr Woolas was given his current portfolio not to manage immigration but to try to defuse its potential for causing political damage to the Labour party. He has been encouraged to show that the Government shares the concerns of voters over the number of foreign workers taking jobs in a recession and about the impact on infrastructure and social cohesion of a growing foreign population in the inner cities. Labour is rightly worried that extremist political groups like the BNP will step into this breach if it is not filled by mainstream parties.\nBut it is, frankly, extraordinary to find the Government trying"}
{"text":" to disavow the ramifications of its own actions. What did it think would happen as a result of an open-door immigration policy? To try now to browbeat the independent ONS into covering up the consequences of the Government's own policies is, in Mr Woolas himself might put it, \"at best na\u00efve or, at worst, sinister.\"\nWilliam Happer is hardly a climate change \"denier.\" A physics professor at Princeton, he is a former director of energy research for the U. S. Department of Energy, where he supervised work on climate change between 1990 and 1993. He is also one of the world's leading experts on \"the interactions of visible and infrared radiation with gases,\" and on carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect. Two weeks ago, he told the U. S. Congress, \"I believe the increase of CO2 (in the atmosphere) is not a cause for alarm.\"\nClaims that an increase of atmospheric CO2 will lead to catastrophic warming \"are wildly exaggerated,\" according to Prof. Happer. While a doubling (we have seen about a 35% rise since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution) might lead to a 0.6C rise in global temperature, he told Congress, \"additional increments of CO2 will cause relatively less direct warming because we already have so much CO2 \u2026 that it has blocked most of the infrared radiation that it can.\"\nProf. Happer added that while CO2 concentrations have risen steadily for more than 100 years, warming began before that \u2014 200 years ago \u2014 and even during the time when temperatures and carbon concentrations have risen together, the link has hardly been consistent. For instance, while CO2 was rising rapidly from 1950 to 1970, temperatures were going through an especially cold period.\nOver the past decade, while carbon dioxide concentrations have continued to grow, there has been \"a slight cooling,\" according to the Princeton physicist. Any warming in recent decades, then, \"seems to be due mostly to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon dioxide.\"\nWhy then do organizations such as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) continue to put faith in climate supercomputer models that show disastrous warming in the coming century? Because, as Prof. Happer explained, the IPCC believes in what is called a \"positive feedback loop.\"\nIn short, water vapour and clouds account for about 98% of the greenhouse effect versus less than 2% for CO2. The IPCC believes, though, that a doubling of CO2, while not significant on its own, will trigger a huge increase in the greenhouse impact of water vapour. But so far, in the real world, \"the feedback is close to zero and may even be negative.\" Prof. Happer testified.\nThe significance of Prof. Happer's statement is not that it proves global warming is false, but rather that it shows there is no consensus among respected scientists. The notion that the \"science is settled,\" as claimed by global warming advocates, is not true.\nAlso, two weeks ago, three of five independent scientists asked by Japan's Society of Energy and Resources to assess the current state of climate science concluded that global warming, to the extent it is still occurring, is a natural phenomenon, not manmade.\nIn his official contribution, Kanya Kusano, program director at the Earth Simulator at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, called the IPCC's warming theories \"an unprovable hypothesis\" and likened the current supercomputer models to ancient astrology.\nEven the Discovery Channel, never a fan of scientists who dissent from climate orthodoxy, reported last week on a University of Wisconsin study that shows global temperatures have at least flatlined during the past decade and that that trend could continue for another 30 years. The authors of that report \u2014 Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis \u2014 think rapid warming could resume after that. But for now, warming has ceased.\nAgainst this legitimate scientific doubt, recent statements by environmentalists and alarmist scientists sounds positively hysterical.\nRobert Kennedy, Jr. called coal companies \"criminal enterprises\" and demanded their CEOs be jailed \"for all eternity.\" Michael Tobis, a climate modeller at the University of Texas labelled as \"palpably evil\" anyone who questioned the wisdom of former U. S. vice-president Al Gore and suggested that doubting Mr. Gore was \"morally comparable to killing 1,000 people.\"\nU. S. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu claimed warming will lead to \"no more agriculture in California.\" Meanwhile Susan Solomon, of the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and lead scientist with the IPCC, said even if carbon emissions are stopped, temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000 and within 10 years \"the oceans will be toxic, and all life in them will die.\"\nIronic, isn't it, that those who doubt the warming theories are the ones called the \"deniers.\"\nHome affairs minister Guusje ter Horst has refused to name a"}

'If we carry on at that speed, we will never reach 25%,' the minister said.\nBut many MPs are unhappy with the minister's decision.

Following a 30-year trend of warming, global temperatures have flatlined since 2001 despite rising greenhouse gas concentrations, and a heat surplus that should have cranked up the planetary thermostat.\n\"It is possible that a fraction of the most recent rapid warming since the 1970s was due to a free variation in climate,\" Isaac Held of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Princeton, New Jersey wrote in an email to Discovery News. \"Suggesting that the warming might possibly slow down or even stagnate for a few years before rapid warming commences again.\"\n\"Free variation\" is the code phrase for \"can't be blamed on industrial economies of the West\".\nIn other words, just regular climatic change that the Earth undergoes.\nBut the funniest bit is the prediction for the future:\n[Kyle Swanson of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee] thinks the trend could continue for up to 30 years. But he warned that it's just a hiccup, and that humans' penchant for spewing greenhouse gases will certainly come back to haunt us.\n\"When the climate kicks back out of this state, we'll have explosive warming,\" Swanson said. \"Thirty years of greenhouse gas radiative forcing will still be there and then bang, the warming will return and be very aggressive.\"\nSo let me get this straight. Climate scientists are puzzled that their precious models have not successfully predicted the non-warming (ie, cooling) that has happened over the last few years, but they expect us to believe yet another prediction, this one being a full thirty years into the future?\nAnd this one has global warming just popping up out of the ether. How does that work again?\nBut when you think about it, this thirty-year prediction makes a lot of sense. For the next three decades, if these people are to be believed, global warming will be lurking on the sidelines, waiting to pounce on us. We won't actually see any warming, but apparently that's now to be expected.\nIf in thirty years, the temperature spikes, then these guys win!\nAnd if, as I suspect, nothing notable happens in thirty years? Well, then all that means is that all the money spent on semi-plausible carbon dioxide reduction programs, as well as all the money transfers to third world countries, did the trick, and that's why the temperature has remained stable.\nGee, good thing we listened to them, eh, instead of spending thirty years on something like increasing the food supply or wiping out childhood diseases.\n2 thoughts on \"Gates of Vienna News Feed 3\/9\/2009\"\nJun on March 10, 2009 at 2:49 pm said:\nThis is a great resource and a very valuable service!

In order to correct for this over-estimation future models will likely need to increase the effectiveness of aerosol forcing and feedback. If so this would imply that climate scientists have once again erred on the side of least drama with regard to the impacts on climate change as aerosol emissions are reduced:\nErik Hans Hoffmann, Andreas Tilgner, Roland Schr\u00f6dner, Peter Br\u00e4uer, Ralf Wolke and Hartmut Herrmann (November 2016), \"An advanced modeling study on the impacts and atmospheric implications of multiphase dimethyl sulfide chemistry\", PNAS, vol. 113 no. 42, 11776\u201311781, doi: 10.1073\/pnas.1606320113\nAbstract: \"Oceans dominate emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the major natural sulfur source. DMS is important for the formation of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO42\u2212) aerosols and secondary particulate matter over oceans and thus, significantly influence global climate. The mechanism of DMS oxidation has accordingly been investigated in several different model studies in the past. However, these studies had restricted oxidation mechanisms that mostly underrepresented important aqueous-phase chemical processes. These neglected but highly effective processes strongly impact direct product yields of DMS oxidation, thereby affecting the climatic influence of aerosols. To address these shortfalls, an extensive multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1.0, was developed and used in detailed model investigations of multiphase DMS chemistry in the marine boundary layer. The performed model studies confirmed the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the fate of DMS and its oxidation products. Aqueous-phase processes significantly reduce the yield of sulfur dioxide and increase that of methyl sulfonic acid (MSA), which is needed to close the gap between modeled and measured MSA concentrations. Finally, the simulations imply that multiphase DMS oxidation produces equal amounts of MSA and sulfate, a result that has significant implications for nss-SO42\u2212 aerosol formation, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, and cloud albedo over oceans. Our findings show the deficiencies of parameterizations currently used in higher-scale models, which only treat gas-phase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that treatment of DMS chemistry in both gas and aqueous phases is essential to improve the accuracy of model predictions.\"\n\"It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.\"\n\u2015 Leon C.

The climate system shows variability on many timescales, is subject to non-stationary forcing and it is most likely out of equilibrium with the changes in the radiative forcing. Slow and fast feedbacks complicate the interpretation of geological records as feedback strengths vary over time. In the geological past, the forcing timescales were different than at present, suggesting that the response may have behaved differently. Do these insights constrain the climate sensitivity relevant for the present day? In this paper, we review the progress made in theoretical understanding of climate sensitivity and on the estimation of climate sensitivity from proxy records. Particular focus lies on the background state dependence of feedback processes and on the impact of tipping points on the climate system. We suggest how to further use palaeo data to advance our understanding of the currently ongoing climate change.\"\nCaption for the attached image, Figure 2: \"Schematic of the phase diagram of a climate model with two stable coexisting climate states. The shape of the S curve follows closely that discussed in [62\u201364]; see also [65]. The climate sensitivity parameter S is defined on each of the stable branches as the local slope of the global mean surface temperature T versus the (logarithm of) atmospheric pCO2 (cf. Eq. 8 ). Type I state dependence: When starting at point A (e.g. the pre-industrial climate), the temperature increase after a doubling of pCO2 (point B) is smaller than when starting from a colder climate (point C) on the same branch. Type II state dependence: When the initial pCO2 is the same as in point A, but the climate is initially on the cold branch (point D), a doubling of pCO2 results in a smaller temperature increase (point E) than if starting from point A and ending in point B. S becomes undefined at the transition points (open squares) between the two branches. The conditional climate sensitivity is equal to S for small perturbations (going from points D to E), but largely increases if the perturbation in CO2 is large enough to move the system from point D beyond the bifurcation point (blue open square) and jumps to the warm branch. Note that S is generally defined as a local gradient, while the 2xCO2 definition in the ECS may involve a perturbation too large for the linear assumption along the branch to be applicable\"\nClimate Sensitivity with & without polar ice sheets.PNG (75.03 kB, 470x611 - viewed 1499 times.)\nThank you for laying this one on the table for us ASLR.

{"text":", the impacts of a sudden ocean acidification on the production rates of dimethylsulfide is not comparative, the increased warming due to this impact likely did not occur in previous interglacials, additionally, a rapid collapse of tropical peat and tropical rainforests, the sudden release of CO2 from rapidly warming soils and the rapid disassociation of permafrost is also not comparable to these much slower events.\nFinally, any attempt at modeling future climate responses, not taking into account the much slower warming rates of the world's oceans, must understand that the long-wave emissions from the worlds oceans during the early Pleistocene when CO2 was last at 400 ppmv and CH4 emissions rates were comparable to today's was much higher, that the oceans won't reach temperature equilibrium for another 2,000 years or so, and that the land and air temperatures will have to compensate by warming that much more to reach thermal equilibrium with the increased radiative forcing and ESS responses to this rapidly warmed climate.\nIndeed, only a WWII total societal mobilization response will produce the rapid reductions in emissions necessary to give us even a slim chance of maintaining our modern society.\nplease see: www.theclimatemobilization.org\nBy the way, I don't want to toot my own horn, but my second post on this forum was talking about this very same thing.\n(copied from the 2013 Short and medium term sea ice condition thread)\nQuote from: jai mitchell on June 18, 2013, 05:38:28 PM\nThis shows the intense permafrost melt associated with accelerated sea ice loss.\nhttp:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/geography\/class_homepages\/geog_4271_f10\/readings\/week_10_lawrence_et_al_2008.pdf\nThis shows how the loss of sea ice leads to a massive increase in the global temperature sensitivity to more carbon dioxide during the peak of prior interglacials.\nhttp:\/\/www.iac.ethz.ch\/people\/knuttir\/papers\/rohling12nat.pdf\n--sorry if this is very much off topic.\nThe link to Knuttir website was originally a link to the Paleosense ECS paper that I showed above, as shown by Chris Reyold's response:\nJai,\nIt's the loss of ice in the last ten days that has caused 2013 to have had such a large loss.

Here, through the analysis of various data sets and model simulations, we show that the Arctic polar vortex shifted persistently towards the Eurasian continent and away from North America in February over the past three decades. This shift is found to be closely related to the enhanced zonal wavenumber-1 waves in response to Arctic sea-ice loss, particularly over the Barents\u2013Kara seas (BKS). Increased snow cover over the Eurasian continent may also have contributed to the shift. Our analysis reveals that the vortex shift induces cooling over some parts of the Eurasian continent and North America which partly offsets the tropospheric climate warming there in the past three decades.

The extracts below only focus on the risks that the Southern Ocean may soon start venting more CO\u2082 than it is absorbing.\nJeff Tollefson (17 November 2016), \"How much longer can Antarctica's hostile ocean delay global warming?\", Nature, Volume: 539, Pages: 346\u2013348, doi:10.1038\/539346a\nhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/news\/how-much-longer-can-antarctica-s-hostile-ocean-delay-global-warming-1.20978\nThe waters of the Southern Ocean have absorbed much of the excess heat and carbon generated by humanity.\nAlthough controversial when she encountered it back in 1994, this powerful upwelling is now recognized as a hallmark of the Southern Ocean, a mysterious beast that swirls around Antarctica, driven by the world's strongest sustained winds. The Southern Ocean absorbs copious amounts of carbon dioxide and heat from the atmosphere, which has slowed the rate of global warming. And its powerful currents drive much of the global ocean circulation.\nAlready, initial data from an array of ocean floats suggest that upwelling waters could be limiting how much CO2 the Southern Ocean absorbs each year. This raises new questions about how effective these waters will be as a brake on global warming in decades to come.\n\"The Southern Ocean is doing us a big climate favour at the moment, but it's not necessarily the case that it will continue doing so in the future,\" says Michael Meredith \u2026\nIndirect evidence suggests that the Southern Ocean is a net carbon sink and has absorbed as much as 15% of the carbon emissions emitted by humanity since the industrial revolution. But at some times of year and in specific places in this region, carbon-rich surface waters release CO2 into the atmosphere.\nNow, researchers are getting some of their first glimpses in near-real time of what happens in the Southern Ocean, particularly in winter. \"Right off the bat, we are seeing CO2 fluxes into the atmosphere that are much greater than we had estimated before,\" Sarmiento says. \"It's just revolutionary.\"\nThe unpublished analysis is based on just 13 floats that have been in the water for at least a year, so the question now is whether the higher CO2 emissions during winter represent larger trends across the entire Southern Ocean.\n\"It's pretty tantalizing,\" says Alison Gray, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton who is leading the study. \"It would imply that potentially there is a much weaker carbon sink in the Southern Ocean than has been estimated.\"\nHints of something similar have been seen before. In 2007, a team led by Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, now director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, UK, published a study in Science indicating that the rate of carbon uptake by the Southern Ocean decreased between 1981 and 2004. The authors blamed the changes on the winds that encircle the Antarctic continent. The speed of those winds had increased during that time, probably as a result of the hole in the stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica and possibly because of global warming. Stronger winds are better able to pull up deep, ancient water, which releases CO2 when it reaches the surface. That would have caused a net weakening of the carbon sink.\nIf that trend were to continue, atmospheric CO2 levels would rise even faster in the future. However, a study in Science last year found that the carbon sink started to strengthen in the early 2000s (see 'The unreliable sink').\nLe Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 says it's unclear whether that rise in CO2"}

Since the late 1990s, the increase has accelerated, but the average of all climate models shows a decline. Meanwhile, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, an internally generated mode of climate variability, transitioned from positive to negative, with an average cooling of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, a slowdown of the global warming trend and a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low near Antarctica that has contributed to regional circulation changes in the Ross Sea region and expansion of sea ice. Here we show that the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in global coupled climate models is characterized by anomalies similar to the observed sea-level pressure and near-surface 850\u2009hPa wind changes near Antarctica since 2000 that are conducive to expanding Antarctic sea-ice extent, particularly in the Ross Sea region in all seasons, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low.

This study investigates the effect of sea ice reduction on Arctic cloud cover in historical simulations with the coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model MIROC5. Arctic sea ice has been substantially retreating since the 1980s, particularly in September, under simulated global warming conditions. The simulated sea ice reduction is consistent with satellite observations. On the other hand, Arctic cloud cover has been increasing in October, with about a 1-month lag behind the sea ice reduction. The delayed response leads to extensive sea ice reductions because the heat and moisture fluxes from the underlying open ocean into the atmosphere are enhanced. Sensitivity experiments with the atmospheric part of MIROC5 clearly show that sea ice reduction causes increases in cloud cover. Arctic cloud cover increases primarily in the lower troposphere, but it decreases in the near-surface layers just above the ocean; predominant temperature rises in these near-surface layers cause drying (i.e., decreases in relative humidity), despite increasing moisture flux. Cloud radiative forcing due to increases in cloud cover in autumn brings an increase in the surface downward longwave radiation (DLR) by approximately 40\u201360\u202f% compared to changes in clear-sky surface DLR in fall. These results suggest that an increase in Arctic cloud cover as a result of reduced sea ice coverage may bring further sea ice retreat and enhance the feedback processes of Arctic warming.\nThis document previously posted shows the impact of dimethyl sulifde on the atmosphere and global cooling impacts from current high-density forest regions.\nhttp:\/\/digital.csic.es\/bitstream\/10261\/117629\/1\/jgrd51980.pdf\nThis study shows the pollen records of previous interglacials showing what primoridal interglacials looked like from a forest biomass perspective.\nhttp:\/\/centaur.reading.ac.uk\/40025\/1\/cpd-11-1031-2015.pdf\nThis study shows that previous interglacial periods experience significantly increased temperature response to CO2 than the glacial periods. It is my assertion that the cause of this increased response is due to much higher temperature sensitivities to cloudcover fractions at lower latitudes and more rapid shifts of cloudcover regimes to the further northern latitudes during interglacials with increases in temperature, leading to rapid and significant albedo declines, increased solar absorption and increased temperatures.\nhttp:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/content\/2\/11\/e1501923.full\nnote that the expected ECS value for this study is closer to 5C.\nAlso supporting the potential for much higher interglacial ECS values is this study looking at a 2Mya global temperature reconstruction.\nhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v538\/n7624\/abs\/nature19798.html\nIn view of this information, with regard to future potential shifts in our climate. We are running, while blindfolded, carrying scissors.\nWe know that interglacial ECS is very likely at the high end (or higher) than the current IPCC range of 1.5C to 4.5C. We also know that primordial interglacial forest dimethyl sulfide emissions AT MIDLATITUDES was much higher than our currently (relatively) deforested northern hemisphere can produce.\nWe know that the largest uncertainty with regard to paleoclimate ECS is the aerosol component.\nIF my assertion is correct and this increase is due to increased cloud-cover fraction sensitivity during interglacials.\nTHEN"}

Good fucking morning ppl.\nWhere were you when Liberals rigged the primary against a real Leftist, Bernie Sanders, who was a sure bet against Trump and a climate hawk? He was our last great hope, and those with power in the climate movement mostly stayed quiet.\nWhere was the outrage the past 8 years over the fact that carbon emissions are STILL accelerating and we are STILL on the worse case path (BAU)? Where was the outrage at Obama for making USA the #1 oil producer, sent Hillary to export fracking around the world, and underhanded the entire Paris Climate Agreement?\nI see ppl on a crusade to defend renewables, as if they are sufficient or have been funded by anything close to the same scale which fossil fuels are. I see ppl already propagating the ridiculous Liberal talking points that Climate Change will be Trump's fault, as if the ship hasn't long past sailed at stopping CC?\nOther than Professor James Hansen and several others, most of those in the scientific establishment and Dem party cheered on as we congratulated ourselves on wasting more time in style.\nIn fact, Hillary was promising to do even less than Obama to fight CC, and ppl made fools of themselves defending her dirty history of FF peddling & donations. What about her support for TPP, which effectively prevents us from fighting Climate Change? At least maybe Trump stays true to his word and kills the TPP as promised, and thats a big Climate victory.\nHillary is a crook, as proven by Wikileaks info released on her. Did you read the speech where she told Wall St that Climate Activists pushing to stop burning of carbon should \"get a life\"??\nSure, Trump is an asshole and bigot (I'm dark-skinned btw), but I find it quite amusing that NOW so many ppl are outraged, at a president who hasn't even taken office yet? Sure, he's an asshole and climate denier, but the math shows not much will change in our carbon emissions for better of worse. We are currently STILL on the worst case path, and will remain so during Trump's term just like with Obama or would have been with Hillary.\nI will keep doing my part to fight for change, but I really do expect the worst. Both parties are climate deniers, including Liberals. Most of the Climate movement is in denial, most scientists are in denial. Worse, Liberals are like a quack doctor informing their patient his cancer is in remission, when its not. Other than some real Leftists, there is a complete inability to grasp just how far fucked we are and how urgently action is needed.\nWelp, its been nice guys.\nWhile I have repeated noted that I believe that scientists, policymakers and the general public have erred on the side of least drama with regard to the coming climate challenge that we are all facing; I have also come to appreciate that with a current global population of approximately 7.5 billion people, there are the same number of different points of view all having a unique interpretation of their perspective on \"the truth\". Some here have pointed-out that the size of the world population is the primary source of our problems and if only everyone else would just accept this \"truth\" then we would not have a population of approximately 7.5 billion and our problems would be solved. Others note that if everyone would just consume less then all of our problems would be solved. Others believe that if we just keep the global economy from running of the tracks long enough then technology will solve our problems. The permutations are endless, but at the end of the day each one of us needs to make-up our own minds and deal with the consequences of both our own and of our communal actions.\nIn short it is easy to find fault in others, but it is more effective to first take responsibility for our own actions; which then leads to an"}

But analysts and journalists often say (or imply) that there's less of an economic consensus, that economists are leery of the actions recommended by scientists because of their cost.\nIs it true?

There is broad consensus on some questions, a wider spread on others, but in every case the median opinion of climate economists supports more vigorous action against climate change, sooner. Like scientists, economists agree that climate change is a serious threat and that immediate action is needed to address it.\nhttp:\/\/www.vox.com\/2015\/12\/8\/9869918\/economists-climate-consensus\nThe linked article is entitled: \"Unprecedented Video Campaign: Scientists Talk About Why Climate Change Matters to Them Personally\".

Leftists have spoken for decades about the root of all our problems, that nothing will get done without flipping the table on the 1%. They were right.\nThis election saw the biggest grassroots uprising in American history raise more money from small donors for Bernie Sanders in the Dem party primary than any candidate ever has even for the general election. The movement focused on economic justice and climate change, and the majority were independents & millennials. Wikileaks confirmed Hillary & the Dem establishment's disdain for the movement and its agenda, employing tactics like McCarthyism, race-baiting, hiring of online trolls to falsely smear 24\/7, collusion among party elites, use of the state party branches to create a pyramid scheme circumventing max donation limits, collusion with media\/journalists on their smear campaigns and fake scandals. They worked tirelessly to take the movement down and destroy it as the threat to the monied interests that it is. Just like Obama did to Occupy Wall St too, destroyed by gov operatives. Ultimately, they still had to rig the polls to barely win with a candidate who was already polling as losing to Trump a year before the gen election, with historic unpopularity (especially among independents, who Trump polled well with do to his fake economic populism).\nAfter all the ridiculing and attacking of Bernie Sanders and our movement, the numbers showed a loss of ~11% of independents & Millennials, nearly half of those which voted for Trump so Hillary would lose. Those key votes in the swing states lose Hillary the election, by ppl who are economically ruined and see the so-called \"working ppl party\" working with the Repubs against them. Truth is, the Dem establishment prefers to lose with Hillary than win with Bernie. That is their job.\nOf course, Trump is highly unlikely to improve the lives of working ppl much, and our coalition can easily sweep in a real Leftist willing to take urgent action. The media's narratives are meaningless now, about half of voters dont trust a word of their propaganda. The same propaganda as all the climate optimism and \"progress\" published... nothing more than a marketing campaign to deceive & capture voters. Too many older adults accepted the Dem party's corruption, not realizing that their \"lesser evilism\" proved a slippery slope as both parties marched rightward. For example, Nixon was to the left of Obama economically.\nThe biggest problem now is who our 2020 candidate will be. Bernie is too old by then, and most Democrats are electoral poison now. The establishment Dem are irredeemable, bc they are not on our side. They dont intend to fight climate change. They are not the lesser evil.

These spikes could serve as analogues for the future of our warming planet.\nTheir new record spans the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO), the hothouse interval between about 17 and 15 million years ago. During the MCO, the average global temperature was up to 4\u00b0C warmer than today, and carbon dioxide concentrations hovered at about modern levels (400 parts per million).\nThe study also provides strong evidence that the lysocline, the depth in the ocean below which carbonates are much more quickly dissolved, was very dynamic during the MCO, repeatedly fluctuating by up to 600 meters.\nNotably, episodes of peak carbonate dissolution during the MCO coincided with warmer temperatures (as indicated by the oxygen isotope records), as well as a lightening of carbon isotopes. In contrast, during Pleistocene interglacial warming intervals, periods of higher temperatures (as indicated by the oxygen isotope records) corresponded to records of heavier carbon isotopes. This difference caused the team to conclude that the feedbacks between climate and the carbon cycle during the Miocene differed fundamentally from those at play during the more recent Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles.\nThe authors note that correlation between high temperature and light carbon isotopes, as seen during the MCO, was also observed during the Paleogene, an interval noted for its extremely rapid episodes of global warming and probable lack of ice caps. Therefore, they argue that climate and carbon cycle variability during the MCO, when global warming conditions probably limited ice cover at the poles, corresponded more closely to patterns observed during the Paleogene than those seen during more recent Pleistocene times, when Earth hosted two polar ice sheets.\"\nAbrupt, The Karlos abstract you linked talks about the lysocline shoaling during the MCO \" repeatedly fluctuated by up to 600 meters. \"\nI wanted to get an idea about how much carbon was required to get a 600 meter fluctuation in the lysocline.

It would only take 75 years to reach 300 meters of shoaling at the current rate of change.\nBecause the recovery time may be 40,000 years any extra carbon released as a result of melting of the ice caps would be additive to total anthropogenic carbon releases. This may indicate a carbon feedback that will equal the anthropogenic contribution. Something like 1200C plus 1200"}

It goes like this: \"The atmosphere isn't warming; and if it is, then it's due to natural variation; and even if it's not due to natural variation, then the amount of warming is insignificant; and if it becomes significant, then the benefits will outweigh the problems; and even if they don't, technology will come to the rescue; and even if it doesn't, we shouldn't wreck the economy to fix the problem when many parts of the science are uncertain.\"\nThe methane increases over the last years have finally been noticed by the Guardian as well:\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2016\/dec\/12\/rapid-rise-methane-emissions-10-years-surprises-scientists\nThe linked presentation entitled: \"HIATUS ON THE UPWARD STAIRCASE OF GLOBAL WARMING\", indicates that their method for filtering out natural internal variability of climate systems indicates that the global mean surface temperature is actually increasing at a higher rate than previously recognized:\nhttps:\/\/scripps.ucsd.edu\/news\/scripps-news-2016-agu-fall-meeting\nMeasuring Anthropogenic Global Warming in Real Time\nA43K-04 \u2022 Thursday, Dec. 15, 3:10 p.m. \u2022 Moscone West 3008\nDescription: \"A pair of researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and University of Tokyo have developed a means to track the increase in global mean surface temperature caused by human activities.\nThe method allows climate modelers to filter out the natural internal variability of climate systems to make society's impact clearer.

But recent shifts in the commercial and technological landscape signal a transformative moment for renewable energy, which now presents a credible challenge to fossil fuels in the competition for global investment.\nInvestments in renewable energy\nAs shown in Exhibit 1, global investment in renewable energy reached a record $285.9 billion in 2015. Between 2006 and 2015, investment in renewable energy totaled $2.2 trillion. Industry analysts forecast continued growth of renewable energy investment in coming years. The International Energy Agency projects cumulative renewable energy investment of $7.4 trillion by 2040.\nSolar and wind are the drivers of the renewable energy market, representing 56.0 and 38.0 percent respectively of global renewable investment in 2015. Solar power (photovoltaic and thermal) is the fastest growing renewable energy technology, with 2015 investment increasing by 12.0 percent over the previous year. Wind-related investment grew at a more modest rate, registering 4.0 percent year-on-year growth.\nThe growing attractiveness of solar and wind to global investors reflects the following factors:\nTechnological advances that boost the performance and reliability of solar and wind power.\nImprovements in energy storage systems that heighten the utility of intermittent renewables.\nRealisation of economies of scale that lower the costs of solar and wind energy.\nBioenergy (subsuming biomass-based liquid fuel and gas) lags far behind solar and wind power. From a peak $28.3 billion in 2007, bioenergy investments fell to $9.1 billion in 2015 against a combined $270.6 billion for solar and wind. The declining attractiveness of bioenergy illustrates:\nDiminished governmental subsidisation of biofuels in the United States and other countries\nPersistent concerns over the diversion of farm products (corn, sugar, etc.) from food to energy\nContinued barriers to commercialisation of next-generation bioenergy technologies such as algae and cellulosic ethanol\nRenewable energy capacity\nThese investments are yielding large increases in renewable energy capacity worldwide. Installed renewable capacity approached 2,000,000 MW in 2015, nearly double the level of 2006 (see Exhibit 2).\nHydropower represents the largest share (61.3 percent) of renewable energy capacity, well surpassing the portions of wind (21.9 percent), solar (11.5 percent), and bioenergy (5.3 percent). But hydro is also the slowest growing of the renewable energy categories, posting a capacity increase of just 35.5 percent between 2006 and 2015.\nHydropower holds substantial untapped potential. Advances in turbine design and lightweight composite materials enable the deployment of small, high-efficiency hydroelectric systems. However, a range of factors inhibit realisation of hydro's potential:\nLengthy and expensive permitting of hydroelectric projects, which must navigate a maze of environmental regulations (e.g. the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)\nLong distances between upstream hydro sources and major population centers that raise the costs of electricity transmission (e.g. Turkey)\nThe location of much of the world's non-utilised hydro resources in politically unstable countries (e.g., DR Congo)\nInstalled wind power grew by nearly 500 percent between 2006 and 2015. This development reflects steady gains in wind energy technology, particularly advances in turbine and blade design that permit continued windmill operations even in conditions of low wind velocity. The combination of increased scale and improved technology has enabled the achievement of grid parity in Germany and the United States, where onshore wind power now costs less than"}
{"text":" electricity generated by coal and CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) stations. Offshore wind represents a small fraction (3 percent) of total wind capacity, illustrating high commercial, environmental, and regulatory barriers to the installation of offshore wind turbines.\nSolar constitutes the fastest growing renewable energy sector. Installed solar power grew by over 3000 percent between 2006 and 2015. The surge of solar power results from rapid improvements in solar photovoltaic technology, notably advances in crystalline-silicon PV that have produced a dramatic decline in the cost of solar electricity. According to Dubai-based IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency), the cost of solar PV electricity has fallen from $0.285\/kWh in 2010 to $0.126\/kWH in 2015. The pending commercialisation of next generation solar technologies (including the concentrated solar PV system being piloted at Masdar City near Abu Dhabi) promise further reductions in the cost of solar power and continued expansion of solar capacity.\nRole of developing\/emerging economies\nThe leading role of the United Arab Emirates in the development and commercialisation of advanced renewable energy technologies illustrates the rising visibility of emerging\/developing economies in global renewable energy.\nChina was the top renewable energy investor in 2015, generating $102.9 billion or 36.0 percent of worldwide investments. That year installed renewable capacity in China reached 520 MW, over double the level of second-ranking U.S. China also enjoys the highest rate of growth of renewable energy capacity (283.5 percent increase in 2006-15 versus 172.0 percent in Germany and 75.9 percent in the U.S.). Measured by technology category, China is the world leader in installed hydro, wind, and solar power and third in bioenergy (see Exhibit 3).\nOther emerging economies (Brazil, India, Thailand, Turkey, et al) rank among the global leaders in renewable energy. Even hydrocarbon-centric Russia ranks among the world's top ten holders of renewable energy capacity, albeit almost entirely hydropower. The broader group of emerging\/developing economies generated $156 billion in renewable energy investments in 2015, surpassing the advanced industrialised countries for the first time.\nThe ascent of emerging\/developing economies in the renewable energy sphere reflects the following:\nOpportunities for emerging\/developing countries to leapfrog the international technology curve, which permits the rapid adoption of renewable energy technologies that originated in developed market economies like Germany, Japan, and the United States.\nThe rising cost competitiveness of renewable energy, which facilitates the deployment of solar and wind power for distributed generation in emerging\/developing countries and mitigates the need for costly investments in electricity grid infrastructure.\nThe more forgiving regulatory structures of emerging\/developing countries, which enable the fast tracking of renewable energy projects to meet increasing demand for power.\nRenewable energy vs. fossil fuels\nThe worldwide growth of renewable energy has coincided with the precipitous decline in hydrocarbon prices. Between June 2014 and January 2016, the price of oil (Brent crude spot) fell by 75 percent while the price of natural gas (U.S. Henry Hub) dropped by 58 percent.\nIn previous years, reductions in hydrocarbon prices have deterred investments in renewable energy. For example, in the mid- and late-2000s falling prices of oil and natural gas in North America (the consequence of advances in hydraulic fracturing and other extraction techniques) hindered investments renewable energy technologies. At that time, the relatively high costs of renewable energy made it difficult for private investors to justify major commitments to renewables amid cheap hydrocarbon prices.\nBut subsequent shifts in the technological and commercial landscape have altered the calculus of investors:\nThe dramatic fall in the cost of solar and wind power has made it possible for renewables to compete with fossil fuels, even with declining oil and natural gas prices and the curtailing of governmental support of renewable energy in Europe and North America.\nCurrent technology allows the speedier construction of renewable energy plants than fossil fuel plants (3-6 months for solar and 9 months for wind compared with several years for coal and CCGT sites), accelerating time to market and easing project financing.\nMounting international pressure for greenhouse gas reductions (dramatised by the December 2015 United Nations' COP 21 Climate Change Conference in Paris) has diminished the attractiveness of fossil fuels to the international investor community.\n2015 marked an inflection point for renewable energy: For the first time, the share of renewables in new power generation power (53.6 percent) exceeded that of fossil fuel. During the same year, installed renewable energy capacity reached 16.2 percent of the global power capacity, over twice the level obtaining in 2006. This development is unambiguously good news for the renewable energy industry, auguring favourably for fulfillment of the COP 21 international agreement on greenhouse gas reductions.\nBut these figures underscore the fact that fossil fuels still represent over 80 percent of global power capacity (and nearly 90 percent of actual power generation, whose higher share reflects the intermittency problems that still plague solar and"}
{"text":" wind power). Notwithstanding the rapid growth of renewable energy, the world economy will remain heavily dependent on hydrocarbons for years to come.\nThis article was written by David Bartlett\nExecutive in Residence\nDirector of Global and Strategic Projects\nThe publication is not intended to provide specific business or investment advice.

This is now shown in a study by scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. The observed changes in storm activity are likely related to changes in other atmospheric dynamics like the jet stream \u2013 strong westerly winds circling the Northern hemisphere high up in the sky.\nUnprecedented number of briefings in run-up of climate summit\n11\/16\/2015 - In the run-up of the much anticipated UN climate summit in Paris, scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are involved in an unprecedented number of briefings and public events. In this crucial time, stakeholders and media increasingly ask for the perspective of science on the state of the Earth and perspectives for climate policy. Yet PIK scientists also try to directly inform interested citizens. It is impossible to provide a complete list of all such outreach efforts, but here are some noteworthy examples.\nThe warmer the higher: sea-level rise from Filchner-Ronne ice in Antarctica\n10\/05\/2015 - The more ice is melted of the Antarctic Filchner-Ronne shelf, the more ice flows into the ocean and the more the region contributes to global sea-level rise"}
{"text":". While this might seem obvious, it is no matter of course for the huge ice masses of Antarctica: parts of the ice continent are characterized by instabilities that, once triggered, can lead to persistent ice discharge into the ocean even without a further increase of warming - resulting in unstoppable long-term sea-level rise. In the Filchner-Ronne region however, ice-loss will likely not show such behavior, scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research now found. Published in Nature Climate Change, their study shows that in this area the ice flow into the ocean increases just constantly with the heat provided by the ocean over time.\nDebate in the run-up to Paris\n09\/10\/2015 - What\u00b4s in store at the next climate conference, COP21, later this year? This week, staff of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research gathered for an exchange of insights and perspectives. There were a number of contributions from post-docs and senior scientists on the latest research that stimulated a vibrant discussion.\nCO2 removal cannot save the oceans \u2013 if we pursue business as usual\n08\/03\/2015 - Greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities do not only cause rapid warming of the seas, but also ocean acidification at an unprecedented rate. Artificial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere has been proposed to reduce both risks to marine life. A new study based on computer calculations now shows that this strategy would not work if applied too late. CDR cannot compensate for soaring business-as-usual emissions throughout the century and beyond, even if the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration would be restored to pre-industrial levels at some point in the future. This is due to the tremendous inertia of the ocean system. Thus, CDR cannot substitute timely emissions reductions, yet may play a role as a supporting actor in the climate drama.\nSnowball Earth: algae triggered cooling millions of years ago\n08\/27\/2015 - The advance of certain algae was probably one key contribution to an almost complete glaciation of the Earth millions of years ago. The consequent rise in emissions of organic cloud-condensation nuclei led to increased cloudiness. Thereby, they likely contributed crucially to the cooling of the climate, because clouds reduce solar radiation on the Earth\u00b4s surface. This was discovered by a team of scientists in a new study to be published today in the renowned journal Nature Geoscience.\nOur Common Future Under Climate Change\n07\/10\/2015 - This week, thousands of climate and social scientists as well as policy experts have met for the \"Our Common Future under Climate Change\" conference at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, among them a large number of experts from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). It has been the biggest gathering of high-ranking scientists paving the way for COP21 in December, laying out the state of science for fact-based decision-making.\nPIK researcher appointed new member of the Junge Akademie\n06\/11\/2015 - \"Outstanding and dedicated\" - Ricarda Winkelmann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is a new member of the Young Academy (Junge Akademie) of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and the German National Academy of Sciences. The Junge Akademie is the most important interdisciplinary network for German-speaking young scientists. Members of the Junge Akademie are elected for the duration of five years. To be eligible for membership, candidates should have completed their PhD within three to seven years prior to their application. Moreover, they should have published one further outstanding piece of work.\nPIK scientist appointed professor\n06\/05\/2015 - The Technical University Munich (TUM) appointed Anja Rammig, who has been working at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for many years, for a professorship at its School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan. That makes Rammig part of the growing number of professorships held by PIK scientists or to where they move on, an indication of the great scientific recognition of the research conducted at the institute.\nGetting connected: PhD-Day at the Potsdam-Institute\n06\/03\/2015 - From social networks for scientists and copyright issues and to visualization tools in climate research or dealing with climate skepticism \u2013 topics like these were discussed recently by young scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research at their annual meeting. The PhD-Day offers the opportunity for doctoral candidates to get together, share experiences and for further education in different science related fields. The theme of this year's meeting was \"getting connected\".\nInternational praise for young PIK scientists\n05\/29\/2015 - They work on carbon taxes, the German Energiewende and \"flying rivers\" in the Amazonian basin \u2013 the research of several young scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has recently been awarded for its excellence.\nAtlantic"}
{"text":" Ocean overturning found to slow down already today\n03\/24\/2015 - The Atlantic overturning is one of Earth's most important heat transport systems, pumping warm water northwards and cold water southwards. Also known as the Gulf Stream system, it is responsible for the mild climate in northwestern Europe. Scientists now found evidence for a slowdown of the overturning \u2013 multiple lines of observation suggest that in recent decades, the current system has been weaker than ever before in the last century, or even in the last millennium. The gradual but accelerating melting of the Greenland ice-sheet, caused by man-made global warming, is a possible major contributor to the slowdown. Further weakening could impact marine ecosystems and sea level as well as weather systems in the US and Europe.\nEarth-Docs wanted: a new kind of research position\n03\/18\/2015 - The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is offering a new kind of research position for outstanding young scientists: they can become an Earth-Doc as part of an international research team working across research institutions and disciplines. The state-of-the-art programme has been launched by the Earth League, an international alliance of 17 leading scientists and institutions, co-founded by PIK. Applicants for the new position focusing on the role of social agents in Earth system dynamics should have a background in global sustainability and modelling.\nGlobal warming brings more snow to Antarctica\n03\/17\/2015 - Although it sounds paradoxical, rising temperatures might result in more snowfall in Antarctica. Each degree of regional warming could increase snowfall on the ice continent by about 5 percent, an international team of scientists led by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research now quantified. Published in the journal Nature Climate Change, their work builds on high-quality ice-core data and fundamental laws of physics captured in global and regional climate model simulations. The results provide a missing link for future projections of Antarctica's critical contribution to sea-level rise. However, the increase in snowfall will not save Antarctica from losing ice, since a lot of the added ice is transported out into the ocean by its own weight.\nFour of nine planetary boundaries now crossed\n01\/16\/2015 - Four of nine planetary boundaries have now been crossed as a result of human activity, says an international team of 18 researchers in the journal Science. The four are: climate change, loss of biosphere integrity, land-system change, altered biogeochemical cycles. The scientists say that two of these, climate change and biosphere integrity, are \"core boundaries\" \u2013 significantly altering either of these would \"drive the Earth System into a new state\". The team will present their findings in seven seminars at the World Economic Forum in Davos (21-25 January).\nHonours for young PIK scientists\n12\/31\/2014 - Jonathan Donges of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research received the Wladimir Peter K\u00f6ppen Prize for his achievements in modelling the climate system. The award of the Cluster of Excellence CliSAP (Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction) in Hamburg honours outstanding doctoral theses of young scientists under the age of thirty years. The jury described Donges dissertation, submitted to Berlin's Humboldt University, as an innovative and outstanding contribution to current climate research.\nForests around the world affected by climate change\n12\/19\/2014 - Around the globe, forests are found to be undergoing strong changes due to human influence already today. Degradation of woods due to man-made climate change cannot be ruled out for the future, a Special Feature to be published next week in the Journal of Ecology, led by a team of scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), now shows. To understand and improve the resilience of forests, a combination of approaches from small-scale field experiments to large-scale computer simulations can help, according to the studies. Taking a risk perspective, the scientists caution that global warming puts additional pressure on some of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth.\nIce scientist appointed professor in Potsdam\n12\/17\/2014 - At 29, Ricarda Winkelmann has already accomplished what others may only dream of: She joined a scientific expedition to Antarctica, and is now set to become a junior professor for Climate Systems Analysis at the University of Potsdam. \"Ms. Winkelmann is known for her excellent research in a highly relevant field,\" said Robert Seckler, Vice President for Research and Junior Academics of the university. \"This joint appointment with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is s an excellent way of promoting young academics.\" During a ceremony, the physicist received her official appointment letter from the Science Minister of the German State of Brandenburg, Sabine Kunst, and also took her oath of service.\nHow humans shape the world: conclusion of the Anthropocene Project\n12\/15\/2014 - The Anthropocene project at the \"Haus der Kulture"}
{"text":"n der Welt\" in Berlin came to a conclusion after two years with a comprehensive campus programme. \"Our notion of nature is out of date. Humanity forms nature\" \u2013 this was the core premise of the underlying Anthropocene thesis, that has been discussed in events, exhibitions and discussions between natural sciences, culture, politics and everyday life since 2013. Numerous eminent artists, architects and researchers of the humanities as well as the natural sciences contributed to the project and the final campus sessions. Wolfgang Lucht of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research was part of the project from the very beginning.\n\"Climate change: the necessary, the possible and the desirable\"\n12\/01\/2014 - In time with this year's UN climate conference in Lima, a group of leading scientists, including Earth League members\u2013 a global alliance of prominent climate scientists \u2013laid out in a joint paper the key elements of the 'the necessary, the possible and the desirable' in relation to climate change. Authors include Johan Rockstr\u00f6m of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Nick Stern of the London School of Economics, Peter Schlosser of Columbia University in New York City, and two scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research: Wolfgang Lucht, co-chair of research domain Earth System Analysis, and director Hans Joachim Schellnhuber.\nTrapped atmospheric waves triggered more weather extremes\n08\/12\/2014 - Weather extremes in the summer - such as the record heat wave in the United States that hit corn farmers and worsened wildfires in 2012 - have reached an exceptional number in the last ten years. Man-made global warming can explain a gradual increase in periods of severe heat, but the observed change in the magnitude and duration of some events is not so easily explained. It has been linked to a recently discovered mechanism: the trapping of giant waves in the atmosphere. A new data analysis now shows that such wave-trapping events are indeed on the rise.\nAntarctica could raise sea level faster than previously thought\n8\/14\/2014 - Ice discharge from Antarctica could contribute up to 37 centimeters to the global sea level rise within this century, a new study shows. For the first time, an international team of scientists provide a comprehensive estimate on the full range of Antarctica's potential contribution to global sea level rise based on physical computer simulations. Led by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the study combines a whole set of state-of-the-art climate models and observational data with various ice models. The results reproduce Antarctica's recent contribution to sea level rise as observed by satellites in the last two decades and show that the ice continent could become the largest contributor to sea level rise much sooner than previously thought.\nHotspots of climate change impacts in Africa: making sense of uncertainties\n05\/06\/2014 - Overlapping impacts of climate change such as drought or flooding, declining crop yields or ecosystem damages create hotspots of risk in specific parts of Africa. These are for the first time identified in a study now published by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. The uncertainties in assessing the impacts do not necessarily hamper but can inform development strategies, according to the scientists. Likelihood and potential severity of impacts can be weighed to decide on suitable adaptation measures.\nUncorking East Antarctica yields unstoppable sea-level rise\n05\/05\/2014 - The melting of a rather small ice volume on East Antarctica's shore could trigger a persistent ice discharge into the ocean, resulting in unstoppable sea-level rise for thousands of years to come. This is shown in a study now published in Nature Climate Change by scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The findings are based on computer simulations of the Antarctic ice flow using improved data of the ground profile underneath the ice sheet.\n\"Global problems require globally coordinated science\": First German Future Earth Summit\n01\/27\/2014 - The ten-year research programme \"Future Earth\", an initiative of leading international scientific organizations bringing together existing programmes on global environmental change, starts its first German summit in Berlin today. More than 230 experts from natural and social sciences as well as engineering, the humanities and law will discuss new, interdisciplinary approaches or research in three core areas: Dynamic Planet, Global Development, and the Transition towards Sustainability. They aim at providing knowledge needed to tackle the most urgent challenges of the 21st century related to global sustainability through open and collaborative processes in partnership with society and users of science.\nClimate change puts forty percent more people at risk of absolute water scarcity: study\n12\/16\/2013 - Water scarcity impacts people's lives in many countries already today. Future population growth will increase the demand for freshwater even further. Yet in addition to this, on the supply side, water resources will be affected by projected changes in rainfall and evaporation. Climate change due to unabated greenhouse-gas emissions within our century is likely to put 40 percent more people at risk of absolute water scarcity than would be without climate change"}
{"text":", a new study shows by using an unprecedented number of impact models. The analysis is to be published in a special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that assembles first results of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP), a unique community-driven effort to bring research on climate change impacts to a new level.\nNetworks in the climate system: novel approach by young scientist awarded\n12\/10\/2013 - For his pioneering research on complex networks in our climate system a young scientist of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) received a prestigious prize. He was awarded by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) at a meeting in San Francisco attended by more than 22,000 earth and space scientists this week. By applying mathematical analysis to, for instance, data from drills in the deep-sea, he detected how shifts in African climate some million years ago influenced the fate of modern man's ancestors.\nExpert assessment: Sea-level rise could exceed one meter in this century\n11\/22\/2013 - Sea-level rise in this century is likely to be 70-120 centimeters by 2100 if greenhouse-gas emissions are not mitigated, a broad assessment of the most active scientific publishers on that topic has revealed. The 90 experts participating in the survey anticipate a median sea-level rise of 200-300 centimeters by the year 2300 for a scenario with unmitigated emissions. In contrast, for a scenario with strong emissions reductions, experts expect a sea-level rise of 40-60 centimeters by 2100 and 60-100 centimeters by 2300. The survey was conducted by a team of scientists from the USA and Germany.\nHeadlines and more on the IPCC's new report\n10\/15\/2013 - \"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia\" \u2013 this is the first of 18 headline statements provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC with the recently published first part of its new Assessment Report (AR5). The media covered the reports's release widely, asking lead authors and eminent experts at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for their comments.\nMore than 500 million people might face increasing water scarcity\n10\/08\/2013 - Both freshwater availability for many millions of people and the stability of ecosystems such as the Siberian tundra or Indian grasslands are put at risk by climate change. Even if global warming is limited to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, 500 million people could be subject to increased water scarcity \u2013 while this number would grow by a further 50 percent if greenhouse-gas emissions are not cut soon. At 5 degrees global warming almost all ice-free land might be affected by ecosystem change. This is shown by complementary studies now published by scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).\n\u00ab Previous 30 items Next 13 items \u00bb 1 2 3 4 5 6"}

Duke is a private university, and its West Campus, although in the city, stands apart and within Duke Forest, a vast patch of woods created through a component of a century-old Olmsted Brothers master plan. The campus landscapes cultivated by Duke offer a stark experiential contrast to the eclectic environmental qualities of a rapidly suburbanizing region. Duke's campus is a big draw for wedding receptions, picnics, walking and biking, and the occasional respite from nearby urban life. Durhamites regularly use the campus as an extended city park system. I've visited Duke's landscapes many times with family and students in search of memorable settings in an educational environment.\nDuke Pond, one of the newest campus landscapes, has been an increasingly popular attraction. On a recent visit to Duke Pond with my daughter, she waded into shallow water to scoop up a tadpole and said, \"This place is kinda scruffy, but I like it!\" When I relayed this story to Warren T. Byrd Jr., FASLA, the renowned landscape architect who concluded his career at Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects with this project, he laughed. He was thrilled that younger generations felt comfortable engaging the landscape directly. Enabling the informal discovery of ecology was what he had in mind. On a campus populated with works by many leading landscape architects, most of them manicured and tightly controlled, the pond offers an example of a different aesthetic as well as the roles landscape can play in exciting the next generation about environmental stewardship.

{"text":" workflow on November 5, 2019| 2 Comments \u00bb\nBY BENJAMIN H. GEORGE, ASLA, AND PETER SUMMERLIN, ASLA\nSoftware and technology trends in landscape architecture.\nFROM THE NOVEMBER 2019 ISSUE OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE MAGAZINE.\nIn 1982 a new tool landed on the desks of engineers that would revolutionize the construction and design industries. That tool, eventually known as AutoCAD, ushered computer-aided design into the field with the goal of increased accuracy and efficiency. In the decades since, a variety of software programs have become embedded in nearly every step of the design process, from site inventory and analysis to final project deliverables and beyond. Software has evolved from tools to represent design to those actually affecting design ideas. It's more than just software, as emerging technology such as drones, virtual reality (VR), and 3-D printers have found their way into offices. Whereas it was once adequate to master only AutoCAD, Photoshop, and SketchUp, many firms are now expected to collaborate and communicate using technology beyond this \"big three.\"\nAs firms wrestle with their software decisions and changing collaboration needs, knowledge of technology trends across the industry can be a valuable tool. With this in mind, ASLA's Digital Technology Professional Practice Network (DTPPN) teamed with professors from Utah State University and Mississippi State University to document and assess current developments in the profession. The survey was sent to a third of ASLA's members and garnered 482 responses, 72 percent of whom were full members of ASLA, and 17 percent associate members. When compared to surveys from previous years, the findings paint a picture of a profession in the midst of a watershed moment in how technology is used.

Hammond, George E. Patton, and John O. Simonds presented \"A Declaration of Concern\" on behalf of landscape architecture, reproduced below. It was a statement on the growing crisis in the natural environment and the claim of landscape architects in averting the environment's total destruction. To the degree the declaration was dramatic and self-regarding, it was also true. It preceded much of the formal regulatory protection\u2014preventive, punitive, and remedial\u2014of resources that we know now. The declaration's alarm over pollution and ecological ruin speaks for itself, but it managed to be both critical and optimistic. Its hope lay in the ability of landscape architects to figure out across disciplines how to make nature and society work as a whole, healthy system.\nIn 2016, the Landscape Architecture Foundation marked the half century of \"A Declaration of Concern\" with \"The New Landscape Declaration,\" a gathering of landscape architects, scholars, and advocates at the University of Pennsylvania in June of that year. The foundation, which was also turning 50, asked a number of participants to write declarations of their own for the occasion as latter-day responses to the original. Five are linked to below. Landscape architects have by no means retired the threats of 50 years ago, and other threats have proliferated around them, but the moral vision of the profession conceived at the midcentury has enlarged accordingly.\n\"A Declaration of Concern\u2014June 1966\"\nWe urge a new, collaborative effort to improve the American environment and to train a new generation of Americans equipped by education, inspiring example, and improved organizations to help create that environment.\nA sense of crisis has brought us together.

Maryman recently completed a Landscape Architecture Foundation fellowship to explore the intersection of homelessness and public space; one result is his podcast HomeLandLab. Now he wanted to check on some encampments. He has a boyish look, a gingery beard, and a ready chuckle. He was dressed like many Seattle professionals, in a hooded puffer jacket and sneakers. He doesn't smoke, but before leaving the house he dropped an unopened pack of Marlboros into his bag. \"My public outreach tool,\" he grinned. Also for distribution: new socks, granola bars.\nSeattle is a powerhouse of contrasts. The city has added about 22,000 jobs a year recently, but only about 8,000 new residential units. The median house price doubled between 2012 and 2017. In Maryman's originally working class and still less-than-glamorous neighborhood, new town houses smaller than 1,500 square feet on postage-stamp lots are listing for around $700,000. Downtown and its margins are thick with new residential towers and construction cranes. But Seattle, with surrounding King County, has among the largest homeless populations, per capita, of any American metropolis. A one-night count in January 2019 found 11,199 people homeless. Nearly half were \"unsheltered\"\u2014sleeping not in emergency shelters or transitional housing but in parks, beneath bridges, in doorways, parking lots, alleys, or the verges of expressway on-ramps. They live in cars or RVs, vacant buildings, tents, or literally without shelter. Drifts of makeshift dwellings shape themselves to interstitial spaces, seemingly everywhere. From a distance, they are unified by their blue tarps. Blue tarps, as in refugee camps.\nMaryman pulled on an orange safety vest, stepped off the paved trail, and headed down a steep informal path. The vest, suggesting he was a park worker, counterintuitively made his approach \"less threatening,\" he said. Homeless people, \"often themselves victims\" of theft, manipulative drug dealers, or sexual attack, can be wary of strangers. Nearing a small cluster of tents, he stood well back and called cheerfully, \"Knock, knock! Anybody home?\" Home.

Now it has rows of budding trees that divide up the three-acre expanse, and there's a large grassy area and little enclaves with stumps and log seating away from the hustle and bustle. By offering a variety of settings, the schoolyard gives students the ability to choose where and how they spend their time at recess. Claire Latan\u00e9, ASLA, the Los Angeles-based ecological designer who led the renovation of the grounds, says it also should improve their mental health.\nLatan\u00e9 believes supporting the mental health of students is key to their happiness and well-being. Her conviction is based on decades of academic research by others, her own experience analyzing and designing schoolyards, and her gut feeling about the topic, as both a designer and a mother. Despite all we know about the impact our surroundings have on us\u2014and the progress being made to introduce therapeutic environments to health care facilities\u2014schools aren't being designed with mental health as a consideration, let alone a priority. They are defensive (and ever more so, even provisionally, given gun violence in schools). Many schools have as much charm as storage facilities these days, and the worst are, in their environmental design, practically penal.\nThrough advocacy, writing, and teaching, Latan\u00e9 is trying to change that reality. She has encouraged the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), (more\u2026)\nPosted in ECOLOGY, FEATURES, IN THE ISSUE, PEOPLE, PLANNING, PRACTICE, RESEARCH, TECH, tagged agent-based model, AI, algorithms, Amazon, Anya Domlesky, Aquaveo, Architectural Intelligence: How Designers and Architects Created the Digital Landscape, Artificial intelligence, auditory data, bias, black box, Bradley Cantrell, Bruno Latour, coastal residence, conservation, Conservation Metrics, Darkflow, David J.

{"text":", ASLA, an associate at SWA in Sausalito, California, rattles off how she and the firm's innovation lab team train a computer to recognize the flora and fauna in an urban plaza.\nThe effort is part of the firm's mission to apply emergent technologies to landscape architecture. In pursuing the applied use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the research and innovation lab XL: Experiments in Landscape and Urbanism follows a small but growing number of researchers and practitioners interested in the ways the enigmatic yet ubiquitous culture of algorithms might be deployed in the field.\nExamples of AI and machine learning are all around us, from the voice recognition software in your iPhone to the predictive software that drives recommendations for Netflix binges. While the financial and health care industries have quickly adopted AI, and use in construction and agriculture is steadily growing, conversations within landscape architecture as to how such tools translate to the design, management, and conservation of landscapes are still on the periphery for the field. This marginality may be because despite their everyday use, mainstream understandings of AI are clouded by clich\u00e9s\u2014think self-actualized computers or anthropomorphic robots. In a recent essay on Medium, Molly Wright Steenson, the author of Architectural Intelligence: How Designers and Architects Created the Digital Landscape (The MIT Press, 2017), argued that we need new clich\u00e9s. \"Our pop culture visions of AI are not helping us.

With surgical precision, Adichie reveals the lasting consequences of perpetuating Africa and Africans as only victims suffering from famine and war, or only the exotic backdrop for experiencing \"charismatic nature.\" But in the end, her most devastating criticism of the single story is embodied in her quote of the Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti, \"If you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with'secondly.'\" Illustrating her point, Adichie asks facetiously what we would think if the story began with a \"failed\" African state instead of with European colonialism.\nThe issue of starting with \"secondly\" is present in cultural landscape study of the continent of Africa. The spirit of Adichie's and Barghouti's arguments resonates in the pages of Cultural Landscape Heritage in Sub-Saharan Africa, edited by John Beardsley. The volume collects essays delivered at a symposium held at Dumbarton Oaks in 2013 and reflects an important first step in laying the foundation for future exploration. Through a wide array of disciplinary lenses, geographic locations, and time periods, Beardsley's work eschews deriving a single conclusion about what"}
{"text":" is \"African\" and instead reveals the wealth of issues and opportunities with engaging the many cultures of a continent. The avoidance of narrowing and bridging the divergent voices contained within the book is challenging and perhaps belies the fact that this is one of the first mainstream publications on this topic. Given the lack of similar texts, there could be a tendency to attempt to be singular and definitive. However, borrowing from one of the book's many themes, the result is a contribution to the \"continuity\" of a conversation about the lives and practices that have shaped meaningful place in Africa, a continent still invisible to the profession of landscape architecture.

Under the proposed new security system, customers will have to scan their ID before they can enter the premises according to a recent article in CBC.\nAlcanna, Canada's biggest private retailer of alcohol is launching a pilot project in partnership with Edmonton police. The project will be tested at Ace Liquor, located at 11708 34th St. in northeast Edmonton. Alcanna stated the intent of the project is to deal with \"the epidemic of liquor store robberies that has plagued the city,\" a problem that has escalated rapidly in the past year and a half.\n\"In 2019, EPS officers responded to almost 9,600 calls of theft of liquor \u2014 about 26 calls per day across the city,\" Const. Robin Wilson said in the release. An increase of 200 percent since 2018.\n\"It's not just people taking advantage of something that is easy, it's somebody preying on people as well,\" he said.\nDale McFee, Chief of Edmonton police told CBC News that investigators often find that some of the thefts are gang-related and that it presents a huge problem for the city.\n\"Ultimately, the way we are right now and the amount of officer time and different things that are going on in this space, it's not working. So it's time to try a few things.\"\nThe new scan system requires patrons to scan their identification before the door will unlock and allow entry into the store. This practice has already been used by bars and nightclubs in Edmonton for years.\nThe Alcanna pilot project has been positively received by many including Const. Wilson who commended the company for \"taking proactive steps to increase the safety of both their employees and the general public,\"\nJoe Cook is the vice-president of Alcanna which in addition to Ace Liquor, also owns the Liquor Depot, Wine and Beyond and Nova Cannabis brands. \"Just as was done with pre-pay and pay at the pump for gas stations, we are hoping Patronscan creates a safer shopping experience,\" said Cook in a news release. \"This is not shoplifting,\" he said. \"It is robbery with real or threatened violence.\"\nEdmontonians won't have to worry about their privacy rights as the customer ID information will not be kept in the devices but stored in Patronscan's data centre with restricted access, according to a press release from Alcanna.\nWant to help us grow?

Some people are referring to this trend as a tax revolt according to CTV News.\n\"If Alberta's property tax system is not amended to prevent oil and gas companies from refusing to pay property taxes, many rural municipalities will struggle to remain viable,\" association president Al Kemmere said in a release.\nThe municipalities want the province to change the rules in order to force companies accountable for the taxes they owe Kemmere explained. As it currently stands property taxes are controlled by the province and not the local communities.\n\"A lot of the oil and gas is doing their fair part as citizens, but we need legislation to force others to pay much like everybody else has to pay,\" said Kemmere.\nRural Municipalities Alberta"}

According to the survey, oil and gas companies owe a total of $173 million.\nReeve Paul McLauchlin estimates that his municipality of Ponoka County, south of Edmonton, is owed about $2.6 million out of a total of $27 million. The oilpatch consultant said, \"It creates operational constraints, our ability to provide community services. We have nonprofits asking for assistance. We say 'no' more and more.\"\nMany people in the industry believe that it's the way that taxes are assessed that is driving companies out of business. The provincial government is in charge of assessing properties however they evaluate them based on replacement cost and not market value.\n\"We defend the need for the province to take a look at how assessment works and have it reflective of the market,\" said Ben Brunnen, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.\n\"A lot of these unpaid taxes are coming in jurisdictions where you've got assets that are older and not as productive or economic. The choice for these types of assets is to shut (them) in or find a way to reduce costs.\" he said.\nBrunnen suggested that some municipalities are going to have to accept less revenue from oil and gas companies as a result of such shut-in walls which are often abandoned or never reclaimed after bankruptcy.\nLast year it was ruled that municipalities are unsecured creditors by the Alberta Court of Appeal. This ruling effectively puts them at the back of the line when it comes to tax collection following a bankruptcy.\nThe Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project works to comprehend the impact of old energy infrastructure on the province. Regan Boychuck, a researcher working for the project claimed, \"Oilpatch property tax are now voluntary.\"\nAbout 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from distressed companies that are feeling the effects of an industry hit by lower resource prices according to McLauchlin. The rest belongs to companies that continue to operate without paying.\n\"My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,\" McLauchlin said. \"They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs.\"\nOne could argue that in a sense the process has already begun. Alberta's United Conservative government brought in legislation that allowed municipalities to cut taxes on specific well by up to about one-third last year.\nInitially, the cuts would be reimbursed by the province but the municipalities said that the program has been abandoned and they are left to deal with the loss.\nBoychuck said despite the decline of oil and gas reserves the mill rates on wells and other facilities have remained unchanged for years.\n\"What industry is really saying is that they've depleted their wells so far they can't cover operating costs. The wells are done and whatever wealth remains needs to be directed to clean up rather than looted any further before bankruptcy.\"\nThe Orphan Well Association is an industry-funded group that was created to clean up abandoned wells. They currently have 3,400 abandoned wells under their care and that number is up by 300 since the beginning of last year.\nTAGS#Alberta#canada#gas prices#oil\nWexit would devastate Saskatchewan: Ralph Goodale\nJason Unrau\nFormer Saskatchewan MP and Liberal cabinet minister Ralph Goodale said the nascent Wexit separation movement threatens Conservative parties in the province and \"would be devastating\" economically.\n\"Because where will those votes come from in the first place, those votes that would support the Wexit movement if it became a party? Those votes would come primarily from the Conservatives and the Sask Party,\" Goodale told CBC Saskatchewan.\n\"So it is in the interests of the Conservatives and the Sask Party to ensure that the Wexit movement does not become a political party that would take votes from them.\"\nGoodale had served as Regina-Wascana's MP since 1993 but lost his seat to Conservative Michael Kram in last year's 43rd general election, leaving the province without a single seat in the House of Commons.\nThe former Finance minister (PM Paul Martin) and Public Safety Minister in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's previous majority government also said separation would have immediate economic consequences for Saskatchewan.\n\"When you actually go to the dollars and cents and the nuts and bolts of it all, it would be devastating,\" he said.\n\"We would lose right off the top, for example, $1.7 billion in transfer payments that come into Saskatchewan because of the government of Canada. We would lose things like the RCMP Training Depot at Regina. That would be gone. That's $40 million every year into the economy.\"\nGoodale went on to suggest that the Wexit debate itself was \"counterproductive.\"\n\"It leads people to have great and furious arguments.

The ruling is another setback for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a controversial 600-mile, $7.5 billion project being led by Dominion Energy.\nIssued Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the decision faulted Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board for an action that it said was \"arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\"\nThe folks in Union Hill were featured in a recent Friday fracking video, and we should all applaud this decision.

But the rules governing quasi-judicial hearings, which much like a trial include sworn testimony and evidence, are strict and clearly laid out in state statute.\nAnd in deciding on special permits, the governing board, in this case the Robeson County Commission, can't have a \"fixed opinion\" on the issue before hearing all of the evidence. To do otherwise would be akin to a judge or jury issuing a verdict before a trial even began. But as court documents show, the commissioners strongly supported the ACP long before they were confronted with the decision to issue a special permit for the station and tower.\nI've had to \"preside\" over a few of these quasi-judicial hearings myself, and you have to watch every step you take. In this particular case, what they said in the weeks or months before the hearing will (likely) not be nearly as important as the procedural process itself. If they crossed their t's and dotted their i's, and if the applicant's testimony was not obviously incorrect or deceptive, the Commissioners will probably skate on this lawsuit.

Massachusetts State Police urged all residents with homes serviced by Columbia Gas in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover to evacuate, snarling traffic and causing widespread confusion as residents and local officials struggled to understand what was happening.\nThe Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency blamed the fires on gas lines that had become over-pressurized but said investigators were still examining what happened. Columbia had announced earlier Thursday that it would be upgrading gas lines in neighborhoods across the state, including the area where the explosions happened. It was not clear whether work was happening there Thursday, and a spokeswoman did not return calls.\nOne of the (many) drawbacks to using natural gas is that \"all\" lines require pressure, and that pressure is relative to the size and distance the gas must travel. The big pipelines require an extreme amount of pressure, which is one of the things that make them so dangerous. But even small lines that serve individual homes or businesses require pressure, and just a modest increase can result in fugitive emissions (leaks).

Judge John Grinsteiner's decision Monday ends the yearlong dispute in state district court, but doesn't resolve a disagreement over whether TigerSwan was conducting work that required a license in North Dakota.\nNorth Dakota's Private Investigative and Security Board plans to appeal the case's dismissal to the state Supreme Court, attorney Monte Rogneby said. Should that fail, the board can still pursue tens of thousands of dollars in fines against TigerSwan through an administrative process.\nBefore we proceed, just a side-note: This North Dakota government regulatory board is exactly the kind of organization groups like Civitas want to abolish, because they exert control over private businesses by requiring licenses and permits and such.

Mountain Valley Pipeline wants to install a pipeline that would begin in Pittsylvania County, Va., and extend about 70 miles south to Rockingham and Alamance counties and end in Graham, just south of Interstate 40-85.

{"text":"Tag Archives: greenhouse gases\nTurning Oceans into Muck\nOxygen is critical to the health of the planet. It affects the cycles of carbon, nitrogen and other key elements, and is a fundamental requirement for marine life from the seashore to the greatest depths of the ocean. Nevertheless, deoxygenation is worsening in the coastal and open ocean. This is mainly the result of human activities that are increasing global temperatures (CO2-induced warming) and increasing loads of nutrients from agriculture, sewage, and industrial waste, including pollution from power generation from fossil fuels and biomass.\nFacts: During the past 50 years the area of low oxygen water in the open ocean has increased by 4.5 million km2. The world' oceans are now losing approximately 1 gigaton of oxygen each year.\nThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment released by the UN in 2005 reported that nitrogen containing compounds (e.g. sewage, fertilizers) release into the oceans grew 80 percent from 1860 to 1990.\nIncreasing temperatures will reduce the capacity of the ocean to hold oxygen in the future;\nOxygen deficiency is predicted to worsen in estuaries, coastal areas and oxygen minimum zones in the open ocean;\nThe ocean's capacity to produce oxygen will be reduced in the future.\nHabitat loss is expected to worsen, leading to vertical and horizontal migration of species;\nOxygen deficiency will alter biogeochemical cycles and food webs;\nLower oxygen concentrations are projected to result in a decrease in reproductive capacity and biodiversity loss;\nThere are important local decreases of commercially important species and aquaculture production;\nHarmful Algal Blooms will be exacerbated from nutrients released in bottom waters due to hypoxia (e.g. in the Baltic Sea);\nReduced ocean oxygen concentrations will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby initiating feedbacks on climate change;\nExcerpts from UNESCO, Jan. 2018\nView Extensive Abstract\nBackground paper (pdf)\nGlobal Ocean Oxygen Network: Through the participation of high level scientists from across the world, the IOC expert group, the Global Ocean Oxygen Network GO2NE, established in 2016, is committed to providing a global and multidisciplinary view of deoxygenation, with a focus on understanding its multiple aspects and impacts.\nThis entry was posted in agriculture, biodiversity, climate change, Environment, hazardous waste, marine pollution and tagged algal blooms, biodiversity loss oceans, deep ocean pollution, deoxygenation, greenhouse gases, greenhouse gases and oceans, hypoxia, ocean acidification, ocean pollution, oxygen deficiency oceans, oxygen depletion oceans, protection of oceans on January 8, 2018 by Stoa.\nCut or Pay up: Net Negative Carbon Emissions\nSweden's parliament passed a law in June which obliges the country to have \"no net emissions\" of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2045. The clue is in the wording. This does not mean that three decades from now Swedes must emit no planet-heating substances; even if all their electricity came from renewables and they only drove Teslas, they would presumably still want to fly in aeroplanes, or use cement and fertiliser, the making of which releases plenty of carbon dioxide. Indeed, the law only requires gross emissions to drop by 85% compared with 1990 levels. But it demands that remaining carbon sources are offset with new carbon sinks. In other words greenhouse gases will need to be extracted from the air\u2026\n[I]f the global temperature is to have a good chance of not rising more than 2\u00baC above its pre-industrial level, as stipulated in the Paris climate agreement of 2015, worldwide emissions must similarly hit \"net zero\" no later than 2090. After that, emissions must go \"net negative\", with more carbon removed from the stock than is emitted\u2026\nTo keep the temperature below a certain level means keeping within a certain \"carbon budget\"\u2014allowing only so much to accumulate, and no more. Once you have spent that budget, you have to balance all new emissions with removals. If you overspend it\u2026you have a brief opportunity to put things right by taking out more than you are putting in\u2026\nClimate scientists like Mr Henderson have been discussing negative-emissions technologies (NETs) with economists and policy wonks since the 1990s. [But] NETs were conspicuous by their absence from the agenda of the annual UN climate jamboree which ended in Bonn on November 17th 2017.\nReforesting logged areas or \"afforesting\" previously treeless ones presents no great technical challenges. More controversially, they also tend to invoke \"bioenergy with carbon capture and storage\" (BECCS). In BECCS, power stations fuelled by crops that can be burned to make energy have their carbon-dioxide emissions injected into deep geological strata, rather than released into the atmosphere\u2026.\nThe Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies that exist today"}
{"text":", under development by companies such as Global Thermostat in America, Carbon Engineering in Canada or Climeworks of Switzerland, remain pricey. In 2011 a review by the American Physical Society to which Ms Wilcox contributed put extraction costs above $600 per tonne, compared with an average estimate of $60-250 for BECCS\u2026\nMuch of the gas captured by Climeworks and other pure NETs firms (as opposed to fossil-fuel CCS) is sold to makers of fizzy drinks or greenhouses to help plants grow. It is hard to imagine that market growing far beyond today's total of 10m tonnes. And in neither case is the gas stored indefinitely. It is either burped out by consumers of carbonated drinks or otherwise exuded by eaters of greenhouse-grown produce\u2026..\nOne way to create a market for NETs would be for governments to put a price on carbon. Where they have done so, the technologies have been adopted. Take Norway, which in 1991 told oil firms drilling in the North Sea to capture carbon dioxide from their operations or pay up. This cost is now around $50 per tonne emitted; in one field, called Sleipner, the firms have found ways to pump it back underground for less than that. A broader carbon price\u2014either a tax or tradable emissions permits\u2014would promote negative emissions elsewhere, too\u2026\nAnother concern is the impact on politicians and the dangers of moral hazard. NETs allow politicians to go easy on emission cuts now in the hope that a quick fix will appear in the future.\nExcerpt from Sucking up Carbon, Combating Climate Change, Economist, Nov. 18, 2017\nThis entry was posted in agriculture, Alternative Energy, climate change, Energy, Environment, Markets and tagged bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), carbon budget, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), carbon footprint, greenhouse emissions, greenhouse gases, negative-emissions technologies (NETs), net negative greenhouse emissions, net zero greenhouse emissions, price of carbon on November 30, 2017 by Stoa.\nCooling Down: The Montreal Protocol at 2016\nIn 1974 scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals used in refrigeration and as propellants in products such as hairsprays, release chlorine into the stratosphere as they decompose. This depletes the ozone that protects Earth from ultraviolet radiation. CFCs are also powerful greenhouse gases, which absorb solar radiation reflected back from the planet's surface and so trap heat in the atmosphere.\nInitially, the consequences for the ozone layer caused most concern. In 1985 a gaping hole in it was found above Antarctica. Two years later, leaders from around the world acted decisively. They signed a deal, the Montreal protocol, to phase out CFCs. Now ratified by 197 countries, it has prevented the equivalent of more than 135 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide emissions, and averted complete collapse of the ozone layer by the middle of the century. Instead, by that point the ozone hole may even have closed up\u2026.\nIn order to manage without CFCs, firms replaced them in applications such as refrigeration, air-conditioning and insulation with man-made hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These substances do not deplete ozone and last in the atmosphere for just a short time. However, they still contribute hugely to global warming. The average atmospheric lifetime for most commercially used HFCs is 15 years or less; carbon dioxide can stay in the atmosphere for more than 500 years. But, like CFCs, HFCs cause a greenhouse effect between hundreds and thousands of times as powerful as carbon dioxide while they linger. Total emissions are still relatively low, but are rising by 7-15% a year. Controlling HFC emissions has been under discussion for the past decade; America and China, the world's two biggest polluters, made a deal on the issue in 2013, which paved the way for co-operation on limiting carbon emissions ahead of UN-sponsored climate talks in Paris last year. There leaders agreed to keep warming \"well below\" levels expected to be catastrophic.\nAverage global temperatures are already 1\u00b0C higher than in pre-industrial times\u2026.America wants action on HFCs speedy enough that emissions will peak in 2021 and then start to fall; after recent talks in Hangzhou between Mr Obama and Mr Xi China may be ready to commit to reaching that point by 2023. Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia lean towards 2025, and India has lobbied for a later date, closer to 2030.\nSome sectors firms are already preparing to move away from HFCs: in 2015 the Consumer Goods Forum, an international industry group whose members include Walmart and Tesco, began enacting a plan to phase out the substances.\nA big question is what to use instead\u2026.Some HFCs commonly used in refrigeration could be replaced by others that would have an impact more than 1,000 times smaller.

A new report [authored by environmental groups] reveals the how recent involvement of the US in the lobby offensive to keep the EU market open for bitumen exports has tipped the scales in favour of oilsands proponents\u2026.\nThe report shows the EU Fuel Quality Directive, a piece of legislation designed to reduce global warming greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU's transportation sector, is unlikely to acknowledge fuels from different sources of oil \u2013 conventional oil, oilsands, oil shale \u2013 have different carbon footprints. All oil is the same \u2013 no matter how great the disparity in emissions Instead all oils will more than likely be treated as having the same GHG emissions intensity 'value' in the Directive. This is exactly what Canada, the oil industry and now the US have been pushing for\u2026\nThe EU has not fallen for the federal government's argument that bitumen produces only marginally more GHG emissions than conventional oil in extraction, processing, and use. A European Commission study found bitumen's carbon footprint is between 12% \u2013 40% higher than conventional oil as so much of the bitumen produced from the tar sands is burnt to fuel the energy-intensive extraction process. The report reveals trade, not science, is the cause of the EU backing off from implementing the Fuel Quality Directive as it was originally meant to be implemented.\nThe US in some ways has been more open [than Canada] about its lobbying against the Fuel Quality Directive. US Trade Representative Michael Froman confirmed he \"raised these issues [of the FQD implementation] with senior Commission officials on several occasions, including in the context of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnerships (TTIP).\" The TTIP is the highly controversial trade agreement between the US and the EU currently under negotiation. European Commission documents obtained by Friends of the Earth Europe reveal the US trade missions has \"substantive concerns\" with the Fuel Quality Directive singling out fuels produced from bitumen as having a higher carbon footprint than conventional oil. Like Canada and the oil industry, the US wants all oil \u2013 regardless of GHG emissions \u2013 to be treated the same as conventional oil in the Directive\u2026Recently eleven members of US Congress sent a letter to the US trade mission expressing their concerns \"that official US trade negotiations could undercut the EU's commendable efforts to reduce carbon pollution.\"\nExcerpts, Derek LeahyIgnore tar sands emissions!

The proposal provides guidelines for states to develop plans to meet state-specific goals to reduce carbon pollution and gives them the flexibility to design a program that makes the most sense for their unique situation. States can choose the right mix of generation using diverse fuels, energy efficiency and demand-side management to meet the goals and their own needs. It allows them to work alone to develop individual plans or to work together with other states to develop multi-state plans.\nAlso included in today's proposal is a flexible timeline for states to follow for submitting plans to the agency\u2014with plans due in June 2016, with the option to use a two-step process for submitting final plans if more time is needed. States that have already invested in energy efficiency programs will be able to build on these programs during the compliance period to help make progress toward meeting their goal.\nExcerpt, EPA Proposes First Guidelines to Cut Carbon Pollution from Existing Power Plants\/Clean Power Plan is flexible proposal to ensure a healthier environment, spur innovation and strengthen the economy, US EPA Press Release, June 2, 2014\nThis entry was posted in climate change, Energy, Environment, Markets, public health and tagged climate change, coal, coal plants, coal pollution, coal states United States, EPA, greenhouse gases on July 7, 2014 by Stoa.\nThe Golden Age of Coal\nCoal-fired power stations provide two-fifths of the world's electricity, and there are ever more of them. In the doubling of the world's electricity production over the past decade, two-thirds of the increase came from coal. At these rates, coal will vie with oil as the world's largest source of primary energy within five years. As recently as 2001, it was not much more than half as important as oil\nThe main factor has been the unslakable thirst for energy in China, which in 2011 overtook America as the world's biggest electricity producer. In 2001, according to the International Energy Agency, a club of rich nations, Chinese coal demand was about 600m tonnes of oil equivalent (25 exajoules). By 2011 China's coal demand had tripled\u2014a rise from two-thirds of the energy America gets from oil to twice that amount. China's domestic coal industry produces more primary energy than Middle Eastern oil does.\nOther developing economies are just as keen on coal, if not yet on such a grand scale. In India, producing 650 terawatt hours of electricity in 2010 took 311m tonnes of oil equivalent, and the power sector's coal demand is growing at around 6% a year. The IEA reckons India could surpass America as the world's second-largest coal consumer by 2017.\nMeanwhile in Europe, which likes to see itself as a world leader on climate, they are using more and more of the stuff.\nAmerica's coal business, like the rest of the country's energy industry, has been upended by the advent of shale gas, now available in unforeseen quantities at unforeseen prices. In April 2012 the price fell below $2 per million British thermal units, or Btus ($7 per megawatt hour). This has made gas increasingly attractive to power companies, which have been switching away from coal in increasing numbers.\nThe decline of coal.. will be protracted. Coal-fired power stations are built to last\u2014the oldest plant currently operating was built in the 1930s\u2014so unless new rules force them to close, they will be retired gradually. By 2017 or so, reckons Brattle Group, a consultancy, coal use will stabilise again, as gas demand finally makes gas prices dearer than coal. Coal may be down in America.

While juggling her roles as mom, teacher and student, she still found time to organize monthly events to help her community. (Photo by Melissa Spence)\nIt started with an aversion to math. And now Nisha Phillip Malahoo '21MEd is fostering a community of learning. A teacher for nearly a decade at Pinewood Elementary, a Title I school in Orange County, Malahoo works to create a classroom experience that's both exciting and engaging for students. That desire stems from her own background in school.\n\"I wanted to find a way that allowed students to embrace math rather than see it as something scary.\"\n\"Growing up, I was never great at math. In fact, I actively despised it. I did not like teaching math either,\" Malahoo says. \"I wanted to find a way that allowed students to embrace math rather than see it as something scary.\"\nMotivated to find new strategies and ways to present material that would help students embrace and enjoy their studies, Malahoo decided to apply for graduate school. A former scholar of the Lockheed Martin\/UCF Academy \u2014 an education, industry and community partnership aimed at improving mathematics, science and technology education in Central Florida \u2014 she earned a master's in K-8 mathematics and science education this summer.\n\"Graduate school allowed me to learn, unlearn and relearn,\" she says. \"The professors at Lockheed Martin Academy helped me understand the concepts behind math instead of just memorizing processes. It was like a light bulb went off. I took that confidence back into the classroom and shared it with my fellow teachers. Now I have a model classroom that other teachers visit to see how I instruct my kids.\"\nHelping Others Amid a Pandemic\nIn addition to her daily role as mom, teacher and student, Malahoo is a strong advocate for her local community. Most recently, she jumped into action after seeing the toll of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"When the pandemic hit, I noticed some parents lost their jobs and saw how it affected the kids,\" she says. \"I live in the same neighborhood as my students, so I observed their needs firsthand and knew that I needed to help.\"\nOne of her first efforts last spring focused on literacy.\n\"After school went virtual, I would check in on my students,\" she says. \"Many of them would tell me that they didn't have access to books. They weren't reading.\"\nSo Malahoo, who is also a technology trainer at the Orange County Public Library, gathered books and started lending them to students. After finishing one book, they would return it to her house and get another one.\nBut when Florida afternoon storms soaked several books left on Malahoo's porch, she explored other solutions that would provide a safe shelter to keep the book-sharing endeavor going. That's when she learned about the Little Free Library, the world's largest book-sharing movement. After being awarded a grant, Malahoo put together a Little Free Library in her front yard. Today, the small wooden structure \u2014 almost like a birdhouse for free books \u2014 provides a space for her neighbors to gather, catch up and find the next book to dig into.\nConnecting with fellow neighbors also provided Malahoo a glimpse into their lives. Through conversations, she learned about their needs \u2014 from food insecurity to homelessness, among other struggles to make ends meet. When students shared that they were going to skip Thanksgiving because they didn't have food. Malahoo sprang into action again, this time reaching out to local organizations. That's where she met and partnered with the non-profit organization Above and Beyond for Change. Together, they were able to secure more than 45 pre-cooked Thanksgiving Dinners from Publix. On Thanksgiving eve, she set up a table in her driveway and distributed the pre-cooked dinners.\nA young student hugs teacher Nisha Phillip Malahoo '21MEd during an event where she distributed 100 bikes to kids. (Photo by Melissa Spence)\nFostering a Culture of Giving Back\nMalahoo's community events and efforts soon became a monthly happening. With the continued assistance from Above and Beyond for Change, she distributed dozens of coats and jackets last December to help keep students warm in colder temperatures. Several months later, she prepared small packages of snacks as a Valentine's Day gift. Then, ahead of spring break, she rallied community members to assemble boxes of food that would ensure students and their families had at least three meals per day.\nThe events have not only helped serve those in need but have brought the community together. Local organizations, including the Orlando Police Department (OPD), join in the efforts in getting involved and"}

A bike makes their trek much easier,\" she says. \"It's also a great way to keep kids active and gets them outside more.\"\nMahaloo also partnered with Bike Walk Central Florida to secure a helmet for each child.\nAnd while school was out for the summer, she spent months organizing her most recent event, a Back-to-School Bash. The event, which saw nearly 200 children and families and hosted 20 vendors, kicked off the start of a new schoolyear.

{"text":"Irradiated Lives: Contractual Workers at the Rawatbhata Nuclear Power Plant\nA fact-finding report by\nDr. Surendra Gadekar\nDr. Sanghamitra Gadekar\nDr. Soumya Dutta\nSmita\nKumar Sundaram\nOn June 28th 2012, Rajasthan Parika, a regional Hindi daily of Rajasthan state in the western India carried a story on its front page about 38 workers in the Rawatbhata Atomic Power Station (RAPS) being exposed to tritium leak while working in the reactor no. 5. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) held a press conference next day in Mumbai. All the major national newspapers published the story only after this brief from NPCIL, reassuring about safety of the workers. While asserting that there was absolutely no leak of radiation in the atmosphere, the NPCIL's press release also mentioned that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) was yet to come up with its analysis of samples taken from the soil, air and the plant by its personnel who visited the reactor.\nIn Rawatbhata, workers denied right to know radioactive exposure\nThe accident had actually happened at RAPS 5 days previously. It came to light only after the workers raised their voice and demanded proper medical investigation, treatment and compensation from the plant operators. For five days, they were silenced through misleading claims, alluring promises and outright intimidation by the authorities.\nIn recent few years, there have been at least two more reported incidents of tritium contamination \u2013 Kakrapar (Gujarat) in September 2011 where the NPCIL after initial denials accepted that 6 workers were exposed to radiation but callously blamed the workers for over-blowing the incident in order to get permanent employment. In 2010, a similar incident happened in Kaiga (Karnataka) where tritium tube was put into normal water tank used for washing purposes. The NPCIL promptly termed it an internal sabotage and constituted an inquiry committee.\nConsidering the seriousness of these incidents and their implications for nuclear safety in the wake of India's massive nuclear expansion underway, some independent experts and concerned individuals went to Rawatbhata to do a preliminary investigation. Amongst them Dr. Surendra Gadekar and Dr. Sanghamitra Gadekar (a physicist and a medical doctor who have conducted health survey around RAPS in the past.) Besides them, the team included environmentalist Dr. Soumya Dutta of Bharat Jan Vigyan Jattha, Sunil and Smita, both prominent social activists, and Kumar Sundaram, an independent researcher.\nThe team visited Rawatbhata on 10-11 July, 2012. It spoke to the contractual workers employed in the RAPS, including Mr. Nandkishore Mehar \u2013 one of the 2 workers whose exposure to tritium beyond the acceptable limits the NPCIL has admitted. The team also met Mr. Mansingh Solanki, the General Secretary of the Anushakti DR Shamik Sangh, a collective of the contractual workers, referred to as Daily Rated (DR) workers in RAPS. He discussed at length about the criminal negligence and brazen violations of workers' rights faced by the contractual workers at RAPS. The team also met some senior local journalists, concerned citizen and activists of the Parmanu Pradushan Virodhi Morcha (People's Front Against Nuclear Pollution) who have been raising the issues pertaining to nuclear risks and worker's safety at Rawatbhata.\nA short preliminary report of the findings of this independent investigation team is given below:\nContractual Labour in Nuclear Power Plants at Rawatbhata:\nRawabhata houses a total of 6 operational reacors. 2 more units, No. 7 and 8, are under construction. Rawatbhata is one of the earliest PHWR nuclear sites in India. These reactors are cooled by heavy water (D2O). A total of 2900 workers are employed in the RAPS on daily rate basis while only a total of 126 workers are permanent employees of NPCIL. Although the AERB stipulations prohibit employing contractual workers in the nuclear sector, more so in the radiation work, owing to safety issues and sensitive nature of the industry, engaging casual workers has been a common practice in the Indian nuclear sector. Although the NPCIL maintains that the contractual workers are engaged mainly in maintenance, cleaning and non-sensitive work, it is in these work areas of maintenance and repair that the workers are typically most exposed to radiation. The permanent employees confine themselves to supervision while they delegate all the dirty and risky work to contractual labour, defying all norms of safety and accountability.\nThe DR workers are deprived of any health benefits and social security. There is no health testing and adequate training on radiation risks before these workers are employed, Although the NPCIL does claim that these workers are provided with dosimeters before entering radiation zones and are allowed"}
{"text":" to work for limited time under constant supervision, it has been reported in the past in several cases that the workers as well as their employers circumvent these norms through various means. Contractual workers are afraid of loosing their jobs if they receive radiation doses above normal, so they find ways to hide or under-report.\nEarlier, the plant authorities used to hire the contractual workers directly. The common practice was to terminate their services a day before they completed 90 days of work (later revised to 240 days) a period after which they can claim permanent employment. But in the recent years, the NPCIL has started hiring them through labour contractors, making the workers more vulnerable. The NPCIL thus frees itself of all responsibilities towards the weakest links in the nuclear human chain. Although the same workers keep working in the same plan for several years and mostly in same working areas, their contractors keep changing and hence they never become technically eligible for regular employment and other work related benefits.\nIn recent years, the NPCIL's labour contractors at the RAPS have been arbitrarily lowering the DR worker's wages and changing their status from skilled to semi-skilled and non-skilled categories. The DR workers have collectively agitated against such moves and the RAPS has responded with vindictive attitude towards the leading voices of these struggles. Last year, the RAPS agreed to the DR workers demands in presence of the local MLA and Member of Parliament Ms Girija Vyas, only to back off from its promises soon and suspend the DR workers' union's leaders.\nThe incident on June 23\nThe tritium leak in RAPS-5 took place on June 23 when the plant was in shut down mode and maintenance work was underway. As part of the NPCIL's efforts to beef up the safety of its nuclear reactors after Fukushima, addiional apparatus based on the principle of passive cooling were being installed in RAPS-5's calendria. Apparently the regular staff of the RAPS and even the special team invited from Narora atomic power station for this purpose declined to perform the task manually, Nandkishore and his 3 other friends were ordered to do the welding in the heavy water pipe. Nandkishore is among the 2 workers whose exposure to radiation far beyond the \"permissible limit\" has been accepted by the NPCIL. While at least a total of 45 workers present in the area were exposed to various levels of radiation, Krishnapal Singh, Gautam Sonwane and Gulab Singh received doses of 21.5, 45.5 and 16.4 mSv each while Nandkishor himself got exposed to 84.5 mSv of radiation. The NPCIL's permissible annual limit for contractual workers is 15 mSv.\nNandkishor described the events of the fateful day and the ensuing callousness of the plant authorities in detail.\nOn Saturday afternoon, June 23, Nandkishore was asked to work on the welding for more than 4 hours while the maximum time allowed in radiation zone is just 30 minutes. He went out of the plant only after 5 pm, only to have tea and return back. In this break, he also underwent a urine test and found his radiation exposure reaching 78.56 rems. The dosimeter provided by RAPS had already crossed the maximum limit so he was issued a new meter by the supervisor, much to his surprise. Before he left for home at 9 pm, he was once again asked to undergo urine test.\nNext morning, he was called by his supervisor to report to the plant as soon as possible and was asked again to undergo urine test. When he went back home after the day's work, he got a call from the incharge around 9 pm and was asked to report at the plant with his other 3 friends who were with him on Saturday. When he told his senior that there is no bus available for the plant, he was asked to report at the earliest even if I meant he and his friends riding 2 motorbikes and reaching the plant. The security personnel at the gate and other check-points hurriedly letting him go without any checking seemed eerie to him as it is totally unusual. Late night, he again gave urine samples. His bosses asked him to take lots of water.\nBeen irradiated? Drink Beer!\nWhen Nandkishor and his friends asked if anything serious had happened and they should be provided with proper information and treatment, the officials asked them to drink beer regularly. They were offered Rs 200 extra daily, raised to 300 easily when one of them said it meant just 2 bottles of beer. This additional money was stopped after a week or so, and they were told that the tritium taken inside must have gone out of their bodies by now. The workers asked for proper medical checkups and treatment but were repeatedly denied. When they asked for compensation and also permanent employment to ensure financial security and access to RAPS health facilities and other benefits, these were plainly denied by their bosses. It was after repeated failures to get any hearing from"}
{"text":" RAPS bosses that they approached the local administration and the media.\nThey kept requesting Chandra Prakash Jha, Project Director of No 5 reactor, and R K Agarwal, Station Director of RAPS, on phone about proper treatment and protection and kept appraising him of their developing symptoms of exhaustion, dizziness and constant trembling of limbs, they were told not to get swayed by \"outsiders\". When Nandkishor asked for his medical reports, the officials refused. They were called for a meeting with the seniors where they were warned of meeting the same fate as of Mansingh and other workers who were suspended for protesting against reversal of wages.\nAwakening: Songs for Social and Environmental Justice October 17, 2011"}

As a result, the European Union adopted various measures concerning a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, measures relating to effort sharing between the Member States, carbon capture and storage, the quality of petrol and diesel fuels, and reducing CO2 emissions for motor vehicles, and measures relating to accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from activities relating to land use, land use change and forestry.\n3 In view of the expiry of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2020, the Paris Agreement was adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015, aiming to limit the global temperature increase to between 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2016 the European Union ratified that agreement (Council Decision (EU) 2016\/1841 of 5 October 2016 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (OJ 2016 L 282, p. 1)).\n4 The Paris Agreement focuses on the concept of 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs). Article 4(2) thereof provides as follows:\n'Each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.'\n5 The European Union and its Member States have committed jointly to complying, by means of their NDCs, with a binding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union by at least 40% by 2030 in relation to 1990 levels.\n6 The following acts (collectively, 'the contested acts' or 'the legislative package') are the"}

Article 9 of Directive 2003\/87, entitled 'Union-wide quantity of allowances', provides as follows in paragraph 1 thereof:\n'The Union-wide quantity of allowances issued each year starting in 2013 shall decrease in a linear manner beginning from the mid-point of the period from 2008 to 2012.

In the present case, as the Parliament and the Council have requested a ruling on inadmissibility, the Court, considering that it has sufficient information from the documents in the case file, hereby decides to give a ruling regarding that request without taking further steps in the proceedings.\n22 The applicants seek, first, in the context of the action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU, the annulment in part of Directive 2018\/410, in particular Article 1 thereof, Regulation 2018\/842, in particular Article 4(2) thereof and Annex I thereto, and Regulation 2018\/841, in particular Article 4 thereof, and, second, in the context of non-contractual liability under Articles 268 and 340 TFEU, an injunction obliging the co-legislators"}
{"text":" to adopt measures'requiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by at least 50% to 60% compared to their 1990 levels, or by such higher level of reduction as the Court shall deem appropriate'.\n23 To summarise, regarding the action for annulment, the applicants submit that the Union's level of ambition is not sufficiently high with regard to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and infringes binding higher-ranking rules of law. They argue that the technical and economic capacity of the European Union extends to reducing those emissions by 50% to 60%, which is why the legislative package must be annulled in so far as it will allow for emissions in 2030 at a level that is higher than 40% to 50% of 1990 levels.\n24 Regarding the action for damages, the applicants argue that the non-contractual liability of the European Union has been triggered inasmuch as, by failing to comply with higher-ranking rules of law, the European Union has caused them damage for which they request compensation in kind in the form of an injunction. That damage is both current and future and consists in their living conditions being adversely affected, in particular in so far as climate change, to which greenhouse gas emissions directly contribute, curtails their activities and their livelihoods and results in physical damage. As is apparent from the reports of the World Bank and UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund), heatwaves are already causing damage to human health, in particular to children, and to persons whose professions are dependent on moderate temperatures, such as in the agriculture and tourism sectors.\nAdmissibility of the claim for annulment\nArguments of the parties\n25 The Council contends that, notwithstanding the immense volume of documentation appended to the application, the applicants have not shown that any of the contested acts has affected their legal situation. Indeed, the applicants seek only to show that their factual situation has been, or is likely to be affected. The Council also contends that all the contested acts in fact require or enable both the Member States and the Commission to take action to comply with the basic obligations laid down therein or to go beyond such obligations, so that there is at least some discretion that, in any event, precludes the applicants from being directly concerned. The Council also points to the fact that all the acts concerned were adopted under Article 192 TFEU and that Article 193 TFEU states that the Member States may take more stringent protective measures than those set out in acts adopted under Article 192 TFEU.\n26 Next, the Council contends that the part of the application relating to individual concern is confused because the applicants disregard the conditions of eligibility for bringing proceedings. In the Council's view, accepting the applicants' argument whereby each of them claims that their fundamental rights have been infringed would render the condition of individual concern entirely meaningless.\n27 The Parliament is also of the view that the contested acts do not directly affect the applicants' legal situation. In that regard, the Parliament remarks that the contested provisions setting the target levels of greenhouse gas emissions are not, in themselves, capable of affecting the fundamental rights invoked by the applicants. According to the Parliament, in order for those rights to be capable of being affected, the greenhouse gas emissions must first take place, via authorisations to emit or via the allocation of emission allowances to economic operators. However, the legislative package does not 'authorise' any person to emit greenhouse gases. Indeed, it lays down the minimum requirements with which Member States must comply in order to reduce emissions and, accordingly, combat climate change. The Parliament adds that the legislative package also confers some discretion on the national authorities tasked with its implementation.\n28 Regarding individual concern, the Parliament contends that the contested provisions are of a general nature and that they can be applied to any natural or legal person and apply to an indeterminate number of natural and legal persons. It maintains that the applicants have not produced the slightest evidence to show that the legislative package would alter the rights that they had acquired prior to the adoption of that package in accordance with the cases giving rise to the judgments of 18 May 1994, Codorniu v Council (C\u2011309\/89, EU:C:1994:197), and of 13 March 2008, Commission v Infront WM (C\u2011125\/06 P, EU:C:2008:159). In addition, the applicants' argument that 'each applicant is affected by climate change \u2026 idiosyncratically and is therefore distinguished from all other persons' is fallacious from a logical perspective. It implies that, besides the applicants, each and every person around the world is individually concerned by the legislative package. However, suggesting that all persons are individually concerned by the contested acts is a blatant contradiction of the case-law criterion resulting from the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25\/62, EU:C:1963:17), which requires the existence of genuine distinguishing features. Moreover, as regards fundamental rights and effective judicial protection, the Parliament recalls that, according to the case-law, a claim that an act of"}
{"text":" general application infringes those rules or those rights is not in itself sufficient to establish that the action brought by an individual is admissible, without running the risk of rendering the requirements of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU meaningless, as long as that alleged infringement does not distinguish the applicant individually just as in the case of the addressee. In that context, the Parliament also recalls that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has established, by Articles 263 and 277 thereof, on the one hand, and Article 267 thereof, on the other, a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of acts of the Union.\n29 Lastly, the Parliament contends that the action is inadmissible because the applicants are seeking the annulment of provisions that cannot be severed from the remainder of the legislative package.\n30 The applicants maintain that they are directly concerned by the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets laid down by the legislative package. The legislative package directly affects their legal situation, given that, by requiring an insufficient reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and thereby allocating and authorising an excessive volume of emissions, it infringes their fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, namely the right to life (Article 2), the right to the integrity of the person (Article 3), the rights of the child (Article 24), the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation (Article 15), the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16), the right to property (Article 17) and the right to equal treatment (Articles 20 and 21).\n31 The applicants argue that they are also individually concerned. In that regard, they emphasise that they are each claiming an infringement of their individual fundamental rights as listed in paragraph 30 above. The effects of climate change, to which the legislative package contributes, and, accordingly, the infringement of those rights will be unique to and different for each individual. According to the applicants, a farmer affected by drought is in a different situation to a farmer whose land is flooded and made saltier by seawater. Even within a group of farmers affected by drought, each farmer will experience the effects differently.\n32 In the alternative, the applicants request that the concept of individual concern set out in the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25\/62, EU:C:1963:17), be interpreted more flexibly. In their view, the case-law criterion arising from that judgment is unsuitable and it is inappropriate to apply it in the present case, given that it reflects an outdated line of case-law manifesting itself in paradoxical outcomes. The more widespread the harmful effects of an act, the more restricted the access to the courts. In other words, the more serious the damage and the higher the number of affected persons, the less judicial protection is available. It follows that there is an obvious shortfall in terms of judicial protection. The applicants thus recall and maintain the following:\n\u2013 their argument is based on the case-law that recognises that infringement of fundamental rights is a ground for individual concern;\n\u2013 if the Courts of the European Union are indeed to be the sole arbiters of the reconciliation of EU measures with fundamental rights, an individual whose fundamental rights are at stake must necessarily have a right of access to those courts;\n\u2013 a broadening in the present case of the narrow interpretation that characterises the criterion set out in the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25\/62, EU:C:1963:17), would lead to a situation that would be more in line with the locus standi requirements set out in Article 9(3) of the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998;\n\u2013 a narrow interpretation of the concept of 'direct and individual concern' would, if applied in the present case, infringe the guarantee of judicial protection offered by Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, pursuant to which 'everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy';\n\u2013 the Parliament's argument that they have the possibility to obtain an 'effective remedy' before a national court is not convincing, given that an action before the national courts is hypothetical and infeasible in the circumstances of the present case; in order to obtain a result sufficient to reduce total EU emissions to a level consistent with the law, each applicant would be obliged to bring proceedings before the courts of all the Member States; in addition, the diversity of judicial procedures and legal remedies means it is almost certain that an effective remedy would be impossible in this case; moreover, an action before a national court hearing a challenge to the measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions adopted by a Member State cannot give rise to a suitable reference for a preliminary ruling contesting the legislative package.\nFindings of the Court\n33 As indicated in paragraphs 25 to 29 above"}
{"text":", the Parliament and the Council are pleading the inadmissibility of the action for annulment on the ground that, in essence, the applicants do not have standing to bring proceedings under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU. In their view, the applicants are neither directly nor individually concerned by the legislative package.\n34 Under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, any natural or legal person may institute proceedings against an act addressed to that person or that is of direct and individual concern to them, and against a regulatory act that is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.\n35 In the present case, it must be pointed out that the legislative package does not identify the applicants as addressees thereof. In those circumstances, the first scenario in which a natural or legal person has standing to bring proceedings under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU must be excluded.\n36 It is therefore necessary to examine whether the second or even the third scenario in which, under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, a natural or legal person is to be recognised as having standing to bring an action against an act that is not addressed to them may correspond to the present case. According to the second scenario, an action may be brought if the act is of direct and individual concern to the natural or legal person bringing the action. According to the third scenario, such a person may bring proceedings against a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures if that act is of direct concern to them (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telef\u00f3nica v Commission, C\u2011274\/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 19; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C\u2011132\/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 44; and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission, C\u2011133\/12 P, EU:C:2014:105, paragraph 31).\n37 In the first place, regarding the third scenario referred to in paragraph 36 above, according to which natural or legal persons, such as the applicants, may, under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, bring an action against a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures if that act is of direct concern to them, it is necessary to examine whether the acts constituting the legislative package are regulatory acts.\n38 In that regard, first, it should be borne in mind that, according to the case-law, the meaning of'regulatory act' for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU must be understood as covering all acts of general application apart from legislative acts (judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C\u2011583\/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraphs 60 and 61; order of 6 September 2011, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, T\u201118\/10, EU:T:2011:419, paragraph 56; and judgment of 25 October 2011, Microban International and Microban (Europe) v Commission, T\u2011262\/10, EU:T:2011:623, paragraph 21).\n39 Second, the test for distinguishing between a legislative act and a regulatory act is based, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on the criterion of the procedure, legislative or not, that led to its adoption (order of 6 September 2011, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, T\u201118\/10, EU:T:2011:419, paragraph 65).\n40 In the present case, it should be noted that, as is apparent from the recitals set out in the preamble to the contested acts constituting the legislative package, those acts were adopted on the basis of Article 192(1) TFEU. That article states that the Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, are to decide what action is to be taken by the Union in order to achieve the objectives referred to in Article 191 TFEU. That article concerns the Union's policy on the environment.\n41 Therefore, it must be concluded that the three contested acts are legislative acts, not regulatory acts, for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 39 above, which, moreover, is not contested by the applicants.\n42 Accordingly, and without there being any need to examine whether the other conditions of the third scenario set out in paragraph 36 above, concerning the lack of implementing measures and direct concern on the part of the applicants, are satisfied, it is not possible to establish the admissibility of the present action on that basis.\n43 In the second place, it is necessary to examine the admissibility of the present action having regard to the second scenario referred to in paragraph 36 above"}
{"text":", according to which natural or legal persons, such as the applicants, may bring an action for annulment under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU against an act that is not addressed to them, provided that that act is of direct and individual concern to them.\n44 Regarding the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Parliament and the Council on the ground that the applicants are neither directly nor individually concerned by the legislative package, it must first be examined whether the second condition, relating to the individual concern of the applicants, is satisfied. Since the direct concern and individual concern conditions are cumulative (judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C\u2011583\/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 76), if the applicants are not individually concerned by the legislative package, it will become unnecessary to enquire whether that package is of direct concern to them (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission, 25\/62, EU:C:1963:17, p. 223).\n45 According to settled case-law, natural or legal persons satisfy the condition of individual concern only if the contested act affects them by reason of certain attributes that are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons, and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the addressee (judgments of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission, 25\/62, EU:C:1963:17, p. 223; of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C\u2011583\/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 72; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C\u2011132\/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 57; and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission, C\u2011133\/12 P, EU:C:2014:105, paragraph 44).\n46 In the present case, it should be observed at the outset that the applicants are claiming an infringement of their fundamental rights. They infer from this that they are individually concerned, given that, although all persons may in principle each enjoy the same right (such as the right to life or the right to work), the effects of climate change and, by extension, the infringement of fundamental rights is unique to and different for each individual.\n47 Such an argument cannot succeed.\n48 It is apparent from the case-law that, although it is true that, when adopting an act of general application, the institutions of the Union are required to respect higher-ranking rules of law, including fundamental rights, the claim that such an act infringes those rules or rights is not sufficient in itself to establish that the action brought by an individual is admissible, without running the risk of rendering the requirements of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU meaningless, as long as that alleged infringement does not distinguish the applicant individually just as in the case of the addressee (see judgment of 2 March 2010, Arcelor v Parliament and Council, T\u201116\/04, EU:T:2010:54, paragraph 103 and the case-law cited).\n49 The applicants have not established that the contested provisions of the legislative package infringed their fundamental rights and distinguished them individually from all other natural or legal persons concerned by those provisions just as in the case of the addressee.\n50 It is true that every individual is likely to be affected one way or another by climate change, that issue being recognised by the European Union and the Member States who have, as a result, committed to reducing emissions. However, the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another does not mean that, for that reason, there exists standing to bring an action against a measure of general application. As can be seen from the case-law cited in paragraph 48 above, a different approach would have the result of rendering the requirements of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU meaningless and of creating locus standi for all without the criterion of individual concern within the meaning of the case-law resulting from the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25\/62, EU:C:1963:17), being fulfilled.\n51 So far as concerns the association S\u00e1minuorra, it should be pointed out, in the first place, that, like the other applicants and for the same reason, that applicant has not shown that it was individually concerned. In the second place, it is settled case-law that actions for annulment brought by associations have been held to be admissible in three types of situation: firstly, where a legal provision expressly grants a series of procedural powers to trade associations; secondly, where the association represents the interests of its members, who"}
{"text":" would themselves be entitled to bring proceedings; and, thirdly, where the association is distinguished individually because its own interests as an association are affected, in particular because its negotiating position has been affected by the act in respect of which annulment is sought (see order of 23 November 1999, Uni\u00f3n de Peque\u00f1os Agricultores v Council, T\u2011173\/98, EU:T:1999:296, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited). In the present case, the association S\u00e1minuorra has not shown that it satisfied one of those conditions.\n52 Next, as regards the applicants' argument that the interpretation of the concept of 'individual concern' referred to in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU is incompatible with the fundamental right to effective judicial protection inasmuch as it results in a directly applicable regulation being virtually immune to judicial review, it should be pointed out that the protection conferred by Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights does not require that an individual should have an unconditional entitlement to bring an action for annulment of such a legislative act of the Union directly before the Courts of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C\u2011583\/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 105).\n53 Lastly, as is highlighted by the Parliament and the Council, the implementation of the legislative package presupposes that such implementation will be carried out by means of legislative or regulatory provisions by the Commission and the Member States, such as the allocation of allowances and the putting in place of measures to avoid exceeding the limits fixed by each Member State with regard to emissions. In that context, it should be borne in mind that Articles 263 and 277 TFEU, on the one hand, and Article 267 TFEU, on the other, have established a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of the acts of the institutions, entrusting such review to the Courts of the European Union. Under that system, where natural or legal persons cannot, by reason of the conditions for admissibility laid down in Article 263 TFEU, directly challenge acts of the Union such as those at issue in the present case, they are able, depending on the case, to plead the invalidity of such acts either indirectly, under Article 277 TFEU, before the Courts of the European Union, or before the national courts and to ask them, since they have no jurisdiction themselves to declare those acts invalid, to question the Court in that regard through questions referred for a preliminary ruling (see, to that effect, order of 29 April 2015, von Storch and Others v ECB, C\u201164\/14 P, not published, EU:C:2015:300, paragraph 50 and the case-law cited).\n54 Accordingly, it must be found that the applicants are not individually concerned by the contested acts for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 45 above.\n55 Furthermore, that finding cannot be called in question by the case-law referred to by the applicants, namely the judgment of 18 May 1994, Codorniu v Council (C\u2011309\/89, EU:C:1994:197). Indeed, the case giving rise to that judgment concerned the loss of a specific acquired right, namely the right to use the word 'cr\u00e9mant' in a registered graphic mark. In the present case, the applicants have not claimed the loss of a specific acquired right.\nAdmissibility of the claim for damages\n56 The Council contends, making reference to the case-law relating to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the European Union in connection with actions for annulment, that the request for an injunction must be refused on the ground of the Court's manifest lack of jurisdiction.\n57 The Parliament argues, in the first place, that the claim for compensation is inadmissible, because it is intrinsically linked to an action for annulment that is itself inadmissible.\n58 In that regard, the Parliament, having recalled the case-law pursuant to which an action for damages is an autonomous legal remedy, so that a declaration of inadmissibility of the claim for annulment does not automatically render the claim for damages inadmissible and that that principle is limited by the prohibition of abuse of the proceedings, argues that the claim for compensation \u2014 in so far as it does not seek compensation for damages but an injunction obliging the European Union to adopt certain legislative acts \u2014 is based on the same legislative package as that concerned by the action for annulment and that, in those circumstances, it is pursuing the same objective as the action for annulment. There is therefore a direct link between the claim for damages and the claim for annulment. Given that both claims concern the same alleged unlawfulness and the claim for annulment is inadmissible, the claim for compensation should also be declared inadmissible.\n59"}
{"text":" In the second place, the Parliament contends that the action for damages is inadmissible because it in fact seeks to obtain an injunction. More specifically, the Parliament contends that the applicants are attempting, by their request for an injunction in connection with an action for compensation, to circumvent the rule whereby the Court does not have jurisdiction to order such an injunction in the context of a review of legality under Article 263 TFEU.\n60 In the last place, for the sake of completeness, the Parliament maintains that the action for damages is manifestly lacking any foundation in law, so that it is possible to dismiss it, pursuant to Article 126 of the Rules of Procedure, without having to rule on the plea of inadmissibility. In that regard, the Parliament argues that, without there being a need to rule on the legality of the legislative package and the question whether the alleged unlawfulness of that legislative package constitutes a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of law the purpose of which is to confer rights on individuals, there is no direct and specific link between the conduct of the Union legislature and the damage that the applicants claim to have suffered. In that connection, the Parliament remarks that climate change is global and that the Union, even by reducing all its emissions to zero, is not in a position to overcome climate change by itself. In addition, while it does not deny the reality of climate change, the extent to which the alleged damage is a result of that change (and not of other natural phenomena or other human activities not linked to climate change) has not been definitively established. Lastly, according to the Parliament, it is also not established that the alleged damage is a result of the alleged lack of efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, rather than the lack of efforts to adapt (which falls within the Member States' competences).\n61 The applicants argue that their claim for compensation under Article 340 TFEU is admissible.\n62 In that regard, the applicants recall that an action for damages is an autonomous legal remedy and that the conditions for triggering the non-contractual liability of the Union, namely unlawful conduct, damage and a causal link, are satisfied.\n63 The applicants dispute the Parliament's allegation of abuse of the proceedings. According to the case-law, that concept applies only in the exceptional cases where an action for damages is seeking payment of a sum in precisely the same amount as the sum that an applicant could have obtained in an action for annulment that was not brought. In the present case, an action for annulment has been brought and, furthermore, the claim in the two actions is not identical. While the basis of the request for an injunction is the protection of the applicants' individual interests and the request was made inter partes, the claim for annulment merely seeks an annulment erga omnes. The aim of the injunction is to prevent the Union from committing acts that would cause the applicants damage as private parties and its adoption would lead to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to avoid adding to the damage suffered. The fact that that injunction would bring advantages from which all would benefit, given the characteristics of the climate system, is irrelevant for the purposes of examining the admissibility of the request.\n64 The applicants also dispute the Parliament's argument that there is no causal link. In their view, issues of causation essentially require consideration of the facts, assessed in the light of legal policy. The applicants therefore dispute the Parliament's criticisms and note that these are relatively complex issues that will be examined in their entirety during the decision on the merits and that cannot be resolved in isolation, regardless of the facts and without all their arguments being heard.\n65 It should be borne in mind, in the first place, that the remedy of an action for damages was introduced as an autonomous form of action, with a particular purpose to fulfil within the system of actions and subject to conditions on its use dictated by its specific nature (judgment of 2 December 1971, Zuckerfabrik Sch\u00f6ppenstedt v Council, 5\/71, EU:C:1971:116, paragraph 3), so that the inadmissibility of the claim for annulment does not automatically entail the inadmissibility of the claim for damages (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 February 1986, Krohn Import-Export v Commission, 175\/84, EU:C:1986:85, paragraph 32).\n66 That principle is limited by the prohibition on abuse of the proceedings. An applicant may not, by means of an action for damages, attempt to obtain a result similar to the result of annulling the act, where an action for annulment concerning that act would be inadmissible (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 1966, Schreckenberg v Commission, 59\/65, EU:C:1966:60, p. 797).\n67 In that regard, it should be pointed out that the claim seeking annulment of the legislative package and the injunction requested in connection with the action for damages are almost"}
{"text":" identical and concern the same alleged unlawfulness. In the action for annulment, the applicants have argued that the target set by the three contested acts, namely a 40% reduction in emissions, is manifestly inadequate, which is why that target should be annulled and reviewed. In the action for damages, they seek, instead of pecuniary damages for their alleged individual losses, compensation in the form of an injunction ordering the Union to adopt measures to put an end to its unlawful and harmful conduct. The applicants therefore request that the Parliament and the Council be ordered to adopt measures under the legislative package requiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by at least 50% to 60% compared to 1990 levels.\n68 It is clear from the action as a whole that the action for damages is not seeking compensation for damage attributable to an unlawful act or omission but amendment of the legislative package.\n69 Both by their claim for annulment and by their request for an injunction, the applicants are seeking to obtain the same result, namely the replacement of the contested provisions of the legislative package at issue with new measures that will have to achieve a greater reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than is laid down currently.\n70 Given that the applicants do not have locus standi and that, accordingly, they may not request annulment in part of the legislative package, it follows that their action for compensation, which in reality seeks to achieve the same result, must also be declared inadmissible.\n71 In the light of the foregoing, the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Parliament and the Council must be upheld and the action must accordingly be dismissed as inadmissible in its entirety.\n72 Pursuant to Article 144(3) of the Rules of Procedure, where the defendant lodges a plea of inadmissibility or of lack of competence, as provided in Article 130(1) of those rules, a decision on applications for leave to intervene is not to be given until after the plea has been rejected or the decision on the plea reserved. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 142(2) of the Rules of Procedure, an intervention is ancillary to the main proceedings and becomes devoid of purpose, inter alia, when the application is declared inadmissible.\n73 In the present case, since the action is being dismissed in its entirety, there is no longer any need to adjudicate on the applications for leave to intervene submitted by Climate Action Network, WeMove Europe, Arbeitsgemeinschaft B\u00e4uerliche Landwirtschaft and the Commission.\n75 As the applicants have been unsuccessful, they must be ordered to bear their own costs and to pay those incurred by the Parliament and the Council, in accordance with the form of order sought by those parties.\n76 Furthermore, pursuant to Article 144(10) of the Rules of Procedure, Climate Action Network Europe, WeMove Europe, Arbeitsgemeinschaft B\u00e4uerliche Landwirtschaft and the Commission are to bear their own costs in relation to their applications for leave to intervene.\nTHE GENERAL COURT (Second Chamber)\nhereby orders:\n1.

It will also go towards: Adding a glass atrium and roof to the existing garden in the Visiting Center; New water\/sewer lines; New electric distribution; and An underground storm retention basin. \"Both the Zoo and Eastern State Penitentiary are area landmarks that not only gives us a place to connect with family and friends, but attracts people from across the country right to our neighborhoods,\" Bullock, D-Phila., said. \"This funding is essential to ensure these tourist attractions continue to succeed, strengthen our local economy, and shine a positive light on our community.\" RACP is administered by the Office of the Budget for the acquisition and Read more\nPLBC applauds state funding for gun violence reduction initiatives\nHARRISBURG, Sept. 7 \u2013 Members of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus applauded the announcement made today by Gov.

{"text":"ALLAS, Aug. 23 \u2013 A joint state House-Senate Democratic Legislative Policy Committee hearing was held Wednesday at the State Correctional Institute in Luzerne County to discuss proposals aimed at reforming the state's justice and prison systems. Held at SCI-Dallas at the request of Rep. Jordan Harris, Rep. Donna Bullock and Sen. Sharif Street, all D-Phila., the hearing focused on S.B. 942 that would provide the possibility of parole for model prisoners serving life sentences. The legislation would enable someone sentenced to life imprisonment to be considered for parole after spending at least 15 years in prison. The state Board of Probation and Parole could still reject parole requests from those who do not deserve it or pose a safety risk to the public. Rep. Jason Dawkins, D-Phila., has introduced companion legislation ( H.B. 135 ) in the House of Representatives. Harris, chairman of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and co-sponsor of the recently-enacted clean slate law, said: \"Yesterday's policy hearing and tour of SCI-Dallas was a historic moment. Both House and Senate Democratic Policy committees along with the PLBC joined to hear from a group of constituents often forgotten about. In this time of fiscal crisis, it's the legislature's responsibility to ensure that we are good stewards of taxpayer dollars.

Morgan Cephas, D-Phila., and colleagues today unveiled a package of legislation that would help incarcerated women and parents in Pennsylvania. \"I'm glad that we're having vital, bipartisan discussions about criminal justice reform. I think it's crucial for those discussions to include women and girls of color,\" said Cephas, chairwoman of the Women and Girls of Color Subcommittee of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus. \"Women are the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population. Since 1985, the rate of incarcerated women has increased at nearly double the male rate. The ACLU reports that African-American women and women of color are significantly overrepresented in the prison population. African-American women are 30 percent of incarcerated women in the United States, but only 13 percent of the female population. In addition, Hispanic women are 16 percent of incarcerated women but only 11 percent of all women in the U.S.\" Cephas plans to introduce a bill to create a Women and Girls Committee within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. \"I believe this would aid the commission in its work as it specifically relates to research and programs that will have a direct impact on women and girls.\" Rep.

Today is Equal Pay Day, the symbolic day when women's average earnings catch up to men's from the previous year. \"Our state ranks 29th in the United States for pay equity. Women in Pennsylvania on average make 79 percent of what men make. It takes women an additional four months and four days to get paid the same as their male counterparts.

{"text":"AFRICA TOP 10\nSouth African Workers Strike as Inflation Hits its Highest Rate Since 2009\nThousands of workers took to the streets in all nine provinces to demand, among other things, a basic income grant, a better minimum wage, and a cap on fuel prices and interest rates. They also want the ongoing problems at the state-owned supplier of electricity, Eskom, to be resolved so that businesses stop losing work due to power cuts. Azar Jammine, chief economist at consultancy firm Econometrix, said the July inflation rate of 7.8 percent was expected. The $88 basic income grant demanded by of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) is unrealistic, Jammine added. Economist Lebohang Pheko, a senior research fellow at the Trade Collective research group, disagreed. \"My question is, can we afford not to?\" Pheko said. \"I think the notion of a basic income which is able to deal with things like hunger at household level and at childhood level which has other impacts like stunting, cognitive functioning at a very crucial developmental age is quite important.\" Ironically, COSATU, which initially called for the protests, is an alliance partner with the ruling African National Congress party, which has been in power since 1994.\nSOURCE: VOA\nPrevious Senegalese-born Tiktoker Gets Italian Citizenship\nNext Observers Laud Angola's Peaceful Poll\nMo Ibrahim's Index Looks at Africa's State of Governance\nFrance to Give Burkina Faso What It Wants\nAfrica Has to Work on Feeding Itself\nMali Basketballer Disappointed with Treatment after Whistleblowing\nKenya Changes the Rules of Engagement\nFor Many, the Pope's Visit is the Peace they Need\nAlgeria Unveils Series of Policies Aimed at Eliminating its Dependence on Fossil Fuels\nLagos Seaport Garners Support from the Masses\nSierra Leone Women Given Right to Own Land\nHistory About East Africa's Art Scene\nUganda Launches its First Oil Drilling Programme\nLooking at a Decade of Uber's Operations in Africa"}

{"text":"Policy Hub \u00bb International\nBob Perciasepe's statement on the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement\nOn President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement:\nIt is profoundly disappointing that President Trump is ignoring the many U.S. business leaders \u2013 and the strong majority of Americans \u2013 who want the U.S. to stay in the Paris Agreement. By withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, the president is not only damaging the global climate effort. He is shirking U.S. responsibilities, severely undermining U.S. interests, and putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage.\nOther countries are very unlikely to be interested in renegotiating the Paris Agreement or in negotiating an alternative agreement. But the United States still retains the right to adjust the terms of its participation in the Paris Agreement by revising its target. We encourage the president to keep that option on the table as he seeks a \"fairer\" deal.\nThe president's decision reflects a fundamental misreading of the economic stakes. As many of America's leading companies made clear in full-page ads urging the president to stay in Paris, climate change poses significant economic risks, while climate solutions present enormous economic opportunities. The U.S. clean energy economy is expanding 12 times faster than the economy as a whole, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Weakening the U.S. effort and abandoning the Paris Agreement will handicap U.S. companies in rapidly expanding clean energy markets and could expose them to retaliatory trade measures.\nFortunately, in the absence of federal leadership, we can count on cities, states, and businesses to continue leading the U.S. climate effort. With U.S. emissions at a 25-year low, there is strong momentum toward continued reductions. But the fact remains \u2013 we ultimately will need robust federal leadership to achieve the steeper reductions needed by mid-century.\nIt is also fortunate that other nations remain so strongly committed to the Paris Agreement and to doing their part in the global climate effort. The door will remain open to the U.S. to rejoin the agreement, hopefully with a renewed commitment to doing its fair share.\nC2ES will continue working with other governments around the world to see the agreement effectively implemented, and with U.S. city, state, and business leaders to continue making progress at home in the spirit of the Paris Agreement.\nTo speak to a C2ES expert, contact press@c2es.org or call 703-516-0621.\nAbout C2ES: The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization working to forge practical solutions to climate change.

{"text":"More Employment Potential in Renewables than Fossil Fuels\nA new report suggests that rather than expanding its exploitation of fossil fuels Canada should explore the economic and employment benefits from ramping up renewable energy. Economic concerns are a salient reason why some resist replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. However a new report suggests that transitioning away from fossil fuels would not compromise economic growth or jobs.\nThis research does not factor the disastrous economic and health impacts associated with hydrocarbons.\nA number of studies have shown that the benefits of acting on climate change far exceed the costs. The economic and employment benefits from transitioning to a green economy are evident all around the world. There is mounting evidence that nations all around the world are capable of getting their electricity from renewables and Canada is no exception.\nAll around the world we have seen commitments to go 100 percent renewable. This includes Denmark, the Japanese province of Fukushima, and Hawaii to name but a few. The G-7 Summit in Germany in June 2015 Britain, Germany, France, Italy and the US were all willing to sign onto a call for decarbonization by 2050. Although Canada and Japan said no, the all agreed to a phase-out by the end of the century instead.\nThe ruling Conservatives have worked hard to embolden Canada's place as a dirty energy superpower. They have argued that this serves the best interests of Canadians, however, there is a tidal wave of evidence that questions their rationale.\nOn its own the climate crisis imperils everyone's future. We know that fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change causing emissions. There is a powerful logic to move away from fossil fuels even in the absence of the economic, employment and health benefits.\nThe new study suggests that Canadians can get twice as many jobs from transitioning to renewable energy as the do from fossil fuels. The research, published by The Practical Utopian in a report titled Almost Twice as Many: Green Jobs in Canada in the Transition to 100% Renewable Energy, shows that if Canada was to undertake a planned twenty-five year transition to renewable energy it would generate almost twice as many new green jobs as the number of fossil fuel jobs that would disappear. By the end of the transition there would be as many new permanent green jobs as there are jobs in fossil fuels today.\nIn an economy with 19 million jobs, fossil fuels support 550,000 direct and indirect jobs, the wages from which support 245,000 induced jobs, for an approximate total of 800,000 jobs. Only 4 percent of Canada's workers depend on fossil fuels for their income the remaining 96 percent work in other fields.\nTransitioning to 100 percent renewables would have economy wide implications with the majority of new jobs coming from the electricity, buildings, transportation and farming sectors.\nThe expansion of wind, solar, geothermal and other forms of renewable energy would support 127,000 direct and indirect jobs and 90,000 induced jobs. Energy efficiency retrofits to Canadian building and the phasing our of fossil fuels in favor of heat pumps or district energy would support an additional 93,000 direct and indirect jobs and 31,000 induced jobs.\nImproving the infrastructure for biking would create 5,000 new jobs a year, mainly in cycle tourism, rising to 125,000 jobs by the end of the transition. Expanding LRT would generate in 37,000 jobs a year from the capital expenditure and 18,500 jobs operations and maintenance jobs at the start, rising to 462,500 jobs by the end of the transition. Electrifying Canada's railways and phasing out diesel over the next quarter century would generate 14,000 direct and indirect jobs a year, plus 6,000 induced jobs.\nIn agriculture, eliminating the use of natural gas for fertilizer and switching to organic farming would generate 4,000 new permanent jobs a year, rising to 100,000 jobs by the end of the transition.\nWhen all these jobs are added up there will be more jobs provided by transitioning to renewables than are supplied by the fossil fuel industry. All tolled there would be 876,000 new permanent green jobs, compared to the 850,000 jobs in fossil fuels.\nThe detailed 48-page report has been researched and written by the BC author and ecofuturist Guy Dauncey, with support from the BC Sustainable Energy Association, and is backed by over 100 referenced sources.\nFor media enquiries, call Guy Dauncey at 250-924-1445\nTo read and download the full report, click here.\ncarol pickup said...\nGreat report Guy-you are right on the money!! A clean, sustainable environment is critical to the health of the planet and ourselves. We must invest and support clean alternatives to oil, gas and coal!! Cheers and all the best to you. Carol Pickup\nRon Tolmie said...\nCanada's hydro dams are already capable of supplying 100% of our needs for electricity for decades to come provided we use storage of electricity and heat to improve their productivity. Such stores are inexpensive to build"}

{"text":"My research interests as a psychologist, and as part of the Heidelberg Marsilius project \"Global Governance of Climate Engineering\", cover all aspects of individual behavior in response to Climate Engineering technologies, and possible consequences. I am particularly interested in the aspect of risk and uncertainty (risk perception, risky decisions) as an important feature of complex problems. Therefore, I have been working on the risk acceptance of Climate Engineering, as well as on the question of how to deal with the complexity in this context.\nI want to analyze the argument structures of both discourses with a focus on the associated metaphors and analogies. A comparison of risk structures of both discourses is also intended, which provides an opportunity to further elaborate the results of the CEIBRAL project.\nThe Blazing Sword of God. Medieval Perceptions and Reactions to Volcanic Induced Climatic Changes in the Empire North of the Alps.\nIce core data can reveal periods of strong historical volcanic eruptions. These eruptions had climatic impact of global dimension. How did society perceive such climatic transformations? Which explanations did people have and how did they react to these changes? Causing immense damage contemporary events like typhoons or hurricanes are often described as \"apocalyptic conditions\". Can medieval tradition be the basis for such a vocabulary? Close connection to the SPP 1989 could provide interesting data by comparing historical and present approaches of Climate Engineering.\nLack of experience with large-scale transformations of complex human-environment systems constitutes a major challenge for conventional approaches of risk management and climate ethics. Therefore, my research interest is the development of an alternative decision theory. Its methodological basis is formed by embedding arguments of philosophy of science and environmental ethics in historical concepts of risk, nature and technology.\nyoung researchers from many different fields. During this time, I began my research on the intergenerational and strategic challenges of Climate Engineering technologies and got to know many people and ideas that currently come together in the SPP \"Climate Engineering: Risks, Challenges, Opportunities?\".\nDaniel Heyen, Dipl.-Math. \/\/ Heidelberg University \/ Dept. of Economics \/\/ Supervisor: Prof. Timo Goeschl, Ph.D.\nMy current research focuses on the public perception of solar radiation management, afforestation and carbon capture and storage sub-seabed.\nI research the public perception of Climate Engineering especially Solar Radiation Management. The focus is on understanding the impact of personal attitudes, values, and emotions on people's reactions when they are told about Climate Engineering, its benefits and its risks. The work is part of the project ACCEPT, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research.\nThe dissertation examines the relationship between two topic areas of the current international environmental policy, which have not yet been connected, namely the debate on the just distribution of CO2 mitigation measures in the context of the Kyoto Protocol and the discussion about big scale technical interference in the earth's radiation budget (CE). The study investigates the justifications used today for the participation (or non-participation) in the Kyoto mitigation process and how these justifications will or can be used in the future to legitimate additional CE measures, especially Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). The analysis is based on discourse analytical approaches as well as theories on global justice and so combines two approaches of current German CE research with studies on the formation of the mitigation regime. Firstly, the scientific research on physical limits and incompatible side effects of particular CE measures will be complemented by an analysis of the sociopolitical limits within the highest emitters (USA, China, India). Secondly, the assumptions of the prevalent economic studies will be scrutinized, which allot equal and homogenous preferences as regards CO2 emission reductions or CE measures to societies with different historical experiences and political systems.\nFirst, the study will examine similarities and differences of the legitimation of the previous emission reduction policy in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. The analysis will be based on Hajer's (2010) discourse theoretical approach and a quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Central to the justification of current emission reduction policies are arguments on participatory, distributive, and recognition-oriented justice, particularly the question of a historical carbon offset. As a second step, the analysis will compare the states' positions on the integration of CDR measures into the existing Kyoto Regime respectively the establishment of new international agreements. Subsequently, the study will discuss the implications of \"sociopolitical limits\" of the three emission reduction policies for the drafting of a post Kyoto Regime, which, apart from mitigation, would consist of further CDR measures and would reflect the results for shaping CE research in environmental economics.\nTwo questions contour my PhD project: first, how can computer simulations be described as epistemological and technological conditions of the Anthropocene? And second: what future policies are obtained from their use as scenario techniques? In this context, I am interested in the role of geoengineering within geopolitical and economical environmental reaction portfolios in response to climate change."}
{"text":"The One World Trust's ongoing work on climate change centres around the Talanoa dialogue, which is the facilitative process being applied as part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.\nWith the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the close to universal ratification of that agreement by countries in record time \u2013 the world has a good foundation for a strong multilaterally based strategy to address climate change. Crucial for this strategy to work is that the commitment towards implementation remains strong and indeed increases over time. The One World Trust therefore initiated a research project in 2018 in partnership with Wageningen University and GLOBE to analyse how the 'ambition mechanism' of the Paris Agreement can work.\nThe core idea of the ambition mechanism is that every country shall reflect on the outcome of a global assessment of progress towards the agreement's objectives every five years and use this as input to enhance their level of ambition if the assessment (referred to as the 'global stocktake') shows this is necessary.\nThe first output of this project is the policy brief that OWT brings to COP24 in Katowice in December 2018 looking at how countries are preparing to enable the ambition mechanism. The brief also suggests measures both at national and international level that are key to making the ambition mechanism work. This brief can be read here or downloaded as a PDF below.\nThe second output of the project is a story capturing key findings that is shared by project leader and OWT Board of Trustee member Sylvia Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen in the roundtable with Ministers on 11 December at COP24 as part of the final phase of the Talanoa Dialogue, which will be posted here after the event.\nIn 2002, the One World Trust organised a Wilton Park meeting, leading to the Chanctonbury Initiative and subsequently the formation of the Action for a Global Climate Community (AGCC). This bold initiative sought to establish a global climate community, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that would commit to ambitious targets and a progressive approach to addressing climate change. Written evidence was provided to the UK parliamentary Select Committee on Environment to explain the project.\nIn May 2008 the AGCC, together with partners including the European Environment Agency, organised a seminar to discuss cooperation between Europe and India on climate change and sustainable development. The Potsdam Seminar brought together 71 distinguished Indians and Europeans representing the highest levels of government, and explored issues of equity, emissions trading, financing development and institutional arrangements.

{"text":"IfM Home > Insights > Sustainability > Resource efficiency: Can sustainability and improved profit go hand-in-hand?\nResource efficiency: Can sustainability and improved profit go hand-in-hand?\nMoving towards improved sustainability might seem daunting for manufacturers. What should be prioritised, will it be a distraction and sink resources, and is any of it affordable? But what if you had a clear business case to show that improved sustainability would also help your bottom line? And what if that could be achieved with today's existing technologies and know-how, rather than waiting for a silver-bullet solution to be invented?\nProfessor Steve Evans, Director of Research at the IfM's Centre for Industrial Sustainability, shares his insights into how resource efficiency can be good news for your profit margins as well as the environment.\nDid you know that only 50% of edible food we produce is actually eaten? Or that only 10% of processed material reaches the customer? Just think about that: an eye-watering 90% of the resources we process to create goods are not reaching the person for whom they are made. [i]\nThere are examples of inefficiency and waste all around us. For example, in the UK (a tiny island with a comparatively excellent motorway system) trucks on average carry only 27% load factor \u2013 so 73% of truck haulage capacity is not being used.\nFactories are responsible for an estimated 36% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, and often the carbon footprint of manufacturing operations is closely related to how efficiently they operate.\nIt's clear that we need to be working towards reducing such inefficiencies. But is it realistic to think we can take significant steps towards addressing these issues without sinking bank-breaking costs in the process?\nImproving efficiency without reinventing the wheel\nRather than waiting for new revolutionary technological solutions, what can we do with the knowledge and capabilities already at our disposal? This is one of the main questions we need to ask about industrial sustainability, and an issue I regularly discuss with industry leaders and policymakers, because the solutions are often more about organisational strategy, culture and behaviour than about technical capabilities.\nMany of the answers may surprise you. When analysing efficient use of resources, we're talking about how we use energy, water and materials, and how we minimise waste and pollution. Economic principles would suggest that businesses will seek and find the most efficient ways to operate in order to drive down costs - and resource efficiency is imperative for this. And yet, the evidence shows that most companies are not using resources efficiently, and often are in fact unaware of where their inefficiencies exist, even if there are immediate actions that could be taken that do not rely on heavy investment.\nWhy is this worth doing? Take the example of Toyota In the UK, Toyota has been reducing the energy it uses to manufacture a car by at least 8% every year for 14 years, resulting in over 70% reduction over the period. The company can now make four cars for the energy it used to take to manufacture one car 14 years ago. Crucially, Toyota has done this by identifying improvements to energy usage, not by depending on a major new technology to revolutionise the business.\nIf manufacturers moved just half way from their current resource usage towards the usage of the most efficient companies in their own industry, our research indicates that the impact in manufacturing would be 12% increased profit, 15% more jobs and 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nAn example from the cement industry\nThe cement industry is the second most intense industrial producer of CO2, responsible for around 5% of global emissions. If it were a country it would rank as the third highest producer of emissions after China and the US. It is an industry of low margins and high capital, resulting in many plants being decades old and inefficient.\nResearch by my colleague Dr Daniel Summerbell from the Centre for Industrial Sustainability has investigated the scope within existing plants to improve their efficiency through changes which do not rely on capital investment, through analysis of performance variations.\nThe research looked at three cement plants in the UK, using plant data and computer modelling to understand the impact of fuel mix on performance, particularly the fuel-derived CO2 emissions.\nThe increasing use of alternative fuels has been a defining trend in the cement industry over recent decades, which has had clear benefits for plants, primarily in reduced fuel costs as well as reduced carbon footprint. However, because of the diversity of materials being used as alternative fuels, the exact relationship between thermal substitution rate (TSR) and environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions is not always clear. Accordingly, research by our team at the University of Cambridge with Hanson Cement has sought to investigate the uses and the limitations of TSR as a metric. The research has found that improving fuel mix, by the use of a newly-developed metric, could reduce fuel-derived CO2 emissions by 10% or more. While such improvement is subject to availability of appropriate fuel and operating conditions, the low capital requirement makes"}
{"text":" it very attractive to industry.\nThe chart shows the variation of fuel-derived CO2 emissions in a cement factory, produced to make a day's worth of cement. The research compared the median performance of the plants with their 90th percentile best-observed performance. This gap was found to be large: essentially, there can be a huge difference in emissions between the best day (around 190kg emissions) and the worst day (around 340kg emissions). It indicates that standardising performance could reduce fuel consumption by ~6% and fuel-derived CO2 emissions by as much as 16%, all while operating within the existing capability of the plant.\nAs Daniel explained:\n\"Through uncovering this enormous variation, we were able to work with the plant to analyse where the variation was happening, and model the operations in detail to identify the causes. We found that the most significant variables were fuel mix and excess airflow, both of which could be adjusted using existing systems in the plant to improve efficiency. We estimate that at projected prices for 2030, the saving could be worth 1.7m euros per year in carbon prices alone for a single plant.\"\nHow do we get there? Three strategies\nSo how can companies and their supply chains work towards improved resource efficiency?\nAt the Centre for Industrial Sustainability we are working on a number of ways to help manufacturers use resources more efficiently. We identify three key strategies as follows:\n1. Understanding value opportunities\nWe need to start by pinpointing places where resources are wasted, and where opportunities are missed for creating value. As demonstrated in the examples from Toyota and from the cement industry, better use of resources is frequently a source of improved profit margins.\nWe have developed the Cambridge Value Mapping Tool to help companies recognise where value is being captured, and where it is not (which we refer to 'uncaptured' through missed, destroyed, surplus or absent value), using a structured and visual approach. We use this to analyse exchange of value through the lens of each stakeholder in the business network, with the natural environment and society each being given its own voice.\n2. Scalability\nBeyond identifying where resources are squandered or where value is not captured for an individual company, we also need to understand how to scale the findings across industry.\nFor industrial sustainability to be more widely achieved, it is essential that we don't just work in siloes where one company works out a clever trick and then says 'job done'. We need to understand how to scale these solutions.\nThere's an imperative to find solutions that work at scale and increasingly at speed. If we are to hit the targets set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and the Paris Agreement, we need to work towards significant change at the rate of 6% or above improvement per annum of energy, water and material efficiency as well as reducing waste.\nScalability is also about cooperation across industry. Change can be achieved more effectively if organisations collaborate and learn from each other to achieve overarching goals that are in both the individual and the collective interest, by understanding how other companies are making efficiency improvements. This can be supported by engagement from policymakers.\n3. Deploying simple tools\nTo make efficiency improvements more achievable for manufacturers, scalable, practical and easy-to-use tools are required. Resource usage needs to be more visible, then ways to address it made straightforward and measurable.\nWe've been collaborating with Manufacture 2030, an organisation which provides a cloud-based platform called M2030 Bee which helps manufacturers use less energy, water and materials, and thereby cut operational costs and environmental impact. This type of approach, well researched and carefully implemented, will make a valuable difference.\nWe have developed other tools and methods in the Centre for Industrial Sustainability that further support resource efficiency. These include our Zero Loss Yield Analysis (ZLYA), helping manufacturers measure their actual yield from raw materials compared to their expected yield. The results from YLYA are often enormously illuminating \u2013 a recent manufacturer we worked with discovered that their actual waste was 14 times greater than expected and was able to take steps to reduce it.\nContinued efforts to help manufacturers to use resources as efficiently as possible can certainly result both in reduced carbon footprint and in substantial financial benefits.\nIf you would like to find out more about deploying tools and techniques in your own manufacturing operations, or attend a CIS workshop, contact Ian Bamford at imb31@cam.ac.uk.\nCentre for Industrial Sustainability - The Centre for Industrial Sustainability (CIS) works to develop knowledge and tools that accelerate the transition towards a sustainable industrial system.\nIfM Sustainability Association \u2013 The Sustainability Association is a membership network of manufacturing leaders and world-leading researchers looking to drive sustainable change to new levels in manufacturing organisations.\n[i] See www.nextmanufacturingrevolution.org for more background on figures quoted in this article.\nIan Bamford\nE: imb31@cam.ac.uk"}

But even in the case of electric vehicles, there are several'significant' challenges to face. For example- Lithium, the most important element inside an electric vehicle battery is not that easy to buy. And just for information, India does not have any significant reserves of Lithium, which has been found to date.\nBut why bother so much with this geography, geology, etc. Let us look at some important points for those who are willing to switch to electric vehicles, and want to know the 'pros and cons of buying electric Vehicles in India'.\nPros of Buying Electric Vehicles in India\nSubsidy and other Financial Advantages\nElectric Vehicles are no longer 'penny' in horsepower\nHelping make India Environmentally Clean\nCons of Buying an Electric Vehicle in India\nLess Charging Stations Point\nIs Electricity as a fuel, Really Clean?\nWhen the government itself is emphasizing encouraging people to switch to electric vehicles, comes a lot of benefits.\nOne of such benefits is subsidies, with the government placing several lucrative monetary benefits behind electric vehicles, making it difficult to reject an electric car over a car with an internal combustion engine.\nRead More: EV Policies and Subsidies of 13 States of India\nLet us take an example of the Gujarat government. Recently, the Gujarat government has announced a subsidy of up to Rs 1.4 lakh for four-wheelers, while they have made the registration of electric vehicles at any Gujarat RTO absolutely free.\nLong gone are the days when electric vehicles were considered quite low in engine power. Previously, they were known to be so small, that some electric scooters did not even require a license to operate them.\nToday, electric cars come in the form of SUVs and even supercars, which not only look'swanky' but are also heavy in terms of horsepower.\nFor example, Tata Motors' electric SUV 'Nexon EV' has a maximum power of 127 hp, while Mahindra Bolero gives a maximum power output of not more than 75 hp.\nBy opting for an electric vehicle, you can somehow help make your country a place with less environmental degradation.\nIt's no secret that petroleum-fueled cars produce toxic gases throughout their lives. And since electric cars use electricity, instead of oil-based fuels, you may be able to stand in traffic without generating a cloud of harmful compounds.\nAfter all, our next generation should get a chance to see a life without soot clouds everywhere.\nSo, now what are the disadvantages that can deter you from buying an electric car, let's find out- Cons of buying an electric Vehicle in India\nThis is probably the biggest concern of a buyer before buying an electric car. Since each vehicle needs to be recharged at certain intervals, and not being able to find a stop to recharge, the vehicle can become almost redundant.\nAs of March 2021, India has about 1800 charging stations across the country. Whereas till 2017, the number of petrol pumps in the country was more than 60,700.\nEV charging stations are 10 times less available in the country's infrastructure as compared to petrol pumps.\nThough an electric vehicle provides better mileage on a single full refueling than any conventional vehicle, still, non-availability of adequate charging infrastructure is one of the things to be considered before buying an electric vehicle.\nIf you are looking to switch to an electric vehicle due to environmental concerns, you should consider the fact 'where does the electricity that is filling your car come from?'.\nIf electricity was generated by the burning of ordinary coal or petroleum fuel, it is not as clean as you might think.\nSo, what's the solution?\nRead Here: Charging an EV using Renewable Energy- Solar & Wind\nSo to pump up a little optimism, let's try to look at the future of electricity generation in India. Today, the country is investing heavily in and promoting the generation of electricity through renewable sources, especially solar energy.\nAlso, charging stations are a lucrative market for energy corporates, so you can see not only enough charging stations in the future, but also a lot of competing companies in the segment to come up with new technologies like battery swapping.\nThe investments and incentives reflect the government's seriousness"}

{"text":"Water removal has become a pillar tenant for good roofing practices. The faster the water is off the roof the better. The old rule of thumb, \"\u2026 it should be off the roof within 48 hours or it is considered ponding water.\" Why when I look at Google Maps satellite, do I see so many building with ponding water? Maybe the drains are plugged? Really? I don't think so.\nThe effects of ponding roof can be a safety issue as well as a serious financial issue. If most roofers are aware of the hazards of ponding water then why are there so many roofs that do not drain well? What are the common causes for poor drainage?\nAfter walking and inspecting millions of square feet of roofing, I have come to the conclusion cost plays a sad, but significant role. I believe roofers feel cost pressure from owners that do not fully understand the ramifications. I will share some examples.\nA roof that has deck deflection issues, retrofitted for cost savings instead of torn off and the deflection was not addressed properly.\nAnother one I hear is that Polyiso tapered insulation is to expensive and I can go with a 1\/8\" pitch, that should work.\nWeep holes, I can't go above the weep holes, its too expensive to modify or change.\nDisconnect units and other projections for proper height requirements and proper water flow.\nLearn how to move weep holes which can offer the ability to increase insulation heights and have better drainage.\nUse EPS saddle and crickets to make sure water moves around units, projects and even between drains. Saddles can be a roofers best friend.\nI am often asked what is the difference between XPS (extruded polystyrene) and EPS (expanded polystyrene) insulation? Which one is better and why?\nMany myths about rigid insulation have been spread over the years, especially concerning EPS. Some of these EPS myths refer back to an extinct product called bead board. Modern day Engineered EPS is so different and technologically advanced, it's amazing some still get confused. EPS have made major advancements in chemistry, fusion, expansion, steam quality and TQM. Plymouth Foam, the leader in foam, has state-of-the-art proprietary manufacturing technology to make the product even better.\nLab and field research have lead to new conclusions about the two rigid insulations especially in below grade applications. EPS rigid insulation is certainly been found to be superior to XPS in so many ways. The following is just 12 reasons why.\nEPS does not suffer from the same plight as XPS in regards to \"Off Gassing.\" XPS has blowing agents that initially give it a higher R-value, but these gasses escape over time, lowering the R-value.\nEngineered EPS can be made in various densities and can achieve compressive strength up to 8,640 lbs\/ft and flexural strength up to 10,800 lbs\/ft. It is amazing that such a light product, that is 98% air, is so strong.\nEPS insulation is non-hygroscopic and does not readily absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Its closed-cell structure reduces the absorption of moisture into the insulation material yet it can readily expel any absorbed moisture.\nDue to the R-value stability of EPS, Plymouth Foam offers a lifetime limited 100% R-Value Warranty. XPS offers a 90% R-value warranty.\nEPS does not have VOCs or other harmful chemicals in its product. XPS use of chemical HFCs has been deemed to have a high GWP.\nR-value cost per inch is far less in EPS insulation vs XPS Insulation. Value engineering can be used to save $1,000s on projects.\nDue to the manufacturing process, EPS and XPS provide a far different exterior surface. EPS cell structure provides superior bonding.\nPlymouth Foam's EPS is made in Wisconsin and brings jobs, reduces taxes and helps create a better economy for our state. Made in USA.\nEngineered EPS is superior in customizing thickness, lengths, shapes, tapers, chases and can even have reflective laminates attached.\nASTM E84 test method for burning characteristic show that typically EPS has a lower smoke development than XPS.\nEPS, the safe insulation, has a lower Global Warming Potential than XPS. Transportation costs are usually lower also lowering GWP.\nWith over 200 EPS recycling centers in the United States it is easy to see that not only is it 100% recyclable, but it easy to do.\nAs EPS continues to grow even more popular and gain market share, competitors have continued to spread these old myths. The bad news for them is these myths have been BUSTED. Numerous studies done around the world are proving that EPS is not only \"the safe insulation\" but that it holds its R-value better, is extremely durable, great in freeze-thaw"}
{"text":" cycling, has great drying potential and outperforms all other rigid foam insulations.\nEIFS What To Know: Increase your knowledge and lower your risk.\nThe fastest way a construction contractor can increase their risk on a project is to not staying in control of knowledge of a building system - especially high liability systems.\nYou're bidding on a project and EIFS (Exterior Insulated and Finish Systems) is specified in the building package. Who do you rely on that it specified, bid and installed correctly? Where does the buck stop?\nEIFS has make huge advancements in technology, systems and installation details. The biggest advancement for our northern climates has been drainage or moisture management. Advanced design EIFS systems use a drainage cavity to move unwanted moisture out. This concept is monumental and removes many of the old design flaws with EIFS.\nHere is where knowledge can lower your risk and pay off for you. Insist that your EIFS system only uses EPS insulation. Why?\nGood building practices and todays advanced EIFS systems' goals are to discharge any stray moisture as quickly as possible. What about when that moisture finds its way into the insulation? Good Question! We know from studies that XPS (Extruded Polystyrene) insulation has a difficult time discharging moisture. Moisture in EIFS systems can cause serious system failures such as cracking, blistering, peeling paint, structural rotting and even mold. EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) insulation, on the other hand, has the ability to breath and release off moisture much quicker. In test situation, EPS also has the ability to hold most of its R-value, where XPS losses 48%.\nThis is one of those cases where a less expensive product is much better and can lower your risk.\nStopping Condensation in Metal Roof - What's the Secret?\nMetal roofs over the past 10 years have exploded onto the construction sites. The ongoing problems and frustration for building contractors and design professionals of condensation in metal roofs has only increased exponentially. Solving this issue can be very difficult. Let's explore the benefits to rigid insulation and a secret, not known by many, in the building industry.\nCondensation can occurs on a hygroscopic surface, such as wooden sheathing or insulation, then moisture is absorbed, lowering the vapor pressure and increasing the vapor pressure gradient, driving more moisture toward that surface.\nPicking an insulation that is resistant to moisture and help stop condensation is important, but no insulation is 100% waterproof. When Polyisocyanurate (Polyiso\/ISO) or Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) gets wet, they dramatically loss their thermal effectiveness. Engineered Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) has the ability to resist moisture but when it get wet has the ability to expel moisture. Most metal roofing systems are not waterproof but rather watersheds. Therefore, air can travel and flow through the upper metal roof system allowing drying to occur. Learn More Here is the Secret: EPS is the BEST Insulation Solution for Metal Roofs because it can expel moisture caused by condensation. EPS's R-value will stay stable and be an overall better value.\nThe push for higher energy efficiency in commercial buildings is growing, driven in part, by the new energy codes. Another factor has been the Department of Energy studying of R-value in various wall systems and disseminating that information. The study called \"Whole Wall R-value,\" has lead to a better understanding and promotion of Continuous Insulation.\nContinuous Insulation, is defined as, \"insulation that is continuous across all structural members without thermal bridges other than fasteners and service openings.\" More important is the fact that Continuous Insulation increases R-value performance due to the non-interruption of wooden or steel studs.\n\"Furring out\" a wall with studs or furring strips and then filling in the gaps with insulation is still a common method used on interior and exterior walls. Every stud used, lowers the R-value and thermal loss and\/or thermal bridging occurs at this intersections. Advancement in understanding performance R-value through continuous insulation has lead to the importance of Gold-Wall. The advantage of Gold-Wall is not only a Continuous Insulation system, but it has the built in ability to allow for finishing attachments. These finishing attachments can be interior drywall or exterior clad siding like vinyl or steel. The possibilities are almost endless.\nGold-Wall, with its built in surface attachment stud, can be installed easily to most type of masonry walls. Gold-Wall can also be attached to steel studs, wood framing or even OSB\/Plywood surfaces. Gold-Wall comes with a high performance poly facer laminated to the moisture resistant EPS foam board which increases durability, fastener holding and impact resistance.\nThe Secret Moisture Control Leak - a dynamic new strategy.\nThe majority of recent technical discussions in building construction have"}
{"text":" been around Moisture Management. Many articles have been written on drainage plains, building enveloping and vapor retarders. The goal for moisture management is to keep a building lasting longer and performing properly. One area of moisture control or moisture management that has been neglected is foundation insulation.\nFoundation insulation may be easy to overlook as many building professionals may be going under to old adage, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The serious reality is that in cold weather climates any structure that has a foundation that touch soil such as basements or frost walls needs to viewed differently in regards to moisture management.\nFoundation insulation can be used for a variety of reason but the most important is R-Value. This is where it gets interesting - what does Moisture Management have to do with R-Value? Its all about building performance in real world applications.\nWe can explore permeability and the Laws of Thermodynamics and go very technical but for now most people know that when insulation gets wet, the R-Value of the insulation is reduced. This lowering of R-Value is a performance issue.\nSo now that we know what happens to insulation below grade how does that all tie back into Moisture Management? If you are not going to 100% envelope or water proof your below grade insulation or below grade wall system, EPS insulation should be used 100% of the time. Remember, the goal of Moisture Management - keeping a building lasting longer and performing properly - Its all about performance. If you want your below grade insulation performing properly and its going to be left \"unenveloped,\" the best Moisture Management choice is EPS.\nWhat Insulation is the Best in Roofing?\nI get asked this question all the time, but the answer is much more complicated. Its fun to go back historically and look at why insulation was introduced into roofs in the first place. It was fairly simple back then, the waterproofing was to keep water out and the insulation was to keep people warm. Today, insulation is so much more and that is why to answer which insulation is the best, we need to look at the most important attributes of the two most popular roofing insulations - Polyisocyanurate and Expanded Polystyrene.\nR-value is more than the R-value per inch. Polyisocyanurate (ISO), starts out with a higher r-value per inch, but then the blowing agents escapes and the R-value is reduced. (learn more) Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) has a lower R-value per inch but can be make thicker to match any R-value requirement. EPS's R-value increase in colder temperature while ISO decreases. Many would give ISO the edge because of R\/inch, but taking into consideration overpaying for R-value that does not stay stable in lower temperature, the advantage has to good to EPS.\nRoof design can be looked at in numerous ways such as thickness restrictions and tapered possibilities. ISO is very limited in thickness per board. High R-value systems make ISO more labor intensive as it need so many layer to comply. One EPS board can go up to 200 R. ISO is limited in tapered slope possibilities usually 3. EPS on the other hand is almost unlimited. EPS can use insulation shapes (example rounded) that ISO just can't match. Design flexibility goes to EPS.\nExpanded Polystyrene, when compared to polyisocyanurate, certainly has more reason to be use in roofing. It seems over the last few years, many designer have lost sight of the purpose of insulation and the importance of R-value long-term. Some designer only considered combustibility and its superior importance, when in all likely hood this physical property will never ever be used. A feature such as long-term R-value, which performs daily in that system, or even moisture expelling capability, get lower considerations. When all of the major features of insulation are considered, EPS seems to be the clear winner.\nBreaking away from the norm and thinking out side the box is what Lumber Sales & Products, Jackson, Wisconsin strived to accomplish. Using a wood stove and in-floor heating is beyond normal construction and took special design and engineering.\nInstead of using the traditional pink or blue XPS insulation, Engineered EPS was used as the insulation beneath the concrete to dramatically help save energy. Not only does the EPS work better, but the cost savings was almost 30%. The cost savings for just the insulation was over $15,000. In addition, the saving on the supply lines, using EPS, was $7 per linear foot.\nDo Roof Warranties Insulate You?\nBuilding owners are constantly making decisions and risk assessment in regard to their facility. Roofing plays a huge role as it can impact so many factors.\nWhen installing a new roof, (new construction or replacement) an owner is faced with the role of Risk Management. Many building owners believe the serviceable life of"}
{"text":" a roof is directly related to the warranty. Roofing Manufacturers' have seized upon these beliefs by selling \"NDL (No Dollar Limit) Warranties\" giving customers the euphoria of total protection. Are NDL Warranties worth it?\nNDL warranties have a relatively high cost, at several levels. There is a cost per foot for the warranty and to qualify for the NDL, the \"system\" has to contain \"everything\" from the roofing manufacturer (screw, plates, insulation, etc.). Most roofing manufacturers do not make all the components in a roof system but rather put their name on them and mark them up.\nAccording to Roof Warranty Research, roofs typically don't fail because of washers or insulation. So if insulation and other components, rarely if ever, cause roof failures, why bundle them into a warranty? Does the NDL warranty guarantee the R-value of the insulation when it declines or gets wet? Would you be surprised if I told you they do not?\nMaybe bundling all these other components in a NDL warranty offers better cost? When the Roofing Manufacturers bundles the other components, it ultimately places a double margin on \"all the other components\" - 1st mark up from original manufacturer and the 2nd mark up from NDL Warranty Roofing Manufacturer. Does this double margin reduce cost or add extra profit for the roofing manufacturer?\nInterest fact, the roof installers lose their competitive ability to \"shop\" all the other roof components, driving the prices higher. So, NDL Warranties really take Value Engineering away from the roofer and the building owner! In reality, it really hampers the free market system in some ways.\nSo are NDL worth it? It has long been said, that roof warranties are written to protect the manufacturer not the owner and that the best warranty is the one that you never have to use. What is a building owner to do? I suggest saving money and take the advice of the roofing experts, make sure the roof is installed properly, do proper maintenance and faithfully monitor the roof through inspections - this is how you get longer serviceable life, not through a NDL warranty.\nWhat is your definition of long-term - 5, 10, 25 years? How should we judge the R-value of insulation long-term? LTTR (Long-Term Thermal Resistance) is a measure to quantify a comparative method of R-value in an attempt at trying to help architects, specifiers, builders, inspectors and owners. This measurement is achieved by the test methods ASTM C1303 or CAN\/ULC-S770. I applaud the effort of developing these testing to quantify thermal performance, however a major adjustment may need to take place or at least the building industry need to understand these measurements - what they are and what they are not.\nEarly this year, the National Roofers Contractors Association, made a recommendation to it's members that Polyisocyanurate Insulation revise \"its design in-service R-value recommendation to 5.0 per inch thickness.\" This declaration was the second time Polyisocyanurate's R-value was downgraded in the last 2 years. For some of us \"Energy Aficionados,\" who understand the principles of insulation off-gassing, determined it was time to re-examine LTTR testing (View Technical LTTR Bulletin).\nLTTR really looks at Long-Term Thermal Performance of insulation as 5 years. Do we expect a building to last only five years? How is 5 years a true quantitative analysis of R-value performance?\nWe do not replace insulation in a building every 5 years, why would we think that is long-term? Most building in the U.S. are built to last 50 years, some 100 years. Long-term R-value should be figured at 50 years\u2026 right? We know off-gassing continues to happen after 5 years. Let's re-evaluate what we are doing as an industry and modify Long-Term Thermal Resistance to at least 50 years.\nThe real question maybe why? and why another change after last year's change? The answer is independent testing. According to research conducted by BSC (Building Science Corporation) and others, \"the thermal performance of some insulation materials changes as they age. The R-Value of Polyisocyanurate decreases as some of the gasses \u2026 diffuse out and are replaced by air.\" This is known by several names - Thermal Drift, Gas Replacement Process or Off Gassing.\nWhat the research has shown is that unlike EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) Insulation that increases its R-Value when the temperature decreases, ISO Insulation R-Value actually goes down. Bottom line: In the north, when you need the r-value the most, its not there like we thought.\n\u2022\tIf you need to use ISO - the BCS Recommendation is to use it in a \"hybrid insulation approach\" with a cold stable R-Value insulation like EPS"}

One way we do this is by informing healthcare providers who serve such communities. Doctors and nurses work to bring healthy children into the world as well as keep them healthy. Clinicians play an important role in identifying early physical signs of disease and determining what factors may contribute to children's health and development. The more clinicians know about the health risks of environmental contaminants, the more they can educate their patients\u2014particularly pregnant women, parents, and children\u2014about how to lower harmful exposures. Center materials are disseminated to local physician offices, and investigators regularly present Center findings at Grand Rounds presentations, conferences, and other venues.\nOn October 25th 2011, the Center held the first of several planned community briefings. We invited community leaders, elected officials, and policymakers to engage in dialogue about our research findings. The Center Director, Dr. Frederica Perera, discussed health risks associated with prenatal and early exposure to diesel exhaust, pesticides, indoor air allergens, and endocrine disrupting chemicals. WE ACT's Executive Director, Ms. Peggy Shepard, presented on the current state of policy reform regarding exposures that are most common in our urban communities. Over 30 stakeholders engaged in an active discussion on how to effectively translate Center findings that encourages advocacy and prevention. Those who attended the breakfast include representatives from the Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other health and community service organizations in the area.\nIn 2009, the Center hosted the \"Translating Science to Policy: Protecting Children's Environmental Health\" conference in collaboration with WE ACT for Environmental Justice, the Center's lead partner. Over 400 scientists, public officials, community leaders, and advocates for environmental health attended to review 10 years of research findings from the Center and other scientists, discuss interventions stemming from this research, and identify strategies to advance policies to reduce and prevent environmentally-related diseases such as asthma, developmental disorders, and cancer in children living in urban communities. Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Linda S. Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), gave keynote speeches. The focus of the day revolved around air pollution and climate change, residential pesticides, and endocrine disruptors. The conference proceedings are described in the 2009 Translating Science to Policy conference report.\nIn addition to hosting community and stakeholder briefings, the 2009 conference, and workshops for local leaders, the Center investigators regularly present findings at local, national and international grand rounds, conferences, and seminars to build awareness about best practices and innovative findings in environmental health.\nWhat chemical are you most interested in learning about?\nPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons\nMetals (Lead, Mercury)\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health, ccceh.org.

Anderson, Christopher Amrhein Sci Total Environ. 2008 Nov 15;406(1-2):205-18. doi: 10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2008.07.021\nThe Salton Sea is a large shallow saline lake located in southern California that is noted for high sulfate concentrations, substantial algal productivity, and very warm water column temperatures. These conditions are well-suited for sulfide production, and sulfide has been implicated in summer fish kills, although no studies have been conducted to specifically understand hydrogen sulfide production and volatilization there. Despite polymictic mixing patterns and relatively short accumulation periods, the amount of sulfide produced is comparable to meromictic lakes. Sulfide levels in the Salton Sea reached concentrations of 1.2 mmol L(-1) of total free sulfide in the hypolimnion and 5.6 mmol L(-1) in the sediment pore water. Strong winds in late July mixed H2S into the surface water, where it depleted the entire water column of dissolved oxygen and reached a concentration of 0.1 mmol L(-1). Sulfide concentrations exceeded the toxicity threshold of tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and combined with strong anoxia throughout the water column, resulted in a massive fish kill. The mixing of sulfide into the surface waters also increased atmospheric H2S concentrations, reaching 1.0 micromol m(-3). The flux of sulfide from the sediment into the water column was estimated to range from 2-3 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the winter and up to 8 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the summer. Application of the two-layer model for volatilization indicates that up to 19 mmol m(-2) day(-1) volatilized from the surface during the mixing event. We estimate that as much as 3400 Mg year(-1) or approximately 26% of sulfide that diffused into the water column from the deepest sediments may have been volatilized to the atmosphere.\nAFAIK it can happen with fresh-water lakes as well.\nAK | June 11, 2016 at 2:10 pm |\nOccasionally, carbon dioxide (CO2) or other dissolved gases can build up relatively undisturbed in the lower layers of a meromictic lake. When the stratification is disturbed, as could happen from an earthquake, a limnic eruption may result. In 1986, a notable event of this type took place at Lake Nyos in Cameroon, causing nearly 1,800 deaths.\nThe deaths appear to have been from suffocation from CO2, but with sufficient amounts of H2S poisoning can also take place.\nIn the paper, the vegetation, seaweed, increased because the fish that eat it were caged out.

When their advocacy biases their research, or they succomb to the temptation to exaggerate that was explicated by Stephen Schneider, they abandon what is most uniquely valuable to humans about science.\nThe most important science issue has not in fact been resolved: How much difference will it make to the climate for humans to reduce CO2 emissions? In the aggregate, the liabilities in the calculations (incompleteness of knowledge of mechanisms, errors in the estimates of parameters, and approximation errors in the models) swamp the estimated size of effects. Equally important, Will those changes be good or bad on the whole, if they are obtained? In the face of such conflicting evidence as we have (e.g. the combination of increase CO2, warming and rainfall may be net benefits to vegetation growth, including agriculture), and ignorance (energy flows through the parts of the system, including the terrestrial surface where almost everything lives), the highest civic responsibility of scientists ought to be to become humble.\nOutstanding Mathew\nJim D | June 11, 2016 at 12:41 pm |\nStep 1 is to figure out the BAU scenario. Even conservative estimates say 700 ppm of CO2 by 2100, given population growth and development leading to per capita CO2 emission growth. Then the question becomes what does 700 ppm do to our climate? Many would point to the last time it was like that which is prior to Antarctic glaciation in the Eocene when the earth was an iceless hothouse with 200 feet higher sea levels over 40 million years ago. That would not happen by 2100, but that would be the direction headed, even as the levels continue to rise beyond 700 ppm under BAU. It is just a matter of thinking where we are headed with no policy.

Warning: off-topic ramble coming.\nhttp:\/\/www-eaps.mit.edu\/faculty\/lindzen\/171nocephf.pdf\nCheck out the last paragraph (cannot copy&paste from PDF). It explains why every paleo estimate of sensitivity is hopeless: even if you knew the temperatures, which you don't really but even if you did, you'd have no idea what caused them. Lindzen uses the example of equator-to-pole heat transport but there are many more things that can cause climate to change, and we mostly know nothing about how they affected climate in the past.\nWe have records of methane and CO2, but we don't have records of cloud albedo, ozone, water vapor, vegetation\u2026 someone might quibble that we do have some records of vegetation and dust for example, but unlike CH4 and CO2 you cannot assume these dust or vegetation 'levels' applied globally.\n(Hell, until recently the greening trend of the last half-century was in dispute, even though we can look at the world's plants and trees with seven billion pairs of eyes plus a few billion cameras, including some mounted on satellites. To assume we can now estimate greening or browning trends from twenty thousand years ago is preposterous.)\nAnd we have estimates of how much area was covered in ice, but we have no idea how much dust that ice was covered with, or if the radiative forcing one could expect from the ice was really 'apples to apples' (i.e. of the same efficacy) as that of CO2. Now we know that as sea ice recedes the Arctic gets cloudier so the overall effect is about 1\/3 of what you would expect simply looking at the decline in ice; we have no idea if the same thing would happen upon the disappearance of an ice sheet because we have never observed such a thing. Until recently we thought Greenland was reflecting less sunlight because it was getting dustier; it then turned out that, rather, the satellites' sensors were getting degraded.\nWe still have little idea how aerosols affect climate\u2026 yet some guys are trying to model the aerosols of the past. And they're not even the same kind (today the main agent is sulphuric acid, before dust).\n(It's funny that the 'forcing efficacy' issue has been raised about instrumental studies, and not about paleo papers that would be devastated if efficacy really changed much between forcing agents. For example, only about 20% of the forcing in LGM reconstructions is CO2).\nYou cannot"}
{"text":" simply assume that whatever change in GHG concentration (or other 'forcings') took place at the time of these temperature changes was responsible for said changes. In fact, by excluding other factors (which you know nothing about) you will systematically overestimate sensitivity. That's why paleo sensitivity disagrees with both energy budget and inter-annual (ERBE\/CERES) estimates. It also explains in part why the range of sensitivity in paleo is so wide.\nAdmittedly this is also a strike against sensitivity estimates using the instrumental record, but less so \u2013 because we have observations that allow us to rule out a good many 'natural' causes of climate change. We know that in the last 150 years the AMOC hasn't shut down and there hasn't been a massive change in equator-to-pole heat transfer. We know that since 1980 the amount of cloud cover has remained more or less the same, within a 5% band; the warming trend since then would be very difficult to explain from changes in cloud cover alone. And so on.\nWhenever one mentions natural climate change the response from a certain side is something like 'the ocean cannot create heat' or 'the clouds cannot change by themselves'. While technically true these statements are meaningless and reveal at best ignorance and at worst deception. All climate changes will involve a radiative change at some point, but said radiative change (forcing, feedback, whatever you call it) does NOT have to originate from a radiative source. It can all start with a change in air currents, or ocean currents, or tree cover, or sea ice, or methane emissions from bacteria, or\u2026\nAsking 'yeah but what caused the clouds to change?' is like asking why are there planets.\nThe best example of non-radiative climate change is in fact Milankovitch cycles, which affect not the amount but the distribution of sunlight (well eccentricity changes the amount of sunlight, but precession and tilt don't). Technically speaking, the forcing is zero; paleo estimates consider GHGs, ice sheets and vegetation\/dust forcings but if one is strict they should be considered feedbacks. Sensitivity, calculated the way it's done for observational estimates, would be infinite.\nYou can also see how simply switching one of these radiative 'things' from forcing to feedback, or viceversa, can allow a researcher to arrive at a radically different sensitivity number. It's all meaningless.\nThe one advantage of the paleo method is that since there is enough time for the ocean to reach equilibrium you avoid that source of uncertainty. But that also means you cannot use it to estimate TCR.\nAnyway, as time goes on the estimates of aerosol forcing and heat uptake will get better and better. The instrumental studies will arrive at a number, if not for what sensitivity 'is', at least for what it has been for the last 150 years. The paleos will never arrive at anything.\n[\u2026 E]ven if you knew the temperatures, which you don't really but even if you did, you'd have no idea what caused them.\nThere's considerable use of oxygen isotopes as global temperature proxies, although refinement is still going on.\nAZC, very nice comment. I read a number of paleo sensitivity studies and commented on them in the climate chapter of AoT. But had not come across your trenchant criticism before. Whatever the paleosensitivity might be, it cannot be to anthropogenic forcings. So meaningless in the context of AGW sensitivity.\nA great soundbite comment taking a large junk of the paleo confirms models argument right off the table.\nThanks. I just realized another problem with paleo: survivorship bias. By definition, we can only analyze the temperature changes that happened; to be more precise, those that left a big enough imprint (disappeared glaciers and so on).\nWe have no idea if other forcings took place but did NOT result in similar temperature changes. So we'll never know about the times when sensitivity was low. Something like this is mentioned in Roy Spencer's blog; it's hard enough to know exactly what we're measuring with CERES but pretending to estimate sensitivity with a bunch of ice cores is absurd.\nhttp:\/\/www.drroyspencer.com\/2016\/06\/another-potential-reason-why-climate-sensitivity-is-over-estimated\nWillis Eschenbach | June 11, 2016 at 5:04 pm |\nDavid Appell (@davidappell) | June 10, 2016 at 11:57 pm\nThanks, David.

Around the time of Homo habilis a number of transformation began to take place: larger brain, tool use, and probable diet change.\nSee Wrangahm's Catching Fire\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Catching-Fire-Cooking-Made-Human\/dp\/0465020410\nThere is a another climate mystery relating to human evolution which I have not seen much about.\nIt is hard to imagine civilization arising without the positive effects of climate in our current interglacial. I suppose this could be coincidence but certainly the development of agriculture and domestication of livestock allowing large sedentary populations became a significant influence during this interglacial and not before. If climate and the development of agriculture\/civilization are related, here's the mystery.\nAnatomically modern humans evolved at least 200,000 years ago. Why did we not develop agriculture and civilization during the Eemian interglacial?\nWhy did we not develop agriculture and civilization during the Eemian interglacial?\nProbably because \"we\" weren't there. Why do you assume the major thrust of human evolution was anatomical?\nThe Neanderthals had bigger brains (on average) than we do, but a different distribution of cortical area among regions.

It'll be found once the researchers get themselves sorted out over the \"blank slate\" fallacy. And the \"all human brains are identical\" fallacy.\nJames Cross | June 12, 2016 at 11:00 am |\nActually human brain sizes were as large or larger than they are now by the Eemian. Of course, there is no way to know if the internal wiring was different, although that is a possibility.\nI don't know of any contemporary researchers who believe humans are blank slates or that all brains are identical.\nYou might have a point about language if you want to assume modern languages developed after the Eemian. Evidence is for modern language evolving at least as long ago as 70-80,000 years but it is hard to imagine this came out of the blue with no precedent (as apparently Chomsky has suggested).\nThe blank-slate paradigm would appear to be alive and well as of this year. Just an example. I would say the denial of a \"Universal Grammar\" (\"UG) constitutes a vote for \"blank-slate\". Unless some other reconciliation is proposed.\nThe supposition that only certain constructions will emerge in the interaction between that blank slate, the local cultural\/linguistic norms, and the realities of communication (theory) is hardly an argument against \"blank-slate\". Rather, it would seem (to me) to be an argument how the \"blank-slate\" could be adaptive.\nAs for \"all brains are identical\", I suppose I was summarizing (and putting down) the effectively universal notion that every human's language capacity is similar in type if not in quantity.\nFor this, I offer the Pirah\u00e3 controversy: Everett (and many others) took their linguistic differences as evidence against the UG. I don't recall exactly how supporters of UG attempted to reconcile it, but I distinctly recall noticing one option that wasn't on the table: that the Pirah\u00e3 possessed genetic differences that interfered with their ability to use certain types of recursion.\nWhile I'm not saying this is the right explanation, the fact that it was avoided (unless I missed something I was looking pretty hard for) demonstrates the underlying assumption that all humans have qualitatively identical language capacities.\nJames Cross | June 12, 2016 at 1:35 pm |\nThanks for your thoughts.\nBTW I am not dismissing your arguments in any way. In fact, I think there is a good deal of merit to them and, in fact, I have argued much the same way, That is, that there have been major changes in the brain since the Eemian that account for modern behavior.\nhttps:\/\/broadspeculations.com\/2012\/12\/22\/lost-history-revenge-of-the-nerds\/\nSaying if you don't accept UG (which I more or less do), however, I don't think is exactly saying that human beings are blank slates. And certainly human brains, while not identical, are similar enough that any human can learn any language if exposed to it at any early enough age.\nMy argument in the link is that there was some dramatic transformation in humans probably in Southern Africa about 70-90,000 years ago.\nIn part I was wondering for other evidence:\nWas there something different about the Eemian that made it less propitious for civilization?\nIs there even a relationship between civilization and climate? Is it coincidental that civilization arose in the Holocene? Could it had arisen earlier although perhaps not so robustly?\nOr, was there something about the Eemian and its arrival at this particular stage of the evolution of Homo sapiens that may have set the stage for the later changes? In this case, changes see in the archaeological record about 70-90,000 years ago (mainly in Southern Africa) might really be the result of neurological changes that occurred during the Eemian. I am thinking here of particular selection pressures \u2013 for example increases in aridity \u2013 that have selected for particular human traits.\nMy argument in the link relates especially to creation to extended kinship groups and expanded cooperative and reciprocal behavior that would enhance survival during periods of environmental stress.

While he seems to argue for a much earlier origin for language, his theory certainly makes a link between language and kinship,\n@James Cross\u2026\nAnd thanks for yours. An interesting post. Here's one of mine, on a similar subject.\nSaying if you don't accept UG (which I more or less do), however, I don't think is exactly saying that human beings are blank slates.\nWell, UG would represent a genetic (or otherwise non-culturally-transmitted) set of defaults for language development"}
{"text":". Supposing UG not to exist, I don't see how anything but a purely cultural transmission could explain language acquisition. How is that distinguished from \"blank slate\"?\nAnd certainly human brains, while not identical, are similar enough that any human can learn any language if exposed to it at any early enough age.\nMy point is that that's dogma. Both sides in the Pirah\u00e3 controversy built that assumption into their arguments. But, assuming UG, how could the recursion so essential to it be left out of their language?\nOh, there are possible explanations: most researchers consider UG to be about defaults, not compulsions. I suppose a sufficiently compulsive cultural norm could override it.\nBut my point is that genetic differences are a valid potential explanation. The fact that they never came up for discussion demonstrates that their invisibility is a cultural norm imposed on science, not that the notion is invalid (as a hypothesis).\nAnd climate science thinks it has problems with cultural interference.\nSuch as Toba? Couple things I'll point out: a genetic restriction of this sort could as easily happen due to a local sweep and speciation without a massive die-off. Perhaps the sweep involved some neuro-linguistic innovation that made its possessors more adaptive.\nAnother thing to consider is that the sea-level was much lower 7-90,000YA. It's not impossible that the most advanced humans lived in coastal parts of the East-Arabian corridor, parts all deep underwater (and probably under sediment) today.\nMy preferred model is that the innovation occurred in this area, and expanded in all directions, including back into Africa where there was enough back-flow from the previous populations to provide the apparently high genetic diversity there. But I admit it's all very speculative.\nMy argument in the link relates especially to creation to extended kinship groups and expanded cooperative and reciprocal behavior that would enhance survival during periods of environmental stress.\nWell, I find myself more convinced by the corticalization logic: with a brain capable of maintaining a \"well-known\" group of 150 for each individual the capacity for maintaining kinship networks among groups would be far higher than with 50 (e.g. chimpanzees\/bonobos). And language just makes it better.\nTerrence Deacon in the The Symbolic Species points to language arising from the needs of mating and in association with marriage and kinship. While he seems to argue for a much earlier origin for language, his theory certainly makes a link between language and kinship,\nYes, there's much evidence for an early appearance of language of some sort.\nI'd guess there were at least 4 stages in the development of human language after the split with chimpanzees\/bonobos. Also, I'd guess there's a similar relationship between corticalization and vocabulary as between corticalization and group size.\nGreat discussion, AK.\nRegarding UG, I probably have not looked into it enough to judge but I was understanding it to have a particular set of rules and syntax that it was declaring universal. One could posit a more general symbolic capability that could express itself in language among other forms that would be non-blank slate but not UG.\nI really wasn't thinking of Toba, although I am aware of that theory. I am thinking more about the multiple lines of evidence tracing back to South Africa and the time period of 70-90,000 years ago: earliest elaborate artistic complexes, language phoneme analysis, and genetic analysis that I mentioned in my post. Incidentally the San bushmen, like the Piraha, also use clicks and whistles as part of their language. Years ago I don't remember where I read about someone theorizing about whistles and clicks being part of the earliest languages and were used in hunting. They also might be sounds that could be made by humans before the larynx descended which fully occurred (I think) also around this same time period, suggesting a possible major advance in language capability with more expressive capabilities.\nIf we want to argue for full modern language before this capability then we would need to think of humans 150-200,000 years as very much like humans today. That would open up my original question of why didn't they create agriculture and civilization during the Eemian?\nHowever, I certainly don't think language appeared out of the blue 100,000 years ago. I don't know whether you are aware of the theory of an association between tool use and language. The same parts of the brain used in language are also used in making stone tools. A pathway like this could have occurred. Early humans make tools. They learn to make tools by watching other humans make tools. From watching others making and being watched, it is a small step to use the hands that made the tool to make other gestures for communication. If you supplement this with whistles, clicks, and other vocal expressions, you might have an intermediate language. As the larynx began to descend over time, you would be able to have the full expression"}
{"text":" capability of modern language.\nI need to spend more time on your post but what little I got from glancing at it suggests that it wouldn't be contradictory to tool use to sign language as an intermediate step.\n\"My preferred model is that the innovation occurred in this area, and expanded in all directions, including back into Africa where there was enough back-flow from the previous populations to provide the apparently high genetic diversity there. \"\nThere certainly is a lot of evidence of human moving from Africa along the sea shore and also back-flow. Not only out of Africa but back from Asia too. My theory has been more than main innovations originated in South Africa and spread across the continent and after that this other stuff happened but as you say this is all speculative.\nAt any rate, it would be fascinating if there could be mapping done of the best knowledge about human populations and African, Asian, and European climate from the Eemian to the Holocene.\nYes, interesting discussion. Few points:\nWRT the descent of the larynx: my picture had been that it had partly descended by the time our lineage split from the Neanderthals (homo heidelbergensis), and then continued its descent in our lineage while reversing in Neanderthals. (Late Neanderthals certainly don't appear to have had a descended larynx.)\nBut checking out more recent work, science appears to have passed me up, and the descent (in our lineage anyway) appears to be more recent: 150,000 YA ago or less. Indeed, Lieberman (a late larynx descent enthusiast) says:\nSurprisingly, our reconstruction of the 100,000-year-old\nspecimen from Israel, which is anatomically modern in most respects, also would not have been able to accommodate a SVT with a 1:1 ratio, albeit for a different reason. Although it had only a moderately long face, its extremely short neck would have also placed its larynx too low in the chest if its SVT were equally proportioned. Again, like its Neanderthal relatives, this early modern human probably had an SVT with a horizontal dimension longer than its vertical one, translating into an inability to reproduce the full range of today's human speech.\nIt was only in our reconstruction of the most recent fossil specimens\u2014the modern humans postdating 50,000 years\u2014that we identified an anatomy that could have accommodated a fully modern, equally proportioned vocal tract. Interestingly, the date of these specimens coincides with the appearance of the Upper Paleolithic tool kit, which is often associated with a florescence in modern human cognitive capacities.\nThis would roughly synchronize with the \"Cro-Magnon event\", which I would speculate involved the final step in language evolution.\nI have my doubts about tool use. I remember a picture (from a recent paper) showing a young gorilla learning to make tools by watching its mother, and Frans de Waal makes some good arguments about the non-need for language in such learning in The Ape and the Sushi Master. Combine that with the linguistic ability demonstrated by bonobos (which probably predates the split), and I can't see much need for new language abilities to make simple tools.\nIf we suppose several steps in language capacity evolution, we could start with something like the abilities we share with bonobos, and consider them part of the radiation that produced the \"crown\" great apes: Humans, Chimpanzees\/Bonobos, and Gorillas.\nAfter that, perhaps each step is associated with a subsequent radiation: Homo \"habilis\", ergaster\/erectus, heidelbergensis, AMH, and the final step 50-70,000 YA with the \"Cro-Magnon event\" and similar expansions into Austalia and back into Africa.\nIMO this step had more to do with communicating techniques across space and time, rather than the cognitive abilities to use them.\nSome final comments.\nIt isn't that language is required for tool use. The theory is more based on a coevolution of tool use and language.\nhttp:\/\/www.wired.com\/2013\/09\/tools-and-language\/\nLooking more at your genetic difference explanation for the Piraha, I can't really buy into unless there was actually DNA testing showing some significant genetic difference. Frankly I doubt much will be found from surrounding groups at least.. Human populations are well mixed. It is unlikely that the Piraha have been isolated more than a few hundred years max and probably not even that much. That is they probably mix with nearby groups even today. But even if they were isolated for a few hundred years, that wouldn't be enough to create a significant difference in language. I think more likely more analysis will reveal substantial similarities with other cultures and language. In other words, I think Everett probably is exaggerating and\/or misunderstanding some things. BTW Wikipedia says the Brazilian government has opened and they are learning Portuguese.\nPingback"}

In an article on The Guardian, he said even if we reduce emissions immediately, we might be able to delay reaching 450ppm but \"it is still looking like a challenge to stay below 450ppm.\" El Nino has played a significant role in climbing carbon dioxide levels, but it's likely we'll see higher CO2 levels than the last large El Nino storm during 1997 and 1998 because \"manmade emissions\" have risen by 25 percent since that storm, according to The Guardian.

We acknowledge that there is an underlying absurdity to the FRB's request for reconsideration procedure in this instance: because the FRB imposed no waiting period, on November 7, 2002, Citigroup acquired Golden State Bancorp. It is imperative that, as a policy matter, the FRB impose waiting periods. In this case, the approval should be rescinded and other appropriate actions taken on the above-recounted matters.

Johnson, Secretary and Governors\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W.\nRE: REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE BOARD'S OCTOBER 28, 2002, ORDER APPROVING THE APPLICATIONS AND NOTICES OF CITIGROUP INC. TO ACQUIRE GOLDEN STATE BANCORP AND CAL FED BANK AND ITS AFFILIATES\nDear Chairman Greenspan, Governors, Secretary Johnson:\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, and the Fair Finance Watch (collectively hereinbelow, \"ICP\"), this letter is a timely request for reconsideration of the Federal Reserve Board's (the \"FRB's\") October 28, 2002, Order approving the Applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nThe FRB's approval Order evades the most troubling of the issues raised, about predatory practices at CitiFinancial, and the scandals surrounding Citi's investment bank. ICP from its first comment, on June 3, 2002, inquired into the status of the examination of CitiFinancial on which the Fed had conditioned its approval of Citigroup - EAB in mid-2001. Now, fifteen months later, the FRB states that \"[t]he Board is in the midst of conducting its examination of CitiFinancial and CitiFinancial Mortgage.\" Order at 39. This fifteen month delay reflects either (1) the FRB's lack of commitment to rooting out predatory practices at the largest company it regulates or, (2), less plausible, the FR"}
{"text":"B's lack of resources.\nThroughout this proceeding, ICP provided the FRB with documents from inside CitiFinancial, including sales training scripts that instructed employees to ask an applicant how much they could pay per month then offer a package with insurance included, and documentation of scam \"mystery\" shopping (employees were told the dates and topics of the \"tests\") and that employees' bonus are determined by how much insurance they sell. On October 9, 2002, the FRS sent three lawyers to Tennessee to depose several of ICP's sources. But before acting on any of this information, the FRB on October 28 approves Citigroup's application, stating that \"some of the comments require additional investigation\" (id. at 44), and noting that it has expanded its examination to include CitiFinancial's insurance sales practices and \"compensation systems.\"\nCertainly, these matters deserve investigation. But in mid-2001, the FRB conditioned its approval of Citigroup-EAB on just this examination, and stated that it would \"consider the information gathered in its examination... in reviewing future proposals by Citigroup.\" That the exam is still not completed, fifteen months later, means in essence that Citigroup has had a \"bye,\" or \"get out of jail free\" card, for more than a year now.\nIn order to give Citigroup what it wants, the FRB has created a precedent that bodes badly for CRA and communities. In mid-2001, the FRB saw fit to condition its approval of Citigroup-EAB on an examination of Citigroup's subprime lending business. But now in 2002, the FRB tries to entire disconnect predatory lending and merger approvals. It states, for example, that \"[s]ome commenters have taken the opportunity provided by this notice to give the Board information and comments about the subprime lending and insurance sales activities of Citigroup's subprime lending affiliates.\" Order at 39, emphasis added. That has never before been the Federal Reserve's position -- and for a reason: the Fed is required by law to consider applicants' effects on low- and moderate-income communities, and their managerial resources, risk-management and compliance safeguards. The FRB dodged the first bullet in 2001 by approving Citi-EAB but conditioning its approval on an examination. But 15 months later, the exam is not done. It turns out it is in an applicant's interest to be undergoing an examination: it's a free ride as long as the examination continues. And how long will that be? The FRB states that \"the scheduling, conduct and completion of an examination is determined by the availability of resources of the banking agencies and is not related to the timing of acquisition proposals.\" Order at 45. The FRB is implying that it does not have the resources to conduct an examination of CitiFinancial in less than 15 (or more) months. Given the Fed's budget, which is hardly overseen by Congress, the Fed's defense cannot be taken at face value. The Fed states that it is conducting its exam in \"close cooperation\" with the New York State Banking Department. Id. at 39. Perhaps the FRB is blaming its Citigroup-friendly delay on the NYSBD? The NYSBD has been delaying in responding to ICP's Freedom of Information Law request regarding its supervision of Citigroup; the FRB denied ICP access to \"eight linear feet\" of documents about this exam and still owes ICP several long-delayed FOIA request responses.\nThe \"bones\" the FRB throws in the approval order are limited to expanding the never-ending examination of CitiFinancial to including insurance sales practices and compensation systems, and requiring Citigroup to file reports on its subprime lending -- they're most limited to its real estate lending -- for the next two years. As regards Primerica, the FRB passes the buck to the OTS. The Fed states, in footnote 67, that \"commenters also expressed concerns about the sale by a Citigroup affiliate, Primerica Financial Services (and its agents), of loan products of Citicorp Trust (previously called Travelers Bank & Trust, FSB) and insurance products of other affiliates. The Board has consulted with the OTS, the appropriate federal supervisor of Citicorp Trust, and relevant state regulatory agencies and forwarded the comments to those agencies.\" Well, on October 29, 2002, the Office of Thrift Supervision issued an eight-page approval letter. The OTS stated that \"a federal [thrift] charter may be granted only to persons of 'good' character and responsibility... The FRB, in its approval of the related application... did rely on commitments and undertakings by Citigroup, designed in part to address issues raised in various comments... OTS has concluded that is appropriate to condition approval of the federal charter application on Citigroup complying with the commitments made to and conditions imposed by the FRB.\"\nBut as set forth above, the FRB's approval noted that Citigroup's unreformed Primerica"}
{"text":", which sells high-cost products of Citicorp Trust FSB, is regulated by the OTS; the FRB simply forwarded comments about this to the OTS. Now the OTS defers to and relies on the Federal Reserve, without even mentioning much less addressing this issue. Note that CitiFinancial still imposes single premium credit insurance on non-real estate loans and sells bogus \"property insurance\" on supposed collateral like fishing rods and ladders, and that \"bonuses for CitiFinancial sales people are tied to how much credit insurance they sell in conjunction with new loans.\" Fed Expands Citigroup Probe To Insurance-Sale Practices: In Approval of Golden State Purchase, Subprime-Lending Issues Are Detailed, by Rob Wells, Dow Jones, October 29-30, 2002.\nEven the reforms that the FRB calls \"the Enhancements\" won't all go into effect until \"the end of 2003,\" according to the Order. It's a racket: perhaps the FRS exam can be kept going for another fifteen months, and then some other miniscule \"reforms\" announced. That's all the Fed seems to require: ground-cover for approvals.\nThe FRB notes that ICP (and others) have \"alleged that Citigroup underreports delinquencies in its subprime loans portfolio.\" [Note: ICP, with CitiFinancial's own documents, has shown this: employees distort delinquency by flipping loans or advancing the due dates by making small payments, because that's the only way they can get their ROCopoly bonuses]. But the FRB says that it \"will continue to review such data in connection with its supervisory examinations.\" By the logic of this FRB order, everything can be secret, and approvals (at least for Citigroup) are automatic -- in part because the examinations are never completed, even after 15 months.\nThe FRB recites that \"a commenter asserted that, in light of allegations about the subprime lending activities, securities-related activities, and other banking services, the Board should find that Citigroup is not in compliance with the BHC Act's requirements for financial holding companies.\" Then the Board baldly states that \"the requirements... are met in this case.\" PNC was threatened with losing financial holding company status; the range of scandals in which Citigroup is involved is much broader. But we forgot-- the FRB has given Citigroup an ongoing \"get out of jail free\" card.\nRegarding comments that the Citigroup's proposed settlement with the FTC and a \"related\" class action are insufficient, the FRB states that it \"has forwarded these comments to the FTC.\" Well, ICP has a FOIA request in to the FTC that has still not been fully responded to. Citigroup's dominance of its putative regulators, including the FRB, appears to continue.\nICP will now directly address the narrow standard to which the FRB seeks to limit requests for reconsideration: \"relevant facts that, for good cause shown, were not previously presented to the Board.\" 12 C.F.R. \ufffd262.3(k).\nSee, e.g., Dow Jones Business News of October 29, 2002, regarding \"a report this week in the Chinese-language 21st Century Business Herald that Citibank provides domestic clients with credit cards from its Hong Kong and Singapore branches that enable individuals to transfer funds out of China.\"\nSee also, Business Week of November 11, 2002, \"STILL SPINNING THE NUMBERS:\"\nThe SEC also aims to stamp out ''material misstatements or omissions'' in company announcements. But the reform drive hasn't quite quashed the temptation for companies to put the best possible spin on their numbers. Consider Citigroup's third-quarter earnings announcement on Oct. 15. The financial behemoth counted the gain from the sale of its headquarters on New York's Park Avenue for $ 1 billion toward what it calls ''core earnings,'' a measure of ongoing operations. The $ 323 million aftertax profit from the one-time transaction generated half of the 19% growth in Citi's core earnings.\nCitigroup CFO Todd S. Thomson says accounting rules required it to count the gain. It was also fair because the bank's business includes a property investment portfolio. Besides, he says, most of the real estate gain booked was from the 60% of the building it had leased to other companies; gains from space it occupies itself are being taken over 15 years. GAAP discourages exclusions of all but the most extraordinary losses and gains from results. But counting it as part of its ongoing ''core earnings'' won't reassure its investors. ''Including it was a matter of judgment erring on the side of aggression,'' says Lawrence A. Cunningham, professor of law and business at Boston College. ''It is out of step with the climate.''\nThomson says the gain is one of several items. For example, Citi reduced core earnings by $ 215 million for fines it"}
{"text":" paid to settle government charges about practices years ago by Associates First Capital Corp., a consumer-finance company it bought in 2000. However, it doesn't help that Citi omitted a key fact when it compared its results with last year's: It didn't highlight that, because of an accounting rule change, it didn't have to reduce earnings by about $ 100 million a quarter to amortize goodwill this year, as it did last year. The apples-to-oranges comparison made the latest results look 3% better. Thomson dismisses the matter as ''not a huge number for us'' compared with peers.\nLast year, Citi did think it was important. Then, it showed in its handout how much more the company would have earned had the rule change already been in effect. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which ordered the change, also thought it was important to require companies to show its impact in official quarterly reports filed with the SEC a few weeks after earnings announcements. ''This is very disappointing,'' says Charles L. Hill, research director at earnings tracker Thomson First Call. ''They should just put it in the earnings release, too.''\nSee New York Post of November 6, 2002, \"PROBE EXAMINES WHETHER GRUBMAN PUMPED FAILING STOCK:\"\nJack Grubman was in WorldCom's pocket - so says a preliminary report prepared by an independent examiner into the bankrupt telecom's failure. The former high-flying Salomon Smith Barney telecom analyst was found to have \"performed roles inconsistent with that of an independent securiteis analysts,\" said Dick Thornburgh in his preliminary report on WorldCom, orderd by the bankruptcy court. The 122 page report devotes 23 pages to Grubman's part in the WorldCom debacle that resulted in the nation's largest bankruptcy ever.

It is imperative that, as a policy matter, the FRB impose waiting periods. We note and support the California Reinvestment Committee's request for reconsideration [and that of the Woodstock Institute -- see below]. as well.

Here's a joint statement with CRC and Woodstock, for Nov. 13:\nCitigroup Ignores Low- Income People:\nMulti-City Movement Urges Bank to Provide Affordable Accounts to All Consumers\nSan Francisco, Chicago and The Bronx, NY, Nov. 13 -- In an era of plentiful free and low-cost checking accounts, one of the nation's largest banks, Citigroup, takes the spotlight: not for it's affordable accounts but for its ridiculously overpriced products. Citibank lags far behind its competitors in offering basic retail accounts that are affordable to low- and moderate- income customers, and demonstrates that it has little interest in serving, in an other-than-predatory way, communities and individuals who don't directly pad its pockets.\nThree organizations based in New York, San Francisco and Chicago are raising these issues in filings to Federal Reserve Board this week, as part of their request for reconsideration on the Federal Reserve Board's decision on Citigroup's purchase of Golden State Bancorp.\n\"It is egregious that a bank of this size can so flagrantly disregard low- and moderate- income communities by offering such expensive accounts. It is clear that Citi, with its $1 trillion in assets, sees itself as a bank for the wealthy,\" says Arthi Varma, policy advocate at the California Reinvestment Committee (CRC). Marva E. Williams of Woodstock Institute in Chicago agrees, as does Matthew Lee, executive director of Inner City Press \/ Community on the Move and the Fair Finance Watch, who added:\n\"Citigroup's financial offerings are separate and unequal and must be changed Citibank has many fewer branches in the low-income sections of New York City than in Manhattan below 96th Street. There, Citibank has 62 branches, and only four in the lower-income portion of the county, Upper Manhattan. Worse, Citibank has only 15 branches in The Bronx, of which"}
{"text":" only four are in the lower-income half of the county, the South Bronx. Said otherwise, The Bronx has four-fifths of the population of Manhattan, but less than a quarter of the number of Citibank branches. Brooklyn has 60% more population than Manhattan, but less than half as many Citibank branches. As is true nationwide, and around the world, Citigroup's presence in lower-income communities is with its high interest rate lender CitiFinancial. This is why we say: Citigroup's financial offerings are separate and unequal and must be changed,\" Mr. Lee concluded.\nIn California, over 80% of Citibank branches are in middle- and upper- income communities. In Oakland, nearly 70% of the City is low- and moderate- income, yet Citibank has no branches in any low- or moderate- income neighborhood of Oakland. Citi last week consummated its acquisition of Golden State Bancorp, the holding company for California Federal Bank (CalFed). \"We are outraged that Citibank may end CalFed's affordable lifeline banking products after this merger occurs. It is clear that Citibank cares little about servicing the basic needs of low-income communities, and instead caters its products to high-income customers,\" says Kevin Stein, Associate Director of CRC.\n\"The high cost of checking and savings accounts is one of the reasons that lower-income consumers never enter the financial mainstream,\" said Ms. Marva Williams. Although being 'unbanked' may be due to a number of factors, almost a third of unbanked families surveyed by the Federal Reserve Board in 1995 cited cost as a reason for not having a checking account. The problem is pronounced in Chicago. According to a recent report by the Metropolitan Chicago Information Center (MCIC), over 25% of Chicago consumers do not have a checking account and almost 20% do not have a savings account.\nThe three above-named organizations assert that Citibank's checking accounts are expensive and burdensome. Citibank's most basic account in California costs $6.50 per month in California and only allows 6 checks per month. It's next most affordable checking account product, Easy Checking, is expensive and burdensome. The account has a minimum opening deposit of $100, limits the account holder to 10 checks per month and has a monthly fee of $9.50, a fee that is substantially higher than other institutions across the nation. The three organizations affirm that the high cost of accounts contribute to the problem of the unbanked.\n\"The high cost of checking and savings accounts is one of the reasons that lower-income consumers never enter the financial mainstream,\" said Ms. Marva Williams. Although being 'unbanked' may be due to a number of factors, almost a third of unbanked families surveyed by the Federal Reserve Board in 1995 cited cost as a reason for not having a checking account.\nMr. Lee identified several disadvantages is being \"unbanked\": \"Many people in the South Bronx and communities like it do not have convenient access to a bank branch. Therefore they use check cashers who charge exorbitant fees, and they do not build up a track record and credit history that would help them get mortgages, small business loans and other credit products. Citibank participates in this exclusion, and then targets the unbanked with higher-cost loans through CitiFinancial. And so we say, again (and again): Citigroup's financial offerings are separate and unequal and must be changed,\" Mr. Lee concluded.\nInterim update of November 4, 2002: we will be requesting reconsideration of the Federal Reserve's October 28 order approving Citigroup's proposed acquisition of Golden State Bancorp during the permitted timeframe, which runs through November 11. Until then, for or with more information, contact us.\nUpdate of October 28-29, 2002: after six p.m. on October 28, the Federal Reserve announced its approval of Citigroup's application to acquire Golden State Bancorp. The Fed's approval order, sixty pages in length, evades the most troubling of the issues raised, about predatory practices at CitiFinancial, and the scandals surrounding Citi's investment bank.

This fifteen month delay reflects either the Fed's lack of commitment to rooting out predatory practices at the largest company it regulates or, less plausible, the Fed's lack of resources.\nThroughout the summer, ICP provided the Fed with documents from inside CitiFinancial, including sales training scripts that instructed employees to ask an applicant how much they could pay per month then offer a package with insurance included, and documentation of scam \""}

To Citigroup it doesn't matter much: they needed the Federal Reserve approval in order to buy Golden State Bancorp. And Citigroup will claim that this approval vindicates them. Even the reforms that the Fed calls \"the Enhancements\" won't all go into effect until \"the end of 2003,\" according to the Order. It's a racket: perhaps the Fed exam can be kept going for another fifteen months, and then some other miniscule \"reforms\" announced.

Citigroup's dominance of its putative regulators continues -- as will this campaign. ICP has documented CitiFinancial's even more predatory practices in Mexico, India and elsewhere. The Fed states ICP's contentions about Citigroup's \"projects worldwide that might damage the environment or cause other social harm... contain no allegation of illegality or actions that would affect the safety and soundness of the institutions involved in the proposal.\" Footnote 83; in footnote 39 the Fed blows off allegations about Mexico. Not only will this campaign continue: it will expand. As they say, watch this space.\nFurther 10\/29\/02 update: on October 29, the Office of Thrift Supervision issued an eight-page approval letter. The OTS states that \"a federal [thrift] charter may be granted only to persons of 'good' character and responsibility... The FRB, in its approval of the related application... did rely on commitments and undertakings by Citigroup, designed in part to address issues raised in various comments... OTS has concluded that is appropriate to condition approval of the federal charter application on Citigroup complying with the commitments made to and conditions imposed by the FRB.\" But the Fed's approval noted that Citigroup's unreformed Primerica, which sells high-cost products of Citicorp Trust FSB, is regulated by the OTS; the Fed simply forwarded comments about this to the OTS. Now the OTS defers to and relies on the Federal Reserve, without even mentioning much less addressing this issue. Note that CitiFinancial still imposes single premium credit insurance on non-real estate loans and sells bogus \"property insurance\" on supposed collateral like fishing rods and ladders, and that \"bonuses for CitiFinancial sales people are tied to how much credit insurance they sell in conjunction with new loans.\" Fed Expands Citigroup Probe To Insurance-Sale Practices: In Approval of Golden State Purchase, Subprime-Lending Issues Are Detailed, by Rob Wells, Dow Jones \/ Wall Street Journal, October 29-30, 2002. We'll say it again (and again): for shame...\nUpdate of October 28, 2002: as the Federal Reserve prepared to vote on Citi - Golden State on October 28, ICP on October 27 submitted a comment to the Fed and other regulators, it is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's twenty-third comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a twenty-third comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nWe have seen that the Board has placed Citigroup's application on the agenda of its October 28 meeting. In light of the adverse matters that remain outstanding -- the numerous scandals that are swirling around Citigroup, the FRB's own October 9, 2002, deposition of various ex-CitiFinancial employees regarding predatory lending and insurance-sales practices, etc. -- ICP contends that the Board should not, and could not legitimately, consider approving Citigroup's application at this juncture.\nWhile Citigroup announced some relatively minor \"reforms\" during this process, none of the reforms are applicable to Citi's door-to-door Primerica unit, nor to CitiFinancial's \"non-real estate\" lending, which involves loans up to $7,500 at interest rates as high as 40% in addition to insurance"}
{"text":" that customers have not requested and that, in many cases, has no benefit to the insured. For example, CitiFinancial asks applicants for lists of \"household goods\" that they own, supposed as collateral for the loans. These lists, copies of which ICP timely submitted to the FRB, include items such as fishing rods, random video tapes, leaf blowers and step ladders. While CitiFinancial never repossesses such items, it nevertheless sells insurance on them. Employees have told ICP (and the FRBNY) that the only reason CitiFinancial compiles the lists is to sell insurance. Neither Citigroup's commitments to the FRB, nor the FTC proposed settlement, put an end to these practices.\nOn October 9 three FRBNY staffers conducted depositions of a number of ex-CitiFinancial employees. The FRB took sworn testimony that employees were trained to close loans while obscuring the documents with their forearms, were instructed to pitch \"joint\" insurance (that is, with one spouse co-signing for another) and on other matters. Citigroup has not, to our knowledge, submitted any rebuttal to this sworn testimony; the FRB has yet to provide the deponents, or ICP, with copies of the deposition transcripts. In fact, in two October letters to ICP, the FRB has unilaterally extended its time to provide, under the Freedom of Information Act, documents related to Citigroup - Golden State. See FRB letters of October 9, 2002 (No. 2002-100502) and October 16, 2002 (No. 2002-100503). ICP has noticed that the FRB likes to withhold documents until after the Board has ruled on applications. ICP contests this practice, and requests that this be brought to the attention of each Governor prior to his or her vote on Citigroup's application. Similarly the FRB waited up to three weeks to write-up summaries of its ex parte meetings with Citigroup, then waited still longer to send the summaries to ICP and other commenters.\nAs set forth below, last week the N.Y. Attorney General informed Sandy Weill that his \"interests\" could diverge from Citigroup's. The company and its CEO are under active investigation for conflicts of interest in stock recommendations; the Enron and WorldCom matters remains unresolved. At this juncture, how could the FRB even consider approving Citigroup's application to acquire Golden State Bancorp?\nSignificantly, Citigroup's most recent round of micro-reforms does not apply to loans through brokers. For the record, the National Mortgage News of October 21, 2002, at Page 53, reported that \" [b]eginning in this quarter, the CitiFinancial retail branch network will reduce the maximum points on real estate loans (including Section 32-HOEPA loans) from five percentage points to a maximum of three percentage points (or the lesser cap as allowed by state law.) A story on page two of our Sept. 23 issue, in error, reported that these changes would also effect mortgage brokers doing business with the company. CitiFinancial was contacted prior to the original press time of this story and was unavailable to respond in time to clarify. \"\nThe BHC Act's managerial and financial resources factors also militate for denial of Citigroup's applications in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup and its highest management, including its CEO.

(along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nIn light of the rampart irregularities documented at CitiFinancial, including in ICP's timely submissions in this proceeding, on October 9, 2002, an FRB team including Assistant Vice President Shari Leventhal, Yoon Hi Greene, Counsel, and Ms. Gretchen Downing, Bank Examiner, all of the FRBNY, traveled to Tennessee and conducted at least three depositions of ex-CitiFinancial employees. It is imperative that all evidence made available"}
{"text":" to the FRB on that date be followed-up and acted on, before the FRB even considers this application, other than for approval. Today, ICP submitted a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for all records related to the FRB' above-reference inquiry in Tennessee. Those documents, and further (withheld and\/or omitted) information regarding the FRB's ex parte communications with Citigroup, must be provided to ICP and other commenters before the FRB even considers this application, other than for approval.\nWe wish to provide this update to the FRB: following the FRB staffers' deposition-taking in Tennessee, at least three CitiFinancial staffers have been fired. The FRB should demand information in this regard from Citigroup.\nFor the record, Citigroup and Golden State have seemingly impermissibly jumped the gun on this proposed merger, which (obviously) does not have approval. See, e.g., the Los Angeles Times of October 16, 2002, \"Glitch at CalFed Blocks Accounts; ATM\/Visa check cards are deactivated amid merger preparations\" --\nCalifornia Federal Bank... left more than 9,000 customers stranded without access to their cash over the weekend after their ATM\/Visa check cards were mistakenly canceled, CalFed executives said Tuesday. In anticipation of its pending takeover by Citigroup Inc., CalFed officials decided to change account numbers and issue new cards for about 13,000 CalFed customers whose account numbers overlapped with accounts at Citigroup, the nation's largest bank. However, because of a \"programming glitch,\" cards were deactivated Friday for about 9,000 customers, said Janis Tarter, spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp, the parent of California Federal Bank. The cards can be used to make debit and credit purchases and to get cash from automated teller machines. \"We apologize sincerely for the error,\" Tarter said. \"Once the merger closes, we wanted to make sure we had taken care of everything in advance to minimize disruption.\"\nICP formally asks the FRB and other agencies to inquire into and act on this \"jumping-the-gun,\" which implies that the banks have either been assured of approvals or are entirely cavalier about the convenience and needs of their customers (and communities).\nThe BHC Act's managerial and financial resources factors also militate for denial of Citigroup's applications in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup and its highest management, including its CEO. For the record, see the Houston Chronicle of October 15, 2002 [snip]\nUpdate of October 14, 2002: in light of depositions of ex-CitiFinancial employees conducted by Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff members on October 9 (see Update of October 11, below), and the settlement between Household International and various state regulators announced October 11, ICP on October 14 submitted a supplemental comment to the Federal Reserve, OTS and FDIC; it is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's twenty-first comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a twenty-first comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nIn July 2002, and on September 5 and 16, 2002, the FRB allowed Citigroup to make ex parte presentations about its settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and certain California-based class actions lawyers. On September 17, the FRB asked Citigroup certain questions, and on October 9, three staff members of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\"FRBNY\") deposed at least three ex-employees of CitiFinancial regarding CitiFinancial's training and sales practices. Those depositions will be addressed infra: first, ICP wishes to formally take part of the record the settlement announced by various state regulators and Household International on October 11, 2002.\nThe state regulators' settlement with Household, unlike the FTC's and class action lawyers' Sept. 19 settlement with Citigroup, contains injunctive relief and required reforms. (As previously noted, so did the FTC's settlement earlier this year with First Alliance). Also, while Citigroup would be obtaining a near-total release of claims for its victims (estimated by the FTC at two million people), the Household settlement and release explicitly allow those who accept payments to be able to raise their claims as defenses to judicial or non-judicial foreclosure actions.\nThree quick comparisons, for the record: the Citigroup settlement that the FTC"}
{"text":" and California-based class action lawyers announced on September 19 would spread $240 million among two million victims: an average of $120 apiece. The Household settlement splits $484 million among an estimated 310,000 victims: over $1,500 apiece. Citigroup's victims would be require to release all of their claims; Household's victims could retain their claims as defenses to foreclosure. And, most significant to ICP (and presumably to the agencies), whereas reforms were required from Household, no such reforms were required from Citigroup, despite CitiFinancial's continued imposition of single premium credit insurance on non-real estate consumer loans, solicitation of lists of household goods like fishing rods and ice chests in order to sell insurance on them, etc.. For the record, the Citigroup settlement, proposed on September 19, is looking more and more like a product of a reserve auction and\/or of \"disarmed counsel.\" See, e.g., Cheryl Reynolds, et al. v. Beneficial National Bank and H&R Block, 288 F.3d 277 (2002).\nAnd so the FRB (and OTS and FDIC) cannot legitimately rely on the proposed settlement announced on September 19 as resolved the adverse issues timely raised in this proceeding (in fact, quite the contrary: Citigroup's attempt to extinguish the claims of two million customers, even as defenses against foreclosure, is scandalous). Rather, the FRB must follow-up on the record before it, and the sworn deposition testimony it collected on October 9, 2002 (these depositions should be made part of the record before the Board and other agencies). For the record:\nOn October 9, three staff members from the FRBNY were in Tennessee deposing ex-CitiFinancial employees. They took sworn deposition testimony concerning how CitiFinancial employees are trained and how disclosures are made to CitiFinancial customers. While those deposed [FN: And ICP in advance of the depositions] urged the FRB to go into CitiFinancial branches and obtain certain documents before they can be moved or destroyed, this was not done. However, the FRB now has in its possession documents and sworn deposition testimony that evidence current predatory practices at CitiFinancial. This must have ramifications on Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp -- i.e., on the current record, Citigroup's applications could not legitimately be approved.\nThose deposed made the FRB aware that CitiFinancial employees including district manager Nancy Neel have recently been observed removing and shredding documents. Also, among the trainers listed was Mr. Ed Starkey, now a higher-up within CitiFinancial. The FRBNY staff members were provided with a number of documents, including sample print-outs from CitiFinancial's Maestro computer system, sample ROCopoly bonus reports (showing the pressure on employees to sell insurance), and sample sales training scripts. They asked: why do these documents have exhibit numbers on them? Answer: Because ICP had already submitted them to the Fed, opposing Citi-Golden State. Our question: if the FRB did not even ensure that the staffers sent to conduct this inquiry were aware of the exhibits timely submitted in this proceeding, how serious and\/or professional is the FRB's inquiry and review?\nThe BHC Act's managerial and financial resources factors also militate for denial of Citigroup's applications in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup and its highest management, including its CEO. For the record, see the WALL STREET JOURNAL, October 10, 2002, Thursday, Section A; Page 1, Column 1, CITIGROUP NOW HAS NEW WORRY: WHAT GRUBMAN WILL SAY [snip]\nUpdate of October 11, 2002: on October 9, three attorneys from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were in Tennessee deposing ex-CitiFinancial employees. The Fed representatives' questions focused on how CitiFinancial employees are trained and how disclosures are made to CitiFinancial customers. While those deposed, and Inner City Press in advance of the depositions, urged the Fed to go into CitiFinancial branches and obtain certain documents before they can be moved or destroyed, this was not done. However, the Fed now has in its possession documents and sworn deposition testimony that evidence current predatory practices at CitiFinancial. This must have ramifications on Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp, and otherwise.\nIn a September 23 comment to the Federal Reserve (summarized below on this page), Inner City Press recounted the tale of Kelly Raleigh, a CitiFinancial employee who had just be fired based on Citi's (erroneous) suspicion that she was the source of documents ICP had previously obtained, submitted and reported on. On September 30, ICP chided the Fed for failing to have contacted Ms. Raleigh. The following week, Ms. Raleigh was contacted by Ms. Shari Leventhal, an Assistant Vice President at the New"}
{"text":" York Fed, and an appointment for deposition was made.\nMs. Raleigh made the Fed aware, among other things, of documentation of particular fraudulent loans, and that CitiFinancial employees including district manager Nancy Neel had recently been observed removing and shredding documents. For that reason, ICP did not report the New York Fed's visit to Tennessee before it took place (that is, to make further shredding less likely). Now that the three Fed representatives have come and gone (without seeking to obtain the documents Ms. Raleigh told them about) -- now, it can be told.\nAccompanying Ms. Leventhal were Ms. Yoon Hi Greene, Counsel, and Ms. Gretchen Downing, Bank Examiner, both of the New York Fed. On the morning of October 9, ex-CitiFinancial employee Roy Cook was deposed for more than two hours in a conference room at the Holiday Inn Express in downtown Knoxville. The Fed lawyers' questions included: How were you trained to sell insurance? How were you trained to disclose APR and rate? How were you trained to encourage joint applications (that is, co-signers), and to sell joint insurance? And who trained you to do these things?\nAmong the trainers listed were Mr. Ed Starkey, now a higher-up within CitiFinancial. Supervising CitiFinancial during this time frame were Chuck Prince, Bob Willumstad, Marge Magner and others. The Fed also asked about so-called \"defensive loans,\" in which CitiFinancial seeks to convert unsecured debt into a lien against the customer's home or auto. The Fed examiners were provided with a number of documents, including sample print-outs from CitiFinancial's Maestro computer system, sample ROCopoly bonus reports (showing the pressure on employees to sell insurance), and sample sales training scripts. They asked: why do these documents have exhibit numbers on them? Answer: Because Inner City Press has already submitted them to the Fed, opposing Citi-Golden State.\nThat the New York Fed attorneys claimed to be unaware of CitiFinancial documents that ICP submitted in timely opposition to Citi's Golden State application, from June 3 onwards, was surprising. It reflects either that the Fed staffers only superficially prepared for their journey to Tennessee or that the Federal Reserve Board wants to confine the ongoing problems at CitiFinancial to some confidential slow-boat outside of the merger application process. Neither explanation reflects well on the Fed.\nAlready, the Fed has withheld \"eight linear feet\" of documents concerning its review of CitiFinancial, in response to a FOIA request from ICP. Throughout September, the Fed allowed Citigroup lawyers to privately brief them, with no notice (and only cursory summaries) to commenters against the Citi-Golden State deal. These briefing included Citigroup's spin on its proposed settlement of predatory lending claims with the FTC and certain California-based class action attorneys (the problems with this settlement are analyzed below on this page). We report these facts now, to do what we can to make clear what the Fed knew, and when they knew it. As to Citigroup's knowledge, we note that we've been reporting on these predatory lending issues, specifically in Tennessee, since February 2002. Inner City Press raised the issues, in person, to the new Solomon CEO, at that time, and to Citigroup's overall CEO at the company's annual meeting in April 2002. Ignore and\/or try to cover-up a (predatory lending) problem long enough, and it just might just get malignant...\nUpdate of October 7, 2002: ICP today submitted a comment to the FRB, OTS and FDIC; for the Fed's non-compliance with its own rules against ex parte communications, see ICP's October 2, 2002, CitiWatch Report.\nRE: ICP's twentieth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a twentieth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nFirst, ICP formally demands an explanation from the FRB as to why it conducted ex parte meetings with Citigroup on September 5, 13 and 16, including on issues related to the predatory lending concerns timely documents by ICP in this proceeding -- without giving any notice to ICP, and providing only cursory and redacted summaries weeks after the fact. On October 1, ICP received from the FRB by regular mail a slew of correspondence between Citigroup"}
{"text":" and the FRB, reaching as far back as September 5, 2002. These material should have been sent to ICP and others at the time, but weren't. Let's review:\nAccording to an FRB memo dated September 23, 2002, on September 5 four Citigroup attorneys met with Fed staff \"to discuss the status\" of the FTC's predatory lending case against Citigroup. \"The discussion lasted approximately 40 minutes,\" according to the FRB memo. None of the timely commenters opposing Citi-Golden State were informed of this meeting, much less allowed to participate. In fact, the FRB inexplicably delayed 18 days before memorializing the meeting in a memo, and a further three days before sending this memo out.\nAt the September 5 meeting, according to the delayed memo, Citigroup \"outlined the terms of the proposed settlement reached between Citigroup and FTC staff.\" Citigroup \"stressed that, although the FTC settlement would contain no injunctive relief, Citigroup and CitiFinancial would voluntarily implement additional polices and procedures (the 'Enhancements') to CitiFinancial's insurance sales practices to safeguard against abusive practices in CitiFinancial's subprime lending operations.\"\nWe note that Citigroup has since stated that these \"Enhancements\" to not even purport to apply to PFS, Citigroup's Primerica Financial Services, which is also (at least partially) a Citigroup \"subprime lending operation.\"\nWe further question how meaningful are these since-announced reforms, largely consisting of new consumer brochures, not dissimilar to those already in place (and already being ignored) at CitiFinancial?\nThe Fed's September 23 memorialization of the September 5 meeting has numerous redactions, including of whole paragraphs. ICP hereby demands access to this improperly withheld information under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") and, directly, under the FRB's rules against ex parte communications.\nThe next contact which the FRB has now belated disclosed took place on September 13, 2002. This meeting lasted two hours and fifteen minutes, and involved Citigroup's Charles Prince, Todd Thomson, Joan Guggenheimer, Stephanie Mudnick and Michael Zuckert. The FRB memo states:\n\"Mr. Prince provided an overview of Citigroup's analysis of the various securities-related issues and how Citigroup was addressing those issues... He also responded to System staff's inquiries about the additional responsibilities of Citigroup's senior management in light of the recently announced managerial changes.... As an update, Ms. Mudnick advised that the FTC was expected to publicly announce the settlement on Thursday, September 19... She added that, on September 12, CitiFinancial has sent a memo to all of its branches concerning these changes... Mr. Thomson discussed the impact of all these matters on evaluations of Citigroup by the rating agencies and Citigroup's finances. He also discussed certain other matters related to Citigroup's financial strength.\"\nThis cursory Fed memo does not have any explicit redactions on it. The reason? The memo is so general as to be meaningless. This was an ex parte contact of which no notice was provided, and of which only the most vague notes have now been provided. This must be corrected, to the degree it can be, before the FRB even considers Citigroup's application, other than for denial.\nNext, on September 16, FRB staff spoke with Citigroup's Carl Howard for ninety minutes \"to clarify certain additional policies and procedures regarding CitiFinancial's insurance sales practices. This six-page Fed memo, dated September 24, is substantially redacted. It refers to a letter sent to the FRB on September 11 by Citigroup's outside counsel, Stacey McGinn at Skadden Arps.\nThis September 11 letter, which was supposed to be sent to ICP at that time, was only provided by Citigroup on October 1, along with another week-old document, Citigroup's September 23 letter to the FRB. This letter includes Citigroup's responses to \"Questions from the Federal Reserve dated September 17\" -- questions that the FRB should have, but didn't (and still hasn't) sent to ICP, under the FRB's own rules. Among Citigroup's undated answers is this Q & A:\n\"Do the new best practices apply to PFS?\"\n\"No. The best practices were designed expressly to address the concerns raised regarding insurance sales within the CitiFinancial branch-based business.\"\nThis is significant, given predatory lending issues that have been raised about the sales practices of PFS \/ Primerica. The Q&A also re-confirms that CitiFinancial continues to sell single premium credit insurance on non-real estate loans (which is more than half of its business).\nThe FRB and Citigroup have both improperly withheld notice of and information about their discussions throughout the month of September 2002, in flagrant disregard for the FRB's own prohibition on ex parte communications. Citigroup's Chuck"}
{"text":" Prince, et al., were allowed to make ex parte presentations to FRB staff for over two hours on September 13, with no notice to timely commenters opposing the Citigroup - Golden State application pending before the FRB. Citigroup's \"reforms\" do not address PFS \/ Primerica at all, and hardly address CitiFinancial's non-real estate lending, which continues to including single premium credit insurance and insurance on such items as fishing rods, ice chests and leaf blowers. Citigroup remains a predatory lender.\nMore than before, it is clear to ICP that the FRB could not legitimately consider approving Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp at this time. [FN] Now that more is known about the proposed settlement orders in the Federal Trade Commission's (the \"FTC's\") and California class action lawyers' predatory lending cases against Citigroup, ICP wishes to formally raise additional questions not only about the FTC's failure to obtain reforms of CitiFinancial (see ICP's last comments), but also about the propriety (and adequacy) of the $25 million settlement (and related $20 - $25 million attorneys fee) for Associates flipping victims on a purportedly nationwide basis. The California class actions to which the FTC chose to tie its proposed settlement were only filed in February 2002. The cases have not yet been certified as a class even as to California customers, much less nationwide. In fact, the class action lawyers in these cases have repeated failed to get earlier cases certified as class actions. ICP has been contacted by plaintiffs' attorneys in other states, with cases against CitiFinancial, who were explicitly solicited by Citigroup's in-house lawyers, including Martin Wong (who signed the FTC settlement for Citigroup), as to whether they might wish to turn their cases into class actions and settle them. While this seems counter-intuitive, the explanation is that Citigroup was looking for a national class action to settle on the cheap (here, $25 million), while extinguishing the rights of millions of consumers.\nSettlement of these still uncertified California cases would result in up to two million customers waiving (that is, losing) their claims. Importantly, the release that customers would sign in those cases would mean that defenses of fraud and flipping could not be used even to oppose subsequent foreclosure cases brought by CitiFinancial. So the settlement would be not only convenient, but also lucrative, to Citigroup.\nWhat's perhaps most significant in all this is Citigroup's encouraging of class actions. {FN: For now we can attribute such entreaties to Citigroup's Martin Wong (who signed for Citigroup on the FTC settlement). It is believed that the strategy comes from above Mr. Wong: in particular, now Solomon Brothers CEO Charles O. Prince, III[.ICP is explicitly raising this, in extraordinary circumstances, under the managerial resources factor that the FRB must consider in connection with Citigroup's applications.\nThe BHC Act's managerial and financial resources factors also militate for denial of Citigroup's applications in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup. For the record, Time magazine of October 7, 2002 [snip]\nUpdate of September 30, 2002: Now that the proposed settlement orders in the FTC's and California class action lawyers' cases against Citigroup are public, questions have arisen not only about the FTC's failure to obtain reforms of CitiFinancial, but also about the adequacy of the $25 million settlement for Associates flipping victims on a purportedly nationwide basis. On September 30, ICP submitted a comment to the FRB, OTS and FDIC raising these and other questions. The comment is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's nineteenth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a nineteenth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc.

The California class actions to which the FTC chose to tie its proposed settlement were only filed in February 2002. The cases have not yet been certified as a class even as to California customers, much less nationwide."}
{"text":" Nevertheless the proposed California settlement provides for attorneys fees of between $20 and $25 million dollars: as much as the \"flipping\" redress that Citigroup is offering.\nICP had wondered, at sought at the FTC's September 19 press conference to ask, whether customers obtaining the FTC-proposed \"Redress\" (said to average $1,000) would be releasing any or all claims against Citigroup. FTC Chairman Muris pointedly prohibited ICP from asking any follow-up question, despite earlier allowing others as many as three questions. Now from the documents made available, ICP concludes: customers would be releasing all claims, explicitly including claims that are not presently aware of (even if this were through Citigroup's own withholding of information).\nThe proposed settlement of the California \"class\" actions recites (inaccurately) that Citigroup \"has adopted a series of consumer-oriented initiatives that address concerns raised by...consumer groups...\". And see infra. Citigroup's reforms to date have not resolved the issues raised by consumer groups including ICP, including but not limited to systemic misrepresentations made in connection with consumer loans, the continued sale of single premium credit insurance on personal loans, the fraudulent collection of property lists as purported collateral for personal loans and the sale of (useless) property insurance on such items as fishing rods, ice chests and lawn mowers. See ICP's timely exhibits submitted to date in this proceeding.\nIt is illuminative to compare the settlement that FTC requested and obtained from First Alliance earlier this year with its September 19 proposed settlement with Citigroup. In the First Alliance case, the FTC requested and obtained a list of prohibited business practices, including no misleading representations (including regarding the purported benefits of bill consolidation), and no future Truth in Lending Act violations. The FTC's First Alliance settlement explicitly states that the FTC can obtain discovery, and can use mystery shoppers at First Alliance or its successors. ICP formally asks: why did the FTC not obtain any of these things from Citigroup? The FTC's proposed settlement states (and this is to be evaluated and confirmed or denied by the court) that it is \"in the public interest.\" We think not. Nor does the proposed settlement resolve the outstanding issues of predatory lending that are of record in this proceeding.\nIn a Bloomberg News transcript dated September 23, 2002, Citigroup's Robert Willumstad said \"more importantly, the actual product itself, single premium credit insurance, we actually discontinued. \" That is not true: CitiFinancial continues to this date to sell single premium credit insurance on its non-real estate loans, a substantial part of its business. Then, in response to a question (\"has the work that you've had to do with Associates to I guess, for lack of a better word, clean it up helped you to uncover things that needed improvement throughout CitiFinancial?\") Mr. Willumstad stated \"Well, not specifically. Again, CitiFinancial has a long history. It's been in business for about 90 years and certainly going back to the almost 16 years now that it's been associated with Citigroup or the predecessor company, Travelers, has had really, I think, an impeccable record of having no regulatory problems, no legal action against it.\" Emphasis added. That's also not true, as the record before the agencies in this proceeding show: the litigation list, etc.. Also incorrect was Mr. Willumstad's response to the question \"are there other outstanding lawsuits against Associates that you still have to deal with?\" -- he stated, \"We really think this puts virtually every one of them behind us. I mean this was the principal issue for the Associates. Again, it was sales practices around insurance. So we really do think this puts virtually all of it behind us.\" Again, see the litigation list that the agencies have request, and Citigroup has filed, in this proceeding.\nBeyond community groups and consumers, there are others beginning to raise these questions. As simply one example: ICP was contacted last week by the lawyers for an on-going (and as opposed to the California cases, long-standing) class action against Citigroup on predatory lending issues. These lawyers are dubious of the proposed settlements, including because their state's law would provide for substantially more redress than the $25 million proposed in the California-based (but now purportedly nationwide) cases. These lawyers state that in the months prior to the FTC's September 19 announcement, they met with and provided documents to the FTC, including named counsel Lucy Morris. Leading up to September 19, Citigroup's lawyers called them to inquire if they were ready to settle, on terms they found inadequate for their clients. When they expressed doubts about the adequacy of the offer(s), both Citigroup's lawyers and the FTC stopped returning their calls. Now, after September 19, they have attempted to contact the plaintiffs' lawyers in the California purported nationwide class actions, and none of their calls have been returned. They state, of \"Citi's"}
{"text":" effort to have the California class action 'include' a national class\" that this \"is a fraud upon a fraud if you ask us.\" It's hard to disagree...\nMore that the agencies should look into: a CitiFinancial loan, from its Morristown TN office, to Linda Bowers. The loan documents provided to Ms. Bowers list one witness, but on CitiFInancial's copy there are two witnesses listed. CitiFinancial employee Sherri Lee closed the loan and hard-sold the insurance; after three years of payments Ms. Bowers' payoff is $4,000 more than what it was the day she took out the loan. Sherri Lee is one of the suspended employees (the \"Morristown Three,\" see below and ICP's last comment). There's also a lien that CitiFinancial attached to a Tennessee property without the consent of one of a title-holders, an eight-year old child. The loan was made in October 2001 and flipped in March 2002. Also pressing is another sample Morristown loan, to Linda Clark. Despite Ms. Clark's current severe illness, her insurance documents were forged \/ fraudulently procured.\nAn update on last week's comment: while the \"Morristown Three\" remain on suspension, it is reported that district manager Jim Chakales is back on the job -- reconfirming that when violations occur, it is only the lower-level employees who suffer consequences, not district managers or regional managers or higher. And so it goes. Serious questions have been raised under, inter alia, the managerial resources statutory factor that the FRB, OTS and FDIC must consider in this proceeding. The agencies must forthwith inquire into the facts recounted above, and take action thereon. On the current record, the agencies could not legitimately consider approving Citigroup's applications.\nThis is also true in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup, which provide a separate basis for both the (still-) requested hearing and for the denial of this Citigroup expansion application, under the BHC Act's managerial resources factor and otherwise. For the record, the Washington Post of September 24, 2002 [snip]\nUpdate of September 23, 2002: Having critiqued the Federal Trade Commission's deceptive settlement with Citigroup the day it was announced (see ICP's CitiWatch Report of September 19), we've devoted our September 23 comments to the Fed, OTS and FDIC to an insider's view of CitiFinancial.

(along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nOn September 19, 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") held a press conference announcing a proposed settlement of its predatory lender case against Citigroup. ICP wishes first to emphasize that this proposed settlement does not resolve the issues pending before the FRB, and that the FRB has inquired into. The FRB, based in part on exhibits obtained and submitted by ICP, has inquired into current CitiFinancial practices, including non-real estate consumer lending and insurance practices. None of these are addressed by the FTC's proposal settlement. We ask: given, for example, the affidavit of longtime CitiFinancial employee Gail Kubiniec which the FTC obtained and filed, why does the FTC's proposed settlement only offer \"redress\" (averaging only $1,000) to customers of Associates from 1995 into 2000, and not customers of CitiFinancial? Why are none of the consumer lending and insurance practices -- for example, CitiFinancial continues to hard-sell single premium credit insurance on such loans -- addressed? We demand that the FRB address these issues, in this proceeding.\nWe are submitting this supplemental comment in extraordinary circumstances (as set forth below); it should be made part of the record before the Board. This submission addressed issues of retaliation against whistleblowers at CitiFinancial, including in connection with the exhibits ICP has submitted to the FRB, OTS and FDIC. Accordingly these agencies, including the FRB, are morally (and legally, we contend) bound to act on the issues set forth below.\nICP last week interviewed a long-time CitiFinancial employee who was recently fired for whistle-blowing: that is, for reporting widespread consumer protection violations in the CitiFinancial region where she worked. Her name is Kelly Raleigh. She"}
{"text":" began working at what was then the Sandy Weill-run Commercial Credit in 1990. After the merger with Citicorp it was renamed CitiFinancial. As recounted below -- along with break-out questions from ICP -- she was brow-beaten from April through July 2002, was suspended in July, and \"terminated\" in August.\nKelly Raleigh went to work for Commercial Credit in 1990. Through her twelve year career, she would work at and, later, manage, a half-dozen different offices of Commercial Credit then the renamed CitiFinancial. As she was promoted from loan officer to branch manager, she began to see more and more irregularities. She states that she was trained to close loans while covering the actual loan documents with her forearm, so the customer couldn't read them. She declined to do this, choosing instead to describe to the customer the terms of the loan.\nEven when the company was named Commercial Credit, it required \"property lists\" of household items to purportedly secure consumer loans averaging $5,000 to $7,000. Employees were directed to sell insurance on these household items. ICP has previously timely submitted evidence of CitiFinancial insurance sold on ice chests and fishing rods; Ms. Raleigh describes a loan to an elderly woman that was \"secured\" by a ladder, on which insurance was sold. Routinely, personal property insurance was sold to customers who already had comprehensive (and expensive) homeowner's insurance: a process known as \"double-dipping\" in which the second insurance policy has no benefit to the customer. Ms. Raleigh states that CitiFinancial employees routinely doctored insurance applications for customers to make them eligible for insurance (selling unemployment insurance to housewives \/ home-makers, and changing the ages and medical history of customers). The reason? To get bonuses, employees had to hit ever-rising insurance sales \"penetration levels.\"\nMs. Raleigh's real troubles, however, began when she became aware that CitiFinancial was illegally collecting on a loan, and had been for a number of years. The loan was a second mortgage made by the Morristown, Tennessee office. When the borrower died, CitiFinancial did not go to court and obtain a judgment: rather it began collecting from the deceased borrower's son. They pressured the son to put up his car as collateral. When Ms. Raleigh became aware of the illegal collection practices, she raised the issue up through the chain of command: to her district manager Jim Chakales, to her regional manager David Baer, and, as recounted further below, even higher. But nothing was ever done: the Morristown branch manager Lisa Wilcox wrote a memo claiming that the borrower was still alive. Ms. Raleigh was instructed to \"quit being a cry-baby and just do it\" -- that is, collect on it. By then the loan had been transferred from the Morristown office to the Jefferson City office, where Ms. Raleigh was branch manager and therefore in charge of continuing to collect on the loan. She refused to keep collecting, and advised the original (and deceased) borrower's son to seek a refund. She told her supervisors she had given this advise -- \"since I have to live with myself,\" she told them.\nThere were other CitiFinancial practices Ms. Raleigh began to complain about. When she started working at Commercial Credit, the \"qualifying level\" of insurance sales required to get a bonus was set to 81. Later, under CitiFinancial, this minimum was raised to 100: that is, insurance sales on an ever-larger percentage of loans. Also, while CitiFinancial's Maestro computer system who show the loan officer CitiFinancial's \"best prices,\" employees were directed to request higher interest rates from borrowers. The Maestro computer system might show that 10% interest could be offered: but employees were supposed to offer a 14% interest rate.\nWhen in February 2002 ICP began to report in detail on systemic predatory lending by CitiFinancial, including documentation from branches in Tennessee -- Citigroup's Responses in this proceeding have acknowledged their awareness of these ICP Reports, from the beginning -- Ms. Raleigh and others were summoned to a meeting in the CitiFinancial office in Kingston Pike, Tennessee. The date was April 4, 2002: Ms. Raleigh was told to go to Kingston Pike and to not tell anyone she was going there. Inside, a CitiFinancial auditor from Baltimore named Keith Black was waiting, along with a CitiFinancial outside counsel named Clarence Rison and his associate Ginger Browning. Ms. Raleigh states that she was told that this was a deposition; she was questioned about any knowledge she had of documents being \"leaked\" from CitiFinancial offices. Ms. Raleigh said she had no knowledge. The following day, they visited her at the Jefferson City office, asking pointedly if she had anything else to say. She didn't.\nOn June 3, 2002, ICP submitted to the FRB, OTS and FDIC documentation of, for"}
{"text":" example, CitiFinancial insurance sold on fishing rods and ice chests, and various internal CitiFinancial memoranda and sales training scripts. See ICP's Exhibits. On June 25, 2002, Ms. Raleigh was summoned to the CitiFinancial's Broadway office, where she met with Mr. Rison and another CitiFinancial official: James E. Cappola, the Director of Investigations of Corporate Security for CitiFinancial. At these meeting, Ms. Raleigh described at length the consumer protection compliance violations she had witnessed, including illegal collections from a dead man's son, forgery by employees on insurance documents, and systemic distortion of delinquency. To obtain bonuses, reported delinquencies can only be so high. But the numbers can be distorted by, for example, canceling insurance policies so that insurance premium can be reallocated to loan payments. Ms. Raleigh also corroborated ICP's earlier account of distortion of delinquency by district manager Chakales: the invocation of \"blizzard deferments\" on loans when no snow had, in fact, fallen.\nMr. Rison expressed doubts about all of this, according to Ms. Raleigh. \"Are you really saying that Mr. Chakales did that?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" said Ms. Raleigh.\nI think you're mis-remembering things, Mr. Rison insisted, again and again.\n\"So I guess you're going to fire me,\" Ms. Raleigh finally said.\n\"No,\" said CitiFinancial's Mr. Cappola. \"You cannot be fired for saying this. We're here to get the facts and get this thing fixed.\"\nBut it soon became clear to Ms. Raleigh that the \"thing\" that CitiFinancial wanted to \"get fixed\" was the leaking of documents reflecting CitiFinancial's practices, and not the practices themselves. On June 26, 2002, the day after the meeting at the Broadway office, Ms. Raleigh was confronted in the Jefferson City office and asked again: who is leaking? Who is keeping diaries of our practices? By now Ms. Raleigh had contacted an attorney, and she told Mr. Rison and his colleagues that she was represented by counsel, and not to talk with her anymore.\nBut on July 3, regional manager David Baer and district manager Jim Chakales came to the Jefferson City office and told her she was suspended. When she asked why, she was not given a reason. Rather, Mr. Chakales said that he'd happily take a lay off to fix this, to stop this leaking. Just after this, Mr. Chakales went out to tell employees that Ms. Raleigh was being replaced (that is, not simply suspended).\nAs previously timely raised to the agencies -- but now understood -- immediately following CitiFinancial's July 3, 2002, suspension of Ms. Raleigh, CitiFinancial changed the locks on her office in Jefferson City, and at the Morristown office as well. Morristown employees were interviewed over two days, and district manager Nancy Neel was observed removing documents from the Morristown to Jefferson City office, where she was observed shredding the documents. Only then was an audit of the Morristown office performed: an audit that the Morristown office not surprisingly passed. This calls into question much of what Citigroup has said, in this proceeding, about its audits. What might these shredded documents have reflected? It has been suggested to ICP that they consisted of the paper trail of various fraudulent loans: transactions in which, to sell insurance, customers' ages were changed (so that the age on the ID documents and the applications forms were different); documents concerning loans that CitiFinancial had been illegally collecting on, etc..\nOver the next week, Ms. Raleigh went to spend time with her family. Mr. Chakales was leaving her daily messages on her cell phone: \"We need to speak to you.\" On July 15, 2002, Ms. Raleigh went to a Ruby Tuesday's restaurant to meet with Mr. Baer. When she got there, Mr. Baer announced that he was waiting for one more person. When this person arrived, it was a female attorney. \"But I'm represented by a lawyer,\" Ms. Raleigh said again. \"You can't have a lawyer question me without my own lawyer here.\" But the questioning proceeded: Ms. Raleigh was asked to provide the names of the people leaking information or she would be prosecuted.\n\"For what?\" she demanded. When the question wasn't answered, she called her lawyer on her cell phone, who told her to leave Ruby Tuesday's immediately. She did.\nQuestion: How is Ms. Raleigh's suspension and termination consistent with Citigroup's claims, to the Federal Reserve, to ICP and to the public, that they protect and do not retaliate against whistle-blowers -- much less that they want to \"do the right thing, every time\"?\nOn August 13, 2002, Kelly Raleigh received a letter of termination, dated August 7, 2002"}
{"text":", and labeled \"Overnight Delivery.\" The letter tersely stated that the cause was her refusal to cooperate with Company management regarding a violation of company policy. The \"Company Policy\" referred to must be a policy against whistle-blowing: because Ms. Raleigh repeatedly sought to report and cooperate regarding exposing and changing violations of consumer protection policies and laws.\nSince then, Citigroup's outside counsel has written that Ms. Raleigh is not a whistleblower under Tennessee law, and apparently now claims that Ms. Raleigh either never brought up consumer protection violations, or that these are not the reason she was suspended and terminated. But the facts, verifiable by the agencies including the FRB, don't and won't bear this out.\nJust prior to submission of this comment in extraordinary circumstance, ICP was told that manager Lisa Wilcox and two other employees of the Morristown office have been suspended for 30 days each; district manager Jim Chakales has reportedly been suspended \"indefinitely, pending investigation.\" But are even these actions -- which the agencies including the FRB should inquire into and confirm -- taken months after the facts began to be reported and documented by ICP, sufficient? On September 16, 2002, CitiFinancial CEO Mike Knapp issued a memo purporting to announce additional \"reforms\" in CitiFinancial's insurance sales practices. On September 19, after the announced proposed settlement of the FTC's predatory lending case (with both Citigroup and the FTC claiming that the problems were limited to Associates First Capital -- which had and has nothing to do with the above-recounted), Citigroup's Bob Willumstad claimed that CitiFinancial is a leader in the consumer finance industry. Mr. Willumstad long presided over Commercial Credit then CitiFinancial; many of the policies and practices described above were designed under his watch. The more specific chain of command up which Ms. Raleigh's and others' complaints rose, but were ignored, went as follows: district managers Jim Chakales and Nancy Neel; regional manager David Baer; then Don Laney, then K.C. Meade, then Mike Knapp, the current CEO of CitiFinancial. Serious questions have been raised under, inter alia, the managerial resources statutory factor that the FRB, OTS and FDIC must consider in this proceeding. The agencies must forthwith inquire into the facts recounted above, and take action thereon. On the current record, the agencies could not legitimately consider approving Citigroup's applications.\nThis is also true in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup, which provide a separate basis for both the (still-) requested hearing and for the denial of this Citigroup expansion application, under the BHC Act's managerial resources factor and otherwise. For the record, The Guardian (London) of September 21, 2002 [snip]\nUpdate of September 18, 2002: Sources tell Inner City Press that the Federal Trade Commission plans to hold a press conference on Thursday, September 19, in order to announce its settlement with Citigroup of predatory lending charges. As reported below, this settlement does far less than it should. Left untouched, for example, are CitiFinancial's abusive insurance sales practices, particularly in connection with non-real estate consumer loans. CitiFinancial's Mike Knapp's September 16 memo, characterized by Citigroup and in the press as a \"series of reforms,\" in substance changes very little. On insurance, the memo trumpets CitiFinancial's current practice, then says that a new \"consumer-friendly brochure will be added,\" for example. The N.Y. Times of September 16, after adopting CitiFinancial's definition of credit insurance as \" credit insurance, an optional product meant to cover monthly payments if the borrower is seriously injured or dies,\" quotes Bob Willumstud that \"We continue to look at ways to improve the sales process... The complexity of the sales process means there is big potential for misunderstandings.\"\nBut it's no misunderstanding: CitiFinancial's compensation scheme, called ROCopoly, requires employees to hit particular levels of insurance sales in order to get their bonuses. This is why insurance is hard-sold at CitiFinancial, and it will continue. Also apparently slated to continue is CitiFinancial's practice of obtaining \"property lists\" as supposed collateral for personal loans -- including such items as fishing rods, ice chests and self-recorded video tapes on the lists, then selling insurance on them. This insurance is fraudulent per se, in that CitiFinancial admits it does not foreclose on or repossess such \"household items.\" There's no misunderstanding here: CitiFinancial is a predatory lender. The FTC's too-limited settlement does not change that, nor does Citigroup's laughable \"reform\" memo of September 16.\nThe FTC's failure to act on these problems at CitiFinancial -- after collecting affidavits about them, and asking ICP and other groups for documentation -- is akin to a police officer asking a neighborhood resident to help in an investigation"}
{"text":", and then refusing to act on the information provided. In advance of the FTC's September 19 press conference (and the Federal Reserve ruling on Citi-Golden State which will apparently follow thereafter), we say: for shame. That the Fed is preparing to approve Citi's Golden State application is foreshadowed by a front-page article in the September 18 American Banker, noting that Citi buttressed its consumer finance sales practices last year during the approval process for EAB. It promised to stop selling single-premium credit insurance and to improve its record of lending in minority communities. The Fed gave its approval for the EAB transaction one week later.\" The article reports: Steve Silverman, a spokesman for Citi, said: \"We continue to work with regulators\" on the Golden State deal, \"which we believe is on track to close shortly.\" Hey, Citigroup's September 16 was even less meaningful than what Citi announced during the EAB proceeding. How low can you go?\nUpdate of September 16, 2002: While the FTC tries to placate Citigroup by ignoring evidence against CitiFinancial that the FTC has requested and obtained, and on the eve of another half-way reform announcement by CitiFinancial (see below), ICP submitted a comment on these matters to the Federal Reserve, OTS and FDIC. It is summarized below\nRE: ICP's seventeenth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a seventeenth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nThe American Banker of September 16, 2002 (\"Citi Revamps Policy on Credit Insurance,\" Pg. 20) reports [snip]\nGiven that Monday's American Banker newspaper is finalized the previous Friday, it appears clear that Citigroup leaked the announcement. ICP has not yet seen the referenced memorandum from CitiFinancial's Mike Knapp. The FRB should obtain this document, release it to ICP and the public, and allow comment thereon in this proceeding. As the exhibits ICP has timely submitted in this proceeding make clear, any \"reform\" that does not meaningfully address CitiFinancial's personal consumer lending and insurance practices, including the sale of useless insurance on such items as fishing rods, ice chests and video tapes, would be insufficient. Furthermore, in light of Citigroup's recent statements (including those quoted infra) attempting to justify CitiFinancial employees signing documents for customers (in ICP's experience, often without the customers' knowledge or consent), the alluded-to \"reforms\" should be fully inquired into, with a skeptical eye. Comment must be allowed thereon; the comment period should be extended and, on the current record, the FRB could not legitimately consider approving Citigroup's applications.\nICP has received a heavily-redacted copy of Citigroup's September 6, 2002, Supplemental Response to the FRB's questions of August 16, 2002. As set forth below, this Citigroup submission contains misstatements and is contradicted by the exhibits ICP has timely submitted in this proceeding. For example, the FRB's Question 11 of August 16, 2002, was directly related to predatory lending issues timely documented by ICP in this proceeding:\nFRB Question 11: The information in Item 1 of Citigroup's submission dated July 29, 2002 and items 14 and 15 of the July 17 Submission appears to be somewhat contradictory. To avoid any possible misunderstandings, please provide the total number of improper disclosures or instances of improper disclosures (including, but not limited to, untimely disclosures, failures to make disclosures, and inappropriate disclosures) related to the sale of credit insurance, protection plans, and other similar products at CitiFinancial branches that were identified in 2001 and the first six months of 2002 through audits and any other form of internal or external review. Also, provide the total number of instances in which CitiFinancial personnel were discovered, through internal or external audits or other means during 2001 and the first six months of 2002, to have provided inaccurate or false information about a customer for purposes of insurance, protection plan, or other similar product qualifications.\nICP note: the record before the FRB includes cases whether, for example, an individual who'd had a heart attack the previous year was nevertheless sold credit life insurance; the CitiFinancial loan officer said \"don't worry about it\" and checked the No Pre-existing Condition\" box on the form. See below, regarding different colors of ink on the forms.\nDo not limit"}
{"text":" the response to 'branches that failed audits,' as in items 14 and 15 of the July 17 Submission. Citigroup's responses should identify the total number of branches that were found in the audits... to have any of the following occurrences: (1) failure to obtain the customer's consent prior to including insurance products in the loan documents\nICP note: in response, Citigroup states that \"It would be a violation of CitiFinancial policies and procedures for CitiFinancial personnel to present loan documents at closing with insurance or protection plan products and premiums included in the loan payment calculation without the customer's consent to purchase and-or finance the insurance or protection plan products.\"\nBut the CitiFinancial script ICP submitted as its Exhibit 7.3 shows that this -- insurance without consent -- is CitiFinancial's policy, at least on all non-real estate loans. Specifically, ICP Exhibit 7.3 shows that CitiFinancial tells its employees, as \"Ideas for Improving Sales,\" to \"Ask 'What kind of payment do you feel comfortable with?' Then develop a protected loan to fit the need. THIS ONE PHRASE WILL IMPROVE SALES ENORMOUSLY.\"\nThus Citigroup's above-quoted September 6, 2002, statement about its \"policies and procedures\" is not credible. In response to\n(2) failure to inform the borrower during negotiation that purchase of insurance and similar products is optional\nCitigroup writes \"TEXT REDACTED.\" ICP has today formally contested, under FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules, that and other Citigroup redactions and withholdings. In response to:\n(3) the optional nature of the product was not otherwise disclosed before and\/or at closing;\nCitigroup also writes \"TEXT REDACTED.\" ICP is contesting that and other redactions. In response to:\n(4) the branch failed to rerun, or retract and rebook, a loan without insurance or similar product when the borrower elected not to have insurance at closing;\nALL Citigroup writes is \"TEXT REDACTED.\" ICP is contesting that and other redactions. In response to:\n(5) insurance documents were prepared by an employee rather than by the borrower;\nCitigroup writes \"TEXT REDACTED,\" followed by \"[t]hese exceptions do not imply that employees completed documents without the customer's consent. CitiFinancial's policies and procedures do not permit employees to complete documents for the customer, and identifying exceptions to these policies and procedures is an audit device used to identify the areas in which CitiFinancial should focus its management and training resources. The fact that an employee may have physically completed a form for the customer, while an audit exception, does not imply that the respective document was not reviewed and approved by the customer.\"\nICP has described in detail various CitiFinancial loans, including one in which a CitiFinancial employee checked \"no pre-existing condition\" for a co-applicant who had, and disclosed, a heart attack in the last year. Specifically, ICP's initial June 3, 2002, Comment stated: \"Customer Loretta Jones and her husband applied for a loan through a CitiFinancial office in Knoxville. Mr. Jones was and is being treated for a heart condition. The insurance form requires an answer regarding pre-existing health conditions. The Jones' were told to leave this blank, and were charged for insurance, rolled into the loan. When they sought a copy of the final version of their documents, they found that CitiFinancial had subsequently checked the box, 'no heart condition,' and sent the form to American Health & Life. Inquiries were made, but no actions were taken.\" Citigroup's answers are not credible. In response to\n(6) credit disability questions were answered in different color ink than that used by the borrowers to sign their names;\nCitigroup writes \"TEXT REDACTED,\" followed by \"As with the prohibition on completing documents for the customer, monitoring the use of different colors of ink on a document is an audit device for CitiFinancial to determine where to focus its management and training resources. Given the large number of documents that must be signed at a closing and the fact that there may be two customers signing on the loan, it is understandable (albeit an audit exception) that customers may fill out or sign documents with more than one pen. This does not imply that employees completed the loan documents, much less that they did so without the customer's consent.\" ICP contests the redaction (and Citigroup's above-quoted statements). In response to\n(7) personal property insurance was placed on unacceptable collateral;\nALL Citigroup writes is \"TEXT REDACTED.\" ICP has documented, for example, CitiFinancial hard-selling insurance on fishing rods, leaf blowers, and video tapes, and then doubling the listed value of the items in order to sell more insurance. See, e.g., ICP's timely Ex"}
{"text":"hibits 12 and 13. This is a key issue -- the FRB cannot allow Citigroup to withhold the entirety of its response on this issue. In response to\n(8) insurance or similar product enrollment \/ authorization forms were unsigned by the borrower;\nCitigroup writes \"TEXT REDACTED,\" and then states \" Although insurance enrollment \/ authorization forms are expected to be signed by the customer, in view of the large number of documents to be executed at closing, it is understandable (albeit an audit exception) that in some cases a document may not be signed or may later be misplaced. In most if not all cases, the customer has signed one or more other documents indicating the customer's desire to take insurance...\". ICP contests this redaction (and Citigroup's above-quoted statements). In response to\n(9) the branch failed to process a cancellation of an insurance or similar product\nCitigroup redacts an entire page, its entire response. ICP contests this and other Citigroup redactions. In light of Citigroup's disingenuous and overbroad requests for Confidential Treatment, all improperly withheld documents should be released forthwith, and comment thereon allowed. On the current record, the FRB could not legitimately consider Citigroup's applications, other than for denial.\nICP has also renewed its request for all records reflecting any FRS personnel's communications regarding the application of CitiFinancial, whether intra-agency or with the above-captioned companies regarding the proposal, all comments received on the proposal (on an ongoing basis), and other records in the FRS' possession related to the proposal.\nThe FRB should note, for the record, the Dallas Morning News of September 13, 2002 (\"Predatory Lending Document Could Target CitiFinancial\"), which reports:\nA proposed $200 million settlement in a predatory lending lawsuit against Citigroup Inc. has been characterized as a preacquisition deal that traces back to practices at The Associates First Capital Corp. The Associates, a Dallas-based subprime lender, was acquired in a $27 billion deal in November 2000. These \"problems were related to a company before we acquired it,\" said Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford I. Weill in a statement on Friday. But at least one affidavit filed in the Federal Trade Commission case specifically slams practices at CitiFinancial with no mention of the Associates. Gail Kubiniec, who has never worked for The Associates, charged in her July 2001 affidavit that CitiFinancial employees were under pressure to \"pack\" insurance with their loans. \"I and other employees would often determine how much insurance could be sold to a borrower based on the borrower's occupation, race, age and education level,\" said Kubiniec, a former CitiFinancial employee, in the affidavit. \"If someone appeared uneducated, inarticulate, was a minority, or was particularly old or young, I would try to include all the coverages CitiFinancial offered. The more gullible the consumer appeared, the more coverages I would try to include in the loan.\"\nCitigroup refused to comment on the specifics of the affidavit. \"We are in active litigation, and I have to decline to comment on anything related to the suit or to the settlement,\" said Christina Pretto, a Citigroup spokeswoman. In a second affidavit filed in February 2002, Michele V. Handzel, an Associates employee who went on to work at a CitiFinancial branch, said this: \"CitiFinancial put much more pressure on employees than the Associates did to include as many credit insurance and ancillary products as possible on every loan. In fact, I feel that the credit insurance sales practices at CitiFinancial were worse than at The Associates.\" The FTC charged in March 2001 that the Associates lured consumers to refinance existing debts into home loans with higher interest rates and fees and that it packed optional fees to inflate the cost of loans. Community group leaders across the country are now pointing to these affidavits and saying that the predatory lending case and settlement should go beyond The Associates to include an examination of practices at CitiFinancial today.\n\"The moment the FTC filed an affidavit by an individual who was not even with the Associates, the case was expanded,\" said Matthew Lee, executive director of Fair Finance Watch at Inner City Press in New York. \"If the case was only about the Associates, that affidavit (from Kubiniec) would not be relevant.\"\nThe record before the FRB cries out for a full inquiry into CitiFinancial's current practices, including those documented by the exhibits ICP has submitted. Whatever new \"reforms\" Citigroup may be announcing must be made available to the public, and comment allowed thereon. On the current record, the FRB could not legitimately consider approving Citigroup's applications.\nThis is also true in light of the scandals that continue to gather force around Citigroup, which provide a separate basis for both the (still-) requested hearing and for the denial of this Citigroup expansion application"}
{"text":", under the BHC Act's managerial resources factor and otherwise. For the record, the Economist in an overview article of September 14, 2002 (\"Passing the Buck\") [snip]\nUpdate of September 9, 2002: on September 6, 2002, Citigroup's CEO announced that Citigroup is \"close\" to a settlement of the Federal Trade Commission's predatory lending lawsuit against it. The issue is addressed in a comment ICP filed with the Federal Reserve, OTS and FDIC on September 9, summarized below.\nRE: ICP's sixteenth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a sixteenth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nThe Washington Post of September 7, 2002, reported: \"'We are going to admit the things we did wrong,' Citigroup chief executive Sanford I. Weill said at a Merrill Lynch & Co. banking conference in New York yesterday. 'Nothing has come to anybody's attention that we have done anything illegal.'\" This followed a September 6 Wall Street Journal report that Citigroup is near settling the Federal Trade Commission's predatory lending lawsuit for $200 million. \"'When we acquired Associates about a year and a half ago, they had some problems with the FTC that related to what they did with insurance... and other things that were described as improper predatory lending, we have been working with the FTC,' Weill said. 'These problems basically related to a company before we acquired it,' he stressed.\" AFX, September 6, 2002. But \"Mr. Weill ducked out before questions.\" American Banker, September 9, 2002.\nICP wishes to first address in this comment the range of impacts that the predatory lending settlement discussed by Citigroup's CEO on September 6 should and might have on Citigroup's pending Golden State Bancorp applications. First, given the centrality of the predatory lending issues to this proceeding, the FRB should immediately inquire into the scope and timing of this reported settlement, and should await details of the settlement before considering this application for anything but denial. Even the FRB's ex-associate general counsel Oliver Ireland told the American Banker (September 9) that \"'if some regulator goes after [Citigroup] and they settle,' banking regulators could be'required to consider things related to the management of that function' when assessing a merger application.\" Emphasis added. We agree: these unresolved issues go directly to the factors that the FRB must consider and rule on in connection with this application.\nSecond, the FRB has before evidence of predatory practices at CitiFinancial that go beyond real estate lending, and beyond the practices of Associates First Capital when Citigroup acquired it. For example, ICP has submitted into the record CitiFinancial training scripts where employees are told to \"design [insurance] protected products\" without the customer having requested insurance; to request property lists for all loans to sell insurance thereon, including on items like fishing rods, ice chests and leaf blowers which the record reflects CitiFinancial does not foreclose on or repossess. These are predatory practices per se; ICP has urged the FRB to declare them \"unfair and deceptive practices\" under the authority confirmed by the FRB chairman in a letter to Congress earlier this year.\nThird, these issues go to not only the CRA \/ C&N and managerial factors, but also to the financial factor. The Guardian of September 5 quoted Prudential Financial's Citi-analyst that \"'Citigroup stands out relatively more for having all of these issues under one roof'... [A]ny successes achieved through lawsuits mounted for damages against Enron could cost Citigroup alone as much as $10 billion.\"\nCitigroup's responses to the FRB's 21 questions of August 16 were due on August 28; Citigroup was directed to send a copy to commenters and make its requests for confidential treatment, if any, at that time. On September 3, Citigroup mailed out copies of a so-called \"public redacted version\" of a response it apparently submitted to the FRB on August 28. In the text of this document, Citigroup refers to numerous purportedly \"Confidential\" exhibits, and redacts whole paragraphs and pages of text. ICP is contesting Citigroup's withholdings and requests for confidential treatment, including in a FOIA request \/ appeal submitted today.\nOn page 1 of Citigroup's Response to FRB's Questions dated August 16, 2002 (hereinbelow, the \"Resp.\""}
{"text":"), Citigroup refers to \"Confidential\" Exhibit YY in response to FRB Question 2. This exhibit by the terms of the question contains information about lending in 2000 and 2001, HMDA data for which is public. Accordingly, it is illegitimate to withhold the entire exhibit. The same applies to \"Confidential Exhibits\" ZZ and AAA. ICP also contests the redactions on page 4, regarding the number of CitiFinancial real estate loans with single premium insurance and pre-computed loans as of year-end 2001 and as of June 30, 2002.\nFRB Question 6 concerns CitiFinancial's practice of compensating employees based on how much insurance they sell. In response, Citigroup redacts the entirety of page 6 of its response; ICP contests the redaction (and the other redactions on page 7, and the redactions on page 9 concerning audits triggers by insurance cancellations.\nICP again contests the withholding of \"Confidential\" Exhibits OO, PP and RR: sales training materials which, if Citigroup's response is complete, include scripts which ICP has already obtained and made public. It is illegitimate to request confidential treatment for documents that are already public. If Citigroup's submissions differ from, or omit, the scripts ICP has submitted, that is significant as well. The Exhibits must be released.\nICP contests the withholding of \"Confidential\" Exhibit DDD, regarding insurance disclosures at closing. ICP contests the withholding of \"Confidential\" Exhibit EEE, regarding the states in which CitiFinancial sells Real Estate Home & Auto Security Plans, and the redactions on pages 11-12, regarding the number of Plans sold.\nICP notes that Citigroup's Resp. did not respond to FRB question 11 (the Resp. states, \"to be provided by amendment\") -- this \"amendment\" must be provided to ICP and other commenters, and comment allowed thereon. ICP contests the redactions on pages 15-16 regarding CitiFinancial's sham \"Mystery Shopping.\" ICP contests the withholding of \"Confidential\" Exhibit HH, regarding the valuation of personal property on which CitiFinancial sells insurance (the property, as demonstrated by ICP's exhibits, including such items as fishing rods, ice chests, and random video tapes). ICP also contests the withholding of the intervening \"Confidential\" Exhibits, FFF and GGG. ICP contests the redactions on pages 17-20 (regarding \"Referral Up\"), and those to page 18-19 regarding \"Conforming Product Pilot,\" etc.. ICP contests the redactions to pages 29-35, regarding Citigroup's lending including in 2001 (for which HMDA data is already public, see supra). ICP contests the redactions to page 38, regarding branch closures that would result from this proposal, if it were (as it should not be) approved.\nIn light of Citigroup's late-provision of copies of its submissions, and its disingenuous and overbroad requests for Confidential Treatment, all improperly withheld documents should be released forthwith, and comment thereon allowed. On the current record, the FRB could not legitimately consider Citigroup's applications, other than for denial.\nICP's continuing analysis of the recently-released 2001 HMDA data reveals that Citigroup's prime mortgage lending is more disparate than others in the industry. In the Baltimore MSA in 2001, cumulating Citibank FSB and CitiMortgage (hereinbelow \"Citi-Prime\"), Citi-Prime denied the conventional home purchase applications of African Americans 14.69 more frequently than whites, and denied Latinos 22 times more frequently than whites: wildly more disparate that the industry aggregate's denial rate disparities in the Baltimore MSA (3.16 for African Americans and 2.36 for Latinos).

(along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nWhile we continue to await the \"eight linear feet of documents\" that the FRB is withholding regarding its examination of CitiFinancial, we will focus in this submission on (1) CitiFinancial loans at over 40% interest, packed with insurance; the intentionally limited nature of CitiFinancial's \"Referral-Up\" program; and certain of the FRB's August 16 Additional Information (\"AI\") questions; (2) Citigroup's disparate prime lending in 2001 in Newark, New Jersey and Washington DC; and (3) the still-expanding scandals in which Citigroup finds itself, including yet another House of Representatives subpoena (this time concerning IPO stakes and artificially favorable research recommendations given to corporate executives to procure investment banking business for SSB), and the implications of Citigroup's dealings with Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing et al. on the managerial, compliance and financial factors that must be reviewed in connection with this Citigroup expansion application.\nICP has received a copy of the FRB's AI letter dated August 16, posing 21 questions to Citigroup. Citigroup's responses were due on August 28; Citigroup was directed to send a copy to commenters and make its requests for confidential treatment, if any, at that time. On August 30, ICP telephoned FRB staff and was told that Citigroup would not be providing a \"public\" copy of its response until September 3. Given the nexus between several of the FRB's August 16 questions and the evidence ICP has submitted, ICP intends to comment on Citigroup's response upon receipt, and contends that the FRB could not legitimately consider Citigroup's application, other than for denial, until Citigroup belated provides its responses to ICP and other commenters..\n(1) Annexed hereto as Exhibit 15.1 is documentation of a loan at a 40.45% interest rate which CitiFinancial made earlier this year. The customer -- who CitiFinancial states has a monthly income of $861 (that is, $10,000 a year) -- is also paying for credit life insurance and \"property insurance\" on the collateral that CitiFinancial listed as securing this loan. Given the customer's stated income, this is \"hard lending\" -- little different than a pawnshop.\nAnnexed hereto as Exhibit 15.2 is an internal CitiFinancial document regarding \"post date checks,\" stating that \"[a]s we discussed last month, about half of you need to do a much better job in securing postdated checks.\"\nAnnexed hereto as Exhibit 15.3 is another internal CitiFinancial document, this one describing to employees the \"Rate Reduction Plus\" plan that Citigroup has presented to the FRB and other regulators. At page 2, in the nature of \"don't worry about it,\" CitiFinancial tells its employees that \"[t]his special CitiMortgage mailing included about 8000 CitiFinancial customer names, that's an average of only 4 accounts per branch.\" Another reason not to worry: \"customers must meet strict credit criteria in order to be eligible for an invitation. This credit criteria [sic] (the same as the pilot Referral-Up program) is defined as follows... LTV of 75% or less LTV at the time of the loan... Loan on books for a minimum of 12 months.\"\nWith these limitations, CitiFinancial employees (who are paid based on who much they gouge customers) are told not to worry about the window-dressing of the Rate Reduction (and Referral-Up) programs.\nCitiFinancial's reforms to date have been less than meaningful, and have not even applied by their terms to CitiFinancial's non-real estate lending, in which single premium insurance is still sold, and insurance is sold on such items as leaf blowers and random video tapes. CitiFinancial is a predatory lender.\nWhile ICP awaits receipt of Citigroup's overdue responses to the FRB's August 16 AI letter, ICP wishes to highlight and add to the following FRB questions, as annotated below:\nFRB Question 11 [of 8\/16\/02]: The information in Item 1 of Citigroup's submission dated July 29, 2002 and items 14 and 15 of the July 17 Submission appears to be somewhat contradictory. To avoid any possible misunderstandings, please provide the total"}
{"text":" number of improper disclosures or instances of improper disclosures (including, but not limited to, untimely disclosures, failures to make disclosures, and inappropriate disclosures) related to the sale of credit insurance, protection plans, and other similar products at CitiFinancial branches that were identified in 2001 and the first six months of 2002 through audits and any other form of internal or external review. Also, provide the total number of instances in which CitiFinancial personnel were discovered, through internal or external audits or other means during 2001 and the first six months of 2002, to have provided inaccurate or false information about a customer for purposes of insurance, protection plan, or other similar product qualifications.\nICP note: the record before the Fed includes cases whether, for example, an individual who'd had a heart attack the previous year was nevertheless sold credit life insurance; the CitiFinancial loan officer said \"don't worry about it\" and checked the No Pre-existing Condition\" box on the form. See below, regarding different colors of ink on the forms.\nDo not limit the response to 'branches that failed audits,' as in items 14 and 15 of the July 17 Submission. Citigroup's responses should identify the total number of branches that were found in the audits... to have any of the following occurrences: (1) failure to obtain the customer's consent prior to including insurance products in the loan documents;\nICP note: the CitiFinancial script ICP submitted shows that this -- insurance without consent -- is CitiFinancial's policy, at least on all non-real estate loans.\n(2) failure to inform the borrower during negotiation that purchase of insurance and similar products is optional; (3) the optional nature of the product was not otherwise disclosed before and\/or at closing; (4) the branch failed to rerun, or retract and rebook, a loan without insurance or similar product when the borrower elected not to have insurance at closing; (5) insurance documents were prepared by an employee rather than by the borrower;\nICP note: this happens on most of the health-related questions on the insurance forms.\n(6) credit disability questions were answered in different color ink than that used by the borrowers to sign their names; (7) personal property insurance was placed on unacceptable collateral;\nICP note: CitiFinancial directs its employees to obtain collateral lists for EVERY non-real estate loan, and to write property insurance on the items. The items ICP has documented include an ice chest, fishing rods, leaf blowers, an electric typewriter, and random video tapes. We assume that this is what the Fed means by \"unacceptable collateral\" -- but this type of collateral, regarding which CitiFinancial never records its interest and on which it rarely if ever forecloses, is clearly deemed \"acceptable\" by CitiFinancial.\n(8) insurance or similar product enrollment \/ authorization forms were unsigned by the borrower; and (9) the branch failed to process a cancellation of an insurance or similar product.\nFRB Question 6.b: In Item 6 of the July 17 submission, Citigroup indicated that insurance sales are part of Citigroup's ROC point system of assessing branch performance. Citigroup also indicated that Regional Managers are compensated, in part, based on the 'number of branches over ROC.' Please clarify what impact insurance sales at the branch level, directly or indirectly, has on a Regional Manager's compensation.\nICP note: We have been told that Regional Managers only receive their annual bonuses if at least half of their branches hit the \"Qualifying\" (in some cases, \"Superior\") level of insurance sales. ICP will be submitting further comments, but will await receipt of Citigroup's overdue responses to the FRB's August 16 questions.\n(2) ICP's continuing analysis of the recently-released 2001 HMDA data reveals that Citigroup's prime mortgage lending is more disparate than others in the industry. In the Newark, New Jersey MSA in 2001, cumulating Citibank FSB and CitiMortgage (hereinbelow \"Citi-Prime\"), Citi-Prime denied the conventional home purchase applications of African Americans 8.87 more frequently than whites, and denied Latinos 6.06 times more frequently than whites: significantly more disparate that the industry aggregate's denial rate disparities in the Newark MSA (3.38 for African Americans and 2.39 for Latinos).

I would then like the Manager to get involved with this loan and make a concerted effort to sell it up, if not over the phone then at the loan closing. There is just too much bonus money at stake not to get these numbers up!\"\nFor the record, \"$104\/000\" means at least $104 in insurance premiums for every $1,000 of loan.\nThe conclusion of this Exhibit 13.1 memo references another memo by Bill Davis, previously referenced in ICP's submissions and exhibits in this proceeding. Annexed hereto as Exhibit 13.2 is a memo from Bill Davis to all district and branch managers stating inter alia that:\n\"Many of these properties are a joke. You would not live in them...

This, of course, satisfied all compliance issues.\" Note again the sworn affidavit in the FTC case against Citigroup regarding CitiFinancial instructions to hide the mouse pads from examiners.\nThat the purported reforms Citigroup has announced since acquiring Associates are of only dubious benefit to consumer is demonstrated by Exhibit 13.4, annexed hereto.

In light of issues that have arisen, including a sworn statement by a CitiFinancial employee submitted in Federal Trade Commission v.

On August 5, ICP submitted a supplemental comment and additional exhibits to the Fed; the comment is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's eleventh comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is an eleventh comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nWhile we continue to await the FRB's needed clarification questions regarding Citi's July 17 response, and rulings on our challenges to Citigroup's overbroad requests for confidential treatment for its July 29 and July 17 submissions, under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") and the FRB's ex parte rules, a focus of this eleventh supplemental comment is on the ever-more widely reported systemic problems with Citigroup's management and oversight system, which call into question both Citigroup's \"managerial resources\" for its Golden State proposal, and its eligibility for continuing Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLB\") powers. See infra.\nFirst, however, we must note for the record certain inaccuracies and inappropriate withholdings in Citigroup's July 29 submission (hereinbelow, the \"Resp.\"). On page 1 of its Resp., Citigroup refers to \"Confidential\" Exhibit NN, \"Insurance Sales Policy.\" The FRB's July 23 Question 1 asked whether \"[d]uring any time in 2001 and 2002, have personnel at any of CitiFinancial's branches engaged in any of the following acts: (a) presented loan documents at closing with insurance or protection plan products and premiums included in the loan payment calculation without the customer's express agreement in advance of the closing to purchase and\/or finance the insurance or protection plan products...\".\nCitigroup responds that \"[e]ngaging in any of the acts listed in Item 1 would be a violation of CitiFinancial polices and procedures.\" Resp. at 1.\nBut ICP's Exhibit 7.3, an internal CitiFinancial document that is a script provided to employees, \"Ideas for Improving Sales,\" states at bullet point 2:\n\"Ask 'What kind of payment do you feel comfortable with?' Then develop a protected loan to fit the need. THIS ONE PHRASE WILL IMPROVE SALES ENORMOUSLY.\" (Capitalization in original).\nIf a CitiFinancial employee follows this CitiFinancial training document, the employee will routinely \"present[] loan documents at closing with insurance or protection plan products... without the customer's express agreement in advance of the closing\" -- the employees are being told to ask \"how much can you pay,\" and then design a product with insurance (which has not been requested.)\nSo on the one hand CitiFinancial tells its employees to include insurance in the loan documents without getting the customers consent; on the other hand Citigroup tells the Fed that such a practice would \"violate CitiFinancial policies and procedures.\"\nThe same CitiFinancial training document tells employees \"Don't over disclose. AN INDICATION THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT.\" An aside: ICP has been informed by a long-time CitiFinancial employee of a disciplinary meeting between a CitiFinancial branch manager who declined to force-place insurance on personal loans and a higher-up who shouted, \"You're not been paid to believe in the product -- you're being paid to sell it!\" And if the branch manager did not aggressively pack this insurance into loan, not only would they not receive a bonus, they would be fired (which subsequently took place.) ICP also contests the extensive redactions to pages 2 - 5 of the Resp., purportedly responding to FRB 7\/23 Question 1 about insurance sales.\nCitigroup attempts to conf"}
{"text":"ine the entirety of its response to FRB 7\/23 Question 2 (communications with state regulators) to \"Confidential\" Exhibit VV. No attempt was made to distinguish between communications that are already public and those that are not, nor to provide reasonably segregable portions of the latter. Citigroup's withholdings are in bad faith: the comment period must be extended, the documents provided and comment allowed thereon.\nICP contests Citigroup's redaction of what percent of its personal loans were \"secured\" by household goods or other items (page 5 of the Resp.) and the extensive redactions to page 5 - 10 responding to the FRB's questions about household goods, insurance, valuation and repossession. ICP has put into evidence a CitiFinancial document showing household goods, including hand tools and an electric typewriter, re-valued upwards by 100% simply to sell more insurance, and CitiFinancial instructions to employees to ask for property lists in every instance, and to presumptively sell insurance on such property, without the customers consent. Citigroup has requested, and ICP in a July 31 request under FOIA and the ex parte rules opposed, confidential treatment for \"Confidential\" Exhibit CC, purportedly addressing collateral and its valuation, and \"Confidential\" Exhibit EE, purportedly concerning CitiFinancial's filings of UCC liens on household goods. ICP has submitted a Maesto computer system print out of a loan that required reapproval after the customer declined insurance. Citigroup's Response is apparently to the contrary: ICP should be provided with the entirety of Citigroup's response, under FOIA, the ex parte rules and otherwise.\nRegarding CitiFinancial's \"heads-up\" of its \"mystery\" shopping -- on which ICP submitted a memo subsequently reported in the American Banker (6\/24\/02) and Wall Street Journal (7\/18\/02) -- Citigroup redacts the bottom of page 10, all of page 11, and half of page 12. ICP contests this (and notes that Barry Leeds Associates, identified as the tester on page 10, was quoted in the American Banker of June 24, 2002, as declining to \"comment on whether [Barry Leeds] was involved in the late-2000 mystery-shopping tests\").\nRegarding the \"Graduation Loan Program,\" Citigroup alludes in its response to \"Confidential\" Exhibits GG and HH, both of which ICP requests. ICP is also requesting \"Confidential\" Exhibit II and JJ (regarding CitiMortgage's prime loans), KK and LL (regarding the foreclosure review process about which Citigroup has made public claims), and the material redacted on page 23.\nPerhaps most outrageously, in response to the FRB's 7\/23 Question 11 regarding \"nondisparagement\" agreements -- which ICP has called gag orders -- Citigroup has redacted its entire response. ICP has commented that ex-CitiFinancial employees have been threatened with litigation for whistleblowing, that current employees have recently been browbeating about the release of internal CitiFinancial scripts that contradict Citigroup's representations to the FRB, etc.. In July 2001 Citigroup's spokeswoman Leah Johnson told reporters that\nOur severance agreements, like those of most companies, include a standard non-disparagement clause. Because of our desire to assure that our stringent standards of conduct are upheld, such clauses at CitiFinancial never apply to employees bringing any concerns about illegal or unethical activity they believe they have witnessed to the appropriate authorities inside and outside the company. -- see Reuters of 7\/27\/01\nNow Citigroup seeks across the board confidential treatment for its entire response on this issue. A sample CitiFinancial gag order is already public, as ICP put it into the record before the FRB. ICP contests the redaction in full of Citigroup's response to FRB 7\/23 Question 11, and the withholding of any exhibits referred to in the redacted text. ICP also contests the redactions on page 26 (re Banamex).\nFRB 7\/23 Question 16 asks for data on Citigroup's subprime lending in 2001 and 2002. Citigroup's response says only, \"See Confidential Exhibit UU.\" But 2001 LAR data is already public -- in fact, Citigroup's First \"Omnibus\" Response chided ICP for not using this 2001 data. Accordingly it is ludicrous to request confidential treatment for the entirety of Citigroup's response to FRB 7\/23 Question 16. Citigroup's requests for confidential treatment have been in bad faith; the comment period must be extended, the improperly withheld material provided and comment allowed thereon.\nCertain additional exhibits, and an indicative tale: Citigroup has previously claimed that, for example, the 7500 Club is not a CitiFinancial incentive program. Annexed hereto as Exhibit 11.1 is a document reflecting another de facto CitiFinancial incentive program: a contest to see"}
{"text":" which group of branches can sell the most personal loans and insurance policies. Employees pack insurance because they are told and compensated to do so; CitiFinancial must be held to account for this.\nIn light of ICP's previous timely comment regarding CitiFinancial customers lent to at 14.5% interest, then offering 10% interest as soon as they find a better deal (indicating the arbitrary nature of CitiFinancial's pricing), annexed hereto as Exhibit 11.2 is an internal \"Pricing Matrix\" regarding which the FRB should ask Citigroup questions (including, for example, whether customers are offered the lowest price to which the matrix entitles them: our experience is, \"no\").\nEarlier in this proceeding, Citigroup stated that after reviewing a loan described by ICP, an insurance premium was refunded. Citigroup has not identified the loan. Here's a recent tale: then-Branch (now District) Manager Robert Knight was responsible for a CitiFinancial loan in April 2002. The customer moved to cancel the credit insurance. There was a copy of the cancellation letter in the loan file, but CitiFinancial did not cancel the insurance. Finally in late June 2002 CitiFinancial cancelled the insurance but never refunded the customer over $300 that were due. The customer noticed all this in connection with paying off the CitiFinancial loan at the end of July 2002. No disciplinary action was taken -- in fact, the manager who closed the loan, Robert Knight has been promoted to district manager. See Exhibit 11.3 hereto, a CitiFinancial e-mail to \"District Managers\" including Robert Knight. Our point: CitiFinancial encourages employees to pack insurance; even when they are \"caught,\" nothing is done. This is contrary to Citigroup's CEO's previously quoted July 25, 2002, statement that \"If we find that anyone in our company has done anything wrong or fails to abide by our professional standards, we will take all appropriate actions swiftly.\" Note that, even as contrasted to the CitiFinancial South Carolina situations documented to the FRB in 2001, here, based on ICP's eight sets of exhibits, not a single disciplinary action has apparently been taken, despite \"mystery\" shopping tip-off memos, purportedly unauthorized incentive programs like \"the 7500 Club,\" at least one refunded insurance premium, and widely disseminated training scripts that totally contradict Citigroup's public statements (and statements to the FRB) about CitiFinancial, etc.. This application should be denied, on the grounds set forth above as well as those below...\nUpdate of August 1, 2002: Citigroup has turned in a response to the Federal Reserve's 18 questions of July 23, 2002. Citigroup has redacted and requested confidential treatment for the majority of its responses. Even the information left in the \"public version\" is, when compared to the CitiFinancial documents ICP has put into the record, blatantly inaccurate and misleading. Some examples:\nThe Fed's July 23 Question 1 asked whether \"[d]uring any time in 2001 and 2002, have personnel at any of CitiFinancial's branches engaged in any of the following acts: (a) presented loan documents at closing with insurance or protection plan products and premiums included in the loan payment calculation without the customer's express agreement in advance of the closing to purchase and\/or finance the insurance or protection plan products...\".\nCitigroup responds that \"[e]ngaging in any of the acts listed in Item 1 would be a violation of CitiFinancial polices and procedures.\"\nThe same CitiFinancial training document tells employees \"Don't over disclose.

No attempt was made to distinguish between communications that are already public and those that are not, nor to provide reasonably segregable portions of the latter. Citigroup's withholdings are in bad faith.\nICP has now contested to the Fed Citigroup's redaction of what percent of its personal loans were \"secured\" by household goods or other items, and the extensive redactions to page 5 - 10 responding to the Fed's questions about household goods, insurance, valuation and repossession."}

ICP has informed the Fed: the comment period must be extended, the improperly withheld material provided and comment allowed thereon.\nUpdate of July 29, 2002: While Citigroup's practices are now in the spotlight, from Congress to the regulators to the mainstream financial press, the Fed has yet to ask Citigroup about its involvement with Enron and WorldCom, in connection with Citigroup's Cal Fed application. ICP has submitted a July 29 comment inquiring into this and other matters. ICP's July 29 comment is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's tenth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a tenth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nWhile we continue to await receipt of Citigroup's full response to the FRB's July 3 Additional Information (\"AI\") questions, and Citi's response to the FRB's more recent July 23 AI questions (as well as the FRB's needed clarification questions regarding Citi's incomplete July 17 response), the focus of this interim supplemental comment is on the now widely reported systemic problems with Citigroup's management and oversight system, which call into question both Citigroup's \"manager"}
{"text":"ial resources\" for its Golden State proposal, and its eligibility for continuing Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLB\") powers.\n...Clearly, the FRB should obtain a copy of Citigroup's CEO's response and make it part of the record in this proceeding. In the FRB AI questions sent to ICP under the FRB's ex parte rules, NO questions have been asked about Enron, or WorldCom, or the other scandals how swirling around Citigroup. As recited in an FRB Legal Division e-mail of June 4, 2002, regarding this proceeding:\n\"Today, the Board received the first comment on this notice. The comment is from Inner City Press. Although I'm sure we all remember, this is to remind everyone that our internal processing of this notice is now subject to the Board's policy on ex parte communications with notificants. Given the high public profile of this deal it is particularly important that we adhere to proper procedures in this case at all time... Any communications with Citigroup on these matters should therefore be in writing, however inconvenient this may seem. If you feel that you absolutely, positively have to talk to Citigroup about a matter raised in a protest, please do not do so without someone from Board Legal on the phone. (Any oral ex parte discussions will have to be summarized in a memo that can be made public.)\"\nICP's very first comment on Citigroup's Golden State applications, dated June 3, 2002, raised Citigroup's involvement in the Enron scandal as grounds to deny Citi's application. This triggered the FRB's ex parte rules. While it is possible that the \"confidential questions\" alluded to in the FRB's July 23 AI letter concern these matters, it is illegitimate and contrary to public policy to withhold from the public all of the FRB's questions on these matters....\nFor the record, and in light of Fed Chairman Greenspan's letter earlier this year to Rep. LaFalce that the Fed has the power to deem particular practices unfair and deceptive, ICP hereby formally asks the FRB to deem these CitiFinancial practices unfair and deceptive.\nFrankly, the FRB's Citigroup-Golden State proceeding gets crazier, more arbitrary and overly applicant-friendly, all the time. While Citigroup has still not finished answering the FRB's questions of July 3, the FRB on July 24 wrote that the public comment period won't be extended. ICP hereby requests for that decision to be reconsidered, and that this request for reconsideration be presented forthwith to the Governors.\nIn previous FRB proceedings, when an applicant has, during the comment period, withheld from commenters information to which they are entitled, the comment period has been extended. This is consistent with the practice of the OCC, which extends comment periods when an applicant has made an inappropriate request for confidential treatment. Here, the FRB has still not ruled on Citigroup's absurdly-broad request for confidential treatment for its submission of July 17 (that is, within the comment period). Perhaps even more dispositive (and certainly more inexplicable), the list of litigation against CitiFinancial which Citigroup was supposed to submit in late June (that is, within even the initial comment period) was, in fact, only submitted on July 12 (still within the extended comment period). [FN: That the litigation list that Citigroup submitted on July 12 is explicitly dated June 21, 2002 -- and that the non-confidentiality of just such a list was already ruled on by the FRB in 2001 in a Citi proceeding -- makes its withholding until after the comment period closed as the more inexplicable and indefensible]. But, despite the directive in the FRB's first AI letter, Citigroup did not send this litigation list to commenters. It was mailed out by the FRB staff on July 19: one day after the comment period closed. In this light, the comment period must be extended (and see supra -- this should be presented to the Governors now).\nAgain we ask, where is this all going? It is up to the agencies, at this time. The agencies can either coddle Citigroup, allowing late and blatantly inaccurate responses but nevertheless closing comment periods, or they can do what the law requires.\nUpdate of July 24-25, 2002: the Federal Reserve Board has asked Citigroup eighteen more questions about its subprime lending and CRA record -- including, at last, detailed questions about insurance CitiFinancial sells on \"household goods\" such as ice chests and lawn mowers and leaf blowers, CitiFinancial's \"gag orders\" on its employees, its arrogant non-responses to and deception of state regulators, and its staged \"mystery\" shopping -- each of which has been documented into the record by ICP.\nThe Fed's July 23 Additional Information letter, which the Fed faxed to ICP after 5 p.m. on July 24, begins by stating: \""}
{"text":"Based upon a review of the record, the following additional information is needed. Your response dated July 17, 2002, to my letter of July 3 requesting additional information is still under review. Therefore, the information requested in this letter does not address any clarifications concerning the July 17 submission that may be needed....\". So there may and should be more questions forthcoming. Also, Citigroup has still not responded to some of the Fed's July 3 comments. The Fed gave Citigroup an extension -- while it remains silent on community groups' related requests for an extension of the comment period. Here are some of the Fed's July 23 questions, followed by brief citations to exhibits that ICP submitted into the record between July 3 and July 18:\n\"Identify the total number and percentage of CitiFinancial personal loans (not including sales finance, credit card or automobile purchase loans) in each of 2001 and the first six months of 2002 that were secured by household goods or other items, not including autos or real estate (collectively, 'household goods'). Explain in detail the following: (a) how loans collateralized or secured by household goods differ from unsecured personal loans, including but not limited to the differences in interest rates or other charges on the loans and the purposes or functions of the collateral; (b) how the CitiFinancial customer service representatives or other personnel determine which household goods are to be used as collateral and how information on possible collateral is obtained; (c) how personnel determine the value of household goods as collateral for personal loans; and (d) what training all CitiFinancial personnel receive in connection with such valuation of household goods. Provide copies of all CitiFinancial guidelines, policies, procedures, and training and sales \/ marketing materials related to collateral or security for personal loans and collateral valuation.\"\nNote: ICP's Exhibit 13 showed a CitiFinancial \"property list\" reflecting CitiFinancial taking a security interest in fishing rods and an ice chest, and selling insurance thereon. In terms of \"valuation,\" ICP's Exhibit 12 showed CitiFinancial, in connection with flipping a loan, \"re-valuing\" a sewing machine from $500 to $1,000, an electric typewriting from $150 to $200 and hand tools from $500 to $1000. The valuations were entirely arbitrary; the reason CitiFinancial takes property lists is to sell insurance thereon, see below.\n\"Provide the number and percentage of CitiFinancial's secured personal loans (not including sales finance or auto purchase loans), in each of 2001 and the first six months of 2002, for which CitiFinancial completed UCC filings in connection with the household goods serving as collateral for the loans. Also, provide the number of defaulted CitiFinancial loans during these time periods that resulted in CitiFinancial repossessing the household goods that secured or collateralized the loans. Explain in detail CitiFinancial's policy on repossession of such goods in the case of borrower default on the personal loan, and provide copies of all CitiFinancial's related policies and procedures.\"\nNOTE: Current and former CitiFinancial employees have told ICP that the only reason CitiFinancial takes property lists is to sell insurance on them. The Wall Street Journal of July 18 reported: [snip]\nICP commented to the Fed on July 18 about this just-quoted CitiFinancial statement, and on the underlying practice: \"Citigroup admits that its purpose in routinely and systematically obtaining (requiring) 'property lists' is not to secure the loans. It is clear to ICP, and numerous informed sources have confirmed, that the purpose is to sell credit insurance, that has no value to the customer, by Citigroup's own concession. Ajay Banga's statement that the purpose is 'to make the borrower more responsible for paying the loan back' is ludicrous, and a significant admission in light of the fact that CitiFinancial routinely and systematically sells (packs) insurance on these items (as ICP has documented, ice chests, fishing rods, CD collections, and, yes, leaf-blowers). These practices are beneath contempt; they are predatory; they require the denial of Citigroup's applications.\" ICP's timely comment of July 18, 2002.\n\"Discuss whether CitiFinancial requires property insurance (or a property protection plan) in connection with loans secured by household goods or autos securing personal loans (not including auto purchase loans). Whether or not such insurance or protection plan is required, explain in detail how the coverage amount of the insurance or protection plan is determined and how the coverage is priced.\"\nNOTE: ICP's Exhibit 7.3 is an internal CitiFinancial training document stating, among other things, that \"We are a secured lender. Ask for collateral. Update property lists on every loan. We can write PPI [insurance] on the total of payments.\" The document also instructs CitiFinancial employees: \"Don't over disclose.\"\n\"Provide copies of all versions of C"}
{"text":"itiFinancial employee contracts or other agreements with employees (at the beginning of employment, during employment, and on termination of employment) that contain non-disparagement clauses or other forms of nondisclosure provisions, which were used during any time in 2001 and 2002.\"\nNOTE: ICP has submitted to the Federal Reserve a copy of a non-disparagement agreement that CitiFinancial required employees to sign in June 2001 in order to obtain their final employment payment. This CitiFinancial contract, on which Citi late threatened to sue, at Paragraph 5 requires the employee to agree that he or she \"will not make any statements to any person regarding the Company and its agents of a derogatory nature or which disparage the reputation, business or integrity of the Company or any of the executives or employees of the Company.\" This was and is an outrageous provision and, as noted, employees who signed it were subsequently brow-beating by Citigroup's DC-based outside counsel, were asked about providing information to Inner City Press, and were threatened with a lawsuit for damages under the provision. How's that for (no) \"whistleblower\" protections?\n\"During any time in 2001 and 2002, have personnel at any of CitiFinancial's branches engaged in any of the following acts: (a) presented loan documents at closing with insurance or protection plan products and premiums included in the loan payment calculation without the customer's express agreement in advance of the closing to purchase and\/or finance the insurance or protection plan products; (b) told customers (before, during or after loan closing) that credit or protection plan insurance is required to obtain the loan; (c) failed to disclose (before, during or after loan closing) that the purchase of insurance or protection plan products is optional; (d) required that a loan be repriced and reapproved (loan amount and\/or other terms) when the customer declined (before or during loan closing) to purchase and\/or finance an insurance or protection plan?\"\nNOTE: ICP's Exhibit 4.2 is a print-out of CitiFinancial's \"Maestro\" computer system reciting that when the customer complained that he didn't want \"prop protection\" insurance, the CitiFinancial employee \"had to back off and when I did, it automatically... needed reapproval.\" The practices inquired into by the Fed's above-quoted question take place systemically throughout CitiFinancial, in large part due to the ROCopoly compensation scheme, which requires employees to hit \"qualifying\" levels of insurance sales to receive a bonus. District and Regional managers do not receive bonuses unless the offices under their control hit \"qualifying\" (or in some cases \"superior\") levels of insurance sales.\n\"Provide copies of all communications between CitiFinancial (or any of its affiliates) and state regulatory agencies or state attorney general offices (collectively'state officials') during 2001 and 2002 regarding any concerns or questions of the state officials about:\n(i) the lending and marketing practices of CitiFinancial, Primerica Financial Services (including its agents), Travelers Bank and Trust, fsb, or any of these entities' affiliates; or\n(ii) the sales of insurance or protection plan products by any of these entities or their affiliates in connection with the lending activities of any of these entities or their affiliates (including the activities of their personnel or agents).\"\nNOTE: ICP's Exhibit 6.5 is a chain of correspondence between the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, Consumer Insurance Services unit, in which CitiFinancial declined for three months to answer the state regulator's question, based on a consumer complaint, about credit life insurance sales practices.\n\"Provide updates for Citibank, N.A., New York, New York ('Citibank'), and Citibank (New York State), Pittsford, New York ('Citibank (NYS)'), on their community development lending, investment, and service activities since their most recent CRA performance evaluations...\"\nNOTE: Citigroup previously made a New York State lending commitment, required by the New York Banking Department to bring Citigroup's prime lending in \"majority-minority\" census tracts up to the level of other banks. Citigroup \"gamed\" this commitment by complying with a slew of small $1,000 loans which it called mortgages although it never filed a lien against the properties. Question: beyond the predatory lending issues, how credible is Citigroup's \"new\" California \/ Nevada lending commitment, announced after close of business on July 3, 2002?\nNOTE: It has come out in this proceeding that Citigroup's so-called \"Real Estate Lending Initiatives,\" which Citi presented to the Fed and other regulators and on which these regulators conditioned their previous Citi approvals, did NOT apply to all of CitiFinancial's real-estate loans. Citigroup's July 17 (partial) response to the Fed's July 3 questions admitted that two of the \"real estate"}
{"text":" lending reforms,\" prepayment penalty choice and Rate Reduction Plan, did NOT apply to EquityPlus real estate-secured loans... The CitiFinancial memo that ICP put into the record as ICP Exh. 3 informed CitiFinancial regional managers and branches that \"we will begin a Mystery Shopping Test in December and complete in January. This will happen in two ways -- Telephone: the test is do we service every customer consistently, i.e. do we quote the same rates, LTVs, etc.? Are we consistent? Branch visits: A minority and a caucasian will visit the same or separate branches and request an identical loan. The test is do we quote the same rate, LTV, etc. and de we give equal service to each?\" Emphasis added. Clearly, back-to-back visits by a \"minority and a caucasian\" [sic] requesting exactly the same loan is calculated to alert the CitiFinancial employees that this is a test, a process which will \"complete in January.\"\nCitigroup has variously gamed and\/or not complied with its previously announced \"reforms,\" which in any event only even purportedly applied to one part of CitiFinancial's subprime loans. Citigroup uses \"personal\" loans as an opportunity to require property lists, mis-value them and sell insurance on them, then \"upsell\" the customer into a high-rate home-secured loan that the customer never initially requested. The same process happens with CitiFinancial's sales finance loans; CitiFinancial employees' compensation rides on forced-placed (\"packed\") insurance, on upselling and otherwise gouging each customer to the maximum extent. Within CitiFinancial this is called \"maxing out,\" and employees who do not do so are penalized. Those employees who complain are terminated and\/or threatened with litigation. So what will happen now?\nThe Fed's letter concludes: \"Please respond to the confidential information request in the Confidential Exhibit attached. [ICP NOTE: Could it at least be re Enron and WorldCom? One would hope that the Fed is asking]. Please send an original and ten copies of your response... by no later than August 2, 2002.... In addition, please send a copy of the non-confidential portion of your response to the commenters... \"\nUpdate of July 22, 2002: On July 19, Citigroup provided ICP with a copy of its grandiosely entitled \"Second Omnibus Response.\" It blatantly dodged the issues; even so, it stated that \"[f]or personal loans, single premium credit insurance can be a valuable product, which many of Citigroup's customers choose to purchase.\" So, as ICP had previously shown, CitiFinancial continues selling single premium credit insurance -- on personal loans, with the same argument it made while defending the product with respect to real estate loans. These issues, combined with Citigroup's upcoming Enron testimony and the WorldCom-related lawsuit filed against Citi last week have led ICP to ask the Federal Reserve to strip Citigroup of its \"Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\" powers, or at least to curtail them as the Fed did last week with PNC. ICP's July 22 comment is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's ninth comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a ninth comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nOn Friday, July 19, after the stated expiration of the comment period, ICP received from Citigroup a copy of its \"Second Omnibus Response.\" Citigroup's \"First Omnibus,\" dated July 3, had stated at 18 that \"[a]dditional materials have been provided by Inner City Press in its filings dated June 24 and June 30, 2002... CitiFinancial is in the process of reviewing these materials in the same fashion it reviewed the earlier materials that have been... filed with the banking agencies. To date, it does not appear that any of the materials that have been received reflect violations of policy or law.\"\nAt the formal meeting on July 8, Citigroup's Marge Magner recited that \"with respect to allegations in various documents regarding individual borrowers... which are been published by one commenter, these allegations were subject to review... the review identified only one issue and corrective actions was taken. Additional materials have been provided more recently by the same commenter. CitiFinancial's in the process of reviewing those materials in the same fashion it reviewed the earlier ones"}
{"text":".\" Tr. at 210.\nMore than two weeks after Citigroup's \"First Omnibus,\" ten days after Ms. Magner's above-quoted statement, and more than three weeks after ICP timely submitted its June 24 exhibit -- Citigroup's Second and presumably final response says NOTHING about these exhibits. By Citigroup's own admission, previous ICP submission revealed violations (the specifics of which Citigroup has yet to disclose). In this light, Citigroup's blatant failure to address the exhibits to ICP's June 24 and 30 comments (and its July 15 and 18 comments) must be construed as an admission. On the current record, the agencies could not legitimately approve Citigroup's applications.\nOn Tuesday, July 23, four senior Citigroup officials have been required to testify before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: David C. Bushnell, managing director of \"global risk management\" at Citi's Salomon Smith Barney; James F. Reilly Jr., managing director of Salomon's global power and energy group; Richard Caplan, managing director of the Salomon's credit derivatives group; and Maureen Hendricks, a \"senior advisory director\" at Citi's Salomon in New York. See, e.g., American Banker of July 22, 2002. See also, N.Y. Times of July 18, 2002, at A1: \"a handful of top executives at telecommunications companies received big allotments of hot new stocks from Salomon Smith Barney, according to a former broker who has filed a lawsuit accusing the firm of unfair business practices,\" etc..\nFor the record, in light of these matters and the systemic predatory lending that has been documented, ICP is asserting that Citigroup Inc. is not \"well managed\" within the meaning of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and should be stripped of its powers as a financial holding company thereunder. At a minimum, the conditioned placed by the FRB on PNC Financial Services Group last week should be placed on Citigroup. [FN: In further support of this request: the New York Times of July 3, 2002, at A9, reported that Citigroup violated the rules of, and paid fines to, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control for violating sanctions on trade and investment].\nOn July 18, ICP was forced to respond in less than four hours to Citigroup's much-redacted Response to the FRB's Additional Information (\"AI\") questions of July 3, 2002. ICP now wishes to express particularly outrage (on the \"well managed\" issue) at Citigroup's attempts to withhold in full its responses to FRB Questions 27-29, which relate to delinquencies, \"curing\" delinquencies and to what ICP (and numerous CitiFinancial employees) have referred to as distortion of delinquency. In response to FRB Question 27, Citigroup leaves in only four words: \"See Confidential Exhibit U.\" For FRB Questions 28a-c, Citigroup says only that \"Responses to Items 28a-c are provided at Confidential Exhibit X.\" Half a page responsive to FRB Question 28d is redacted, followed by the statement that \"each RBO is also reviewed... Very few exceptions have been noted in past audits...\". Resp. at 29. But ICP's Exhibit 5.6, submitted on June 30 and as-yet unresponded to by Citigroup (see supra) showed that for a single sample CitiFinancial branch in a single month, over THIRTY exceptions were found. Systemic distortion of reported delinquencies at CitiFinancial is an issue that goes beyond predatory lending: it is an accounting issue and must be resolved and acted on in this proceeding.\nAn aside about audits: in the July 18 Wall St. Journal, Citigroup explains its firing of a former branch manager by stating that the individual \"was fired for failing branch audit reviews.\" Note for the record, as relates to the FRB's AI Questions and Citigroup's Responses, that this individual was awarded a rating of 4, on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the lowest. Note also that other CitiFinancial branch managers have been awarded the lowest rating, 5 -- and still remain in the employ of CitiFinancial, still interacting with customers and their loan documents and still, as acknowledged by Citigroup's Second Omnibus Response at 9, selling single premium credit insurance. [FN: Citigroup states that \"single premium credit insurance can be a valuable product\" -- but its Response to the FRB AI Letter stated that credit insurance is not sold in connection with Citigroup's (mostly) prime loans through CitiMortgage and Citibank].\nTo FRB Question 29, Citigroup's entire Response, more than a page, has been redacted, followed by the statement that \"[p]olicies and procedures for CFMC are included at Confidential Exhibit X.\" To FRB Question 30b, regarding"}
{"text":" \"under reporting delinquencies,\" Citigroup redacts the entirety of its response. This is illegitimate, particularly in light of the delinquency \/ accounting issues raised.\nThe FRB must forthwith review Citigroup's overbroad requests for confidential treatment for its responses to the FRB's AI Letter of July 3, in light of FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules; the FRB must release all non-exempt information and extend the comment period. Furthermore, actions such as those taken with respect to PNC last week, and more, should be taken forthwith.\nUpdate of July 19, 2002: Neat tricks of Citi -- after 5 p.m. on July 18 Inner City Press received a heavily redacted copy of Citigroup's response to the Federal Reserve Board's July 3 questions about subprime lending. The comment period was expiring, at least for now, at 6 p.m. PST (9 p.m. EST) on July 18. ICP reviewed Citigroup's response, which refers to 28 exhibits that are not provided, and to some future submission of further information about credit insurance, and timely put in the comment summarized below, to the Fed, OTS and FDIC. ICP also submitted a Freedom of Information Act request \/ appeal for the swaths of Citigroup's response that Citi's trying to withhold. Highlighted below is the fact that the mostly-prime rate CitiMortgage \"does not offer credit life, disability and unemployment or similar credit insurance products to customers at or prior to the time of loan closing.\" Resp. at 11. This Citigroup sentence made plain the separate but unequal system in use within Citigroup. To CitiFinancial customers (whose demographics notably skew more toward the classes protected under the fair lending laws than do those of Citibank or CitiMortgage, see below), Citigroup aggressively sells credit and personal property insurance, resulting in higher payments. Often the insurance is of no benefit to the customer, as ICP has shown (with respect to ice chests and fishing rods and leaf blowers in CitiFinancial's property lists, and see WSJ of July 18, 2002). One proof that these products are of limited benefit to customers is that Citigroup does not sell or offer any of them to its prime customers... Also, Citigroup claims that if its district managers come up with their own ways to \"incentivize\" predatory lending, these are not \"CitiFinancial\" practices (although they sure add to Citigroup's profits, like those reported earlier this week). The issue of systemic distortion of delinquency within CitiFinancial, which sure seems related to Congressional inquiries into accounting issues, was hardly addressed in Citigroup's response at all...\nRE: ICP's eighth timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is an eighth timely comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nAfter 5 p.m. today ICP received from the FRB a heavily-redacted copy of Citigroup's Response to July 3 FRB Additional Information (\"AI\") Letter. Citigroup is seeking to withholding more than two dozen responsive exhibits, and as set forth below has explicitly not complied with the FRB's July 3 request for \"needed\" information. ICP has today submitted a request \/ appeal for the improperly withheld information, including under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). The comment period must be extended until Citigroup files the \"amendment[s]\" reference in its Response and until the improperly (and frivolously, see infra) withheld information is released. On the current record, Citigroup's applications could not legitimately be approved.\nIn the absurdly limited time between receipt of the redacted Response and the current expiration of the comment period, ICP provides the following comments on those portions of Citigroup's Response which Citigroup has not withheld or redacted:\nCitigroup's Response to FRB Question 2b reveals that Citigroup's purported \"Real Estate Lending\" reforms have not been implemented on EquityPlus loans, which are without question \"Real Estate\" secured loans. (Citigroup acknowledges that it \"takes and records a mortgage on the borrower's property,\" Resp. at 2). Inter alia, these CitiFinancial real estate loans do not including \"prepayment penalty choice\" nor \"Rate Reduction Plan.\" Citigroup has misled the public and its regulators, including the FRB, regarding its so-called \"Real Estate Lending\" reforms, which the FRB"}
{"text":" relied on in its Citi-EAB and Citi-Banamex Orders.\nRegarding credit insurance sold (or packed) on its EquityPlus loans, Citigroup states that \"Information regarding loans that involved insurance sales will be provided by amendment.\" Resp. at 3. This is a central issue in this proceeding (including as reflected by the FRB's July 3 Question 2) -- the comment period must be extended until Citigroup responds to the July 3 AI letter, which stated that \"based on a review of the record, the following additional information is needed.\" Emphasis added. Also, ICP formally contests the withholding of \"Confidential Exhibit G\" (Resp. at 3), which concerns volumes of subprime EquityPlus loans.\nFRB Question 2d concerns these EquityPlus loans; Citigroup has sought to redact its entire response. Particularly in light of the issue of Citigroup have misled the FRB and the public, raised above, this new Citigroup representation must be released, and comment allowed thereon.\nFRB Question 3 concerned Citigroup's purported \"Mystery\" shopping. On June 3, ICP submitted an internal CitiFinancial memorandum which told employees that the \"mystery\" shopping would stop in January, and what was being tested for. Citigroup's Response dated July 17 baldly claims \"No advance notice\" (Resp. at 4), and then seeks confidential treatment for an \"internal announcement\" which would seem identical to ICP's already-public Exhibit 3. Once a document is public, there is no basis for seeking confidential treatment. If Citigroup's \"Confidential\" Exhibit I is different than ICP's Exh. 3, that's all the more reason to release it and allow comment thereon.\nICP has shown the systematic pressure within CitiFinancial to turn sales finance contracts into CitiFinancial loan, finally real estate loans, with packed credit insurance and additional fees at each step. FRB Question 4 is for factual information about each step in this process and Citigroup's only public response is \"See Confidential Exhibit J.\" This is both illegitimate (under FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules) and troubling. The information must be released and comment allowed thereon.\nFRB Question 5 concerns safeguards against loan flipping. ICP has introduced evidence about CitiFinancial's \"RBO\" (refinance balance only) practices, and has shown that a single sample CitiFinancial branch recorded over 30 flipping violations in a single month. See ICP Exh. 5.6. Citigroup's Response prattles on about supposed safeguards, refers to \"Confidential\" Exhibits K and BB, and then redacts the final portion of the Response. This is both illegitimate (under FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules) and troubling. The information must be released and comment allowed thereon.\nICP has submitted documentation of how Citigroup compensates CitiFinancial employees, under the ROCopoly \/ QuikPlan system which measures and provides bonus points for raw insurance sales volume, including on real estate loans. Most recently, ICP has submitted CitiFinancial training documents which instruct employees to track their insurance sales daily and not \"over disclose\" (see Exhibits to ICP's Seventh Comment). FRB Question 6 requests information about compensation for insurance sales. Citigroup has left in only a single sentence (\"There are two primary bonus programs for branch network employees, the Return on Cash program ('ROC') and ROCopoly\") and thereafter redacts two full pages of its Response. This is both illegitimate (under FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules) and troubling. ROCopoly is central to CitiFinancial: it is described in CitiFinancial's widely-available employee newsletter (see previous ICP exhibits, including ICP Exh. 6.4 (re Mike Knapp's RocoPoly Challenge); it is a take-off on the board game Monopoly; the system even includes a mock board, laminated and widely available in CitiFinancial branches, showing that credit and property insurance must be sold to hit \"qualifying\" levels. For the record, and in response to FRB Question 6, ICP has been informed that District Managers cannot get bonuses unless their branches hit \"qualifying\" levels of insurance sales. ICP has submitted documentation of what these \"qualifying\" levels are in various states. In many branches, the focus is only on the \"superior\" level. ICP has submitted documentation of how few insurance claims Citigroup actually pays out on (see Exhibits to ICP's Seventh Comment). Given the issues raised (and already public), the withholding of Citigroup's entire response on this issue is illegitimate and troubling. The information must be released and comment allowed thereon.\nFRB Question 7 concerns disclosures made regarding insurance. ICP has submitted the talking points Citigroup has distributed to employees, including to answer such customer statements as \"I do not want it\" and"}
{"text":" \"I can't afford it.\" Citigroup is now trying to provide scripts along with a request for confidential treatment. It is imperative that the talking points ICP timely submitted and the scripts Citigroup has late provided under confidential seal be compared.\nCitigroup's Response to FRB Question 7b (\"any characterization of a loan as 'fully protected') refers only to a Conversation Guideline \"used only in New York.\" But ICP's Exhibit have shown numerous CitiFinancial documents using the euphemism \"protection\" and \"protected\" for insurance. This Citigroup Response is misleading, incomplete, inaccurate -- appropriate actions including denial of Citigroup's applications should take place forthwith.\nCitigroup has yet to answer FRB Question 8, again regarding credit insurance. Citigroup states that \"this information will be provided by amendment.\" That is to say, Citigroup has two weeks and couldn't or wouldn't respond, but nevertheless wants the comment period to close and the \"expeditious\" approval referred to by Ms. Magner at the July 8 formal meeting. Clearly, the comment period must be extended. And a copy of Citigroup's late \/ \"amend[ed]\" response to FRB Question 7d should be provided directly to ICP and other commenters -- as, for example, Citigroup's other unilaterally delayed submission, of the litigation list requested in the FRB's first AI letter, still hasn't been, despite ICP's July 11 FOIA request.\nIndicatively, Citigroup is able to provide credit insurance information for its prime loans (FRB Question 9) but not for its subprime loans (FRB Question 8) -- and Citigroup states that the mostly-prime \"CitiMortgage does not offer credit life, disability and unemployment or similar credit insurance products to customers at or prior to the time of loan closing.\" Resp. at 11, emphasis added.\nThis Citigroup sentence made plain the separate but unequal system in use within Citigroup. To CitiFinancial customers (whose demographics notably skew more toward the classes protected under the fair lending laws than do those of Citibank or CitiMortgage, see ICP's previous timely HMDA analysis), Citigroup aggressively sells credit and personal property insurance, resulting in higher payments. Often the insurance is of no benefit to the customer, as ICP has shown (with respect to ice chests and fishing rods and leaf blowers in CitiFinancial's property lists, and see infra, WSJ of July 18, 2002). One proof that these products are of limited benefit to customers is that Citigroup does not sell or offer ANY OF THEM to its prime customers. Citigroup's various claims that these products benefit customers (claims turned into hard-sell in the internal CitiFinancial talking points ICP submitted among with its Seventh Comment) are called into question by the fact that Citigroup does not offer or sell the products to its prime customers. This is a crucial point, and separately and by itself calls for the denial of Citigroup's application and other enforcement actions, including under the fair lending laws...\nICP wishes to timely put into the record the following Wall Street Journal article of July 18, 2002: \"Efforts by Citigroup to Reform Subprime Unit Raise Questions,\" by Paul Beckett, which beyond the \"mystery shopping\" scam reports [snip]\nConsider for a moment the cynicism of this statement, and of the underlying practice: Citigroup admits that its purpose in routinely and systematically obtaining (requiring) \"property lists\" is not to secure the loans. It is clear to ICP, and numerous informed sources have confirmed, that the purpose is to sell credit insurance, that has no value to the customer, by Citigroup's own concession. Ajay Banga's statement that the purpose is \"to make the borrower more responsible for paying the loan back\" is ludicrous, and a significant admission in light of the fact that CitiFinancial routinely and systematically sells (packs) insurance on these items (as ICP has documented, ice chests, fishing rods, CD collections, and, yes, leaf-blowers). These practices are beneath contempt; they are predatory; they require the denial of Citigroup's applications.\nIn response to FRB Question 12, Citigroup admits that \"[t]he credit for a sale of insurance that a district or branch manager would otherwise received... is reversed if the customer cancels the insurance.\" Then Citigroup claims that there is no pressure on CitiFinancial customers not to cancel their insurance. ICP has put into evidence a memo announcing a CitiFinancial training explicit to prevent insurance cancellations. See ICP Exh. 5.3. Citigroup's response is not credible.\nThis is further demonstrated by Citigroup's response to FRB Question 13, regarding ROCopoly and \"the 7500 club,\" which was explicitly referenced in ICP Exh. 5.2, a CitiFinancial branch manager stating: \"Team, this is not the direction we need to"}
{"text":" be headed... Remember starting today we belong to the 7500 Club. You get it.\" Emphasis added.\nCitigroup states that \"[t]here is no 7500 Club... the 7500 Club is not (and has never been) a component of the CitiFinancial incentive compensation program.\" Resp. at 13.\nThis raises a central point: just because Citigroup and its counsel, or CitiFinancial headquarters in Baltimore, say that something doesn't exist or is not taking place -- does that make it so? A review of recent and current Congressional inquiries into corporate practices would say: no it does not. The focus here is on what CitiFinancial, through its branches, is actually doing. It is at this level that CitiFinancial customers are impacted, not with the pie-in-the-sky whitewash emanating from CitiFinancial in Baltimore, Citigroup in New York or its counsel in DC. Citigroup's July 17 claim that \"the 7500 Club is not (and has never been) a component of the CitiFinancial incentive compensation program\" (emphasis added) flies in the face of actual documented practices. The point is broader than the 7500 Club (the statement \"you get it\" is particularly evocative of the sub silencio nature of how things really work at CitiFinancial) -- ICP has submitted CitiFinancial documents reflecting other \"carrot-and-stick\" programs, such as enforced overtime through \"Blitz Nights,\" competitions to sell the highest number of loans and the most credit insurance, with the winners getting a free lunch or, in and around Knoxville TN, a trip to \"Dollywood,\" etc.. Citigroup claims that none of these things exist but that is simply not the case.\nICP contends that Citigroup and CitiFinancial are presumptively aware of these practices, profit from them, but seek to retain plausible deniability for regulatory review such as these FRB AI Question and the still-not-addressed examination of CitiFinancial upon which the FRB conditioned its Citi-EAB approval in mid-2001. There is sworn testimony (most recently referenced in the WSJ of July 18, 2002, see supra) that CitiFinancial employees have been ordered to hide documents from \"banking\" examiners. It is imperative that the exam be completed and made public, that Citigroup be required to disclose and cancel gag orders of the kind ICP documented in the Citi - EAB \/ Banamex proceedings, and that a public hearing be held. To do less, including to either uphold Citigroup's frivolous and overbroad requests for confidential treatment, or release the data when no comment thereon is allowed, would be dereliction of duty on the agencies' part.\nInteresting, Citigroup further tries to spin the \"7500 Club\" by stating that \"[r]eference to the 7500 Club likely comes from a handwritten note by a District Manager on a document that was disseminated to certain branches in Tennessee.\" See ICP Exh. 5.3; note that this incentive program (\"you get it\") is de facto in force at CitiFinancial branches that impact customers -- and that, even if one were to accept Citigroup's spin, no disciplinary action has been taken regarding these purportedly unauthorized additional incentive programs (which, we note, provide profit to Citigroup such as those announced on July 17, 2002).\nIn the dwindling time remaining in the current comment period, this is an opportune point to discuss CitiFinancial's duplicitous public responses to compliance problems that come to light. As the FRB knows, in mid-2001 ICP documented extensive (and similar) problems at CitiFinancial in South Carolina. Citigroup publicly dismissed these issues, blamed them on disgruntled ex-employees, and sent employees of its outside counsel to South Carolina (see previously cited Reuters article) to threat to sue certain ex-employees if they provide any further information or otherwise \"disparaged\" Citigroup. Subsequently Citigroup acknowledged that it terminated a supervisory employee in South Carolina (see previously cited American Banker article). But the problems documented went well beyond the employee-level to which Citigroup limited its belated disciplinary action, and were caused by higher-ups still in Citigroup's employ.\nWhile Citigroup was publicly denying that the allegations had any merit, CitiFinancial a July 24, 2001, \"cover-your-a**\" memorandum from Mike Knapp, Harry Goff and Jerry Bayless to \"CitiFinancial Employees,\" stating inter alia that \"[o]ver the past several weeks, two former employees have come forward with allegations that they participated in or witnessed behavior that is in clear violation of our policies and procedures... Your management will soon be contacting you to discuss these issues in greater detail...\". See ICP Exh. 8.2, annexed hereto. Given that Citigroup's \"review[]\" of the matter included threats to sue on life-long non-dis"}
{"text":"paragement clauses, one can only imagine what these subsequent \"management\" contacts involved. In this proceeding, ICP has asserted that Citigroup's \"review\" has included the brow-beating of employees at the Morristown, Tennessee CitiFinancial branch, with a focus on who gave Inner City Press the documents, and not on the underlying practices the documents reflect. The branch manager who said, of the 7500 Club, that \"you get it\" was at the Morristown branch on both July 8 and 9, simultaneous with Ms. Magner's canned testimony and rebuttal at the formal meeting. An inquiry into these matters is required.\nSince today's Wall Street Journal reports in some detail on another ex-CitiFinancial employee, ICP feels compelled to amplify that now-public account. We note that it is another, though different, case of Citigroup suing (in this case pursuing criminal charges) against a whistleblowing former employee. The WSJ's reference to an 18-year old unrelated criminal matter was dug up, as \"dirt,\" by Citigroup's public relations department itself. The message to other potential whistleblowers is clear: speak out against our practices and we will find any dirt in your background, no matter how old, and provide it to the press. Citigroup's fancy talk about whistleblower protections is just that, talk. Citi threatened to sue South Carolina whistleblowers, has pursued a criminal complaint (and dug up 18 year old dirt) on a Tennessee whistleblower and has brow-beat and intimidated its own employees in close nexus with this FRB, OTS and FDIC proceeding. Additionally, regarding today's WSJ article, CitiFinancial has explicitly sought to track and prevent \"pay off\" requests they believe are attributable to this ex-employee, whether or not the customers would be getting a better deal, a lower rate, less abusive credit insurance, etc.. Annexed hereto as Exhibit 8.1 are memoranda from two separate CitiFinancial district managers requesting \"a copy of all payoff requests that you have received\" from the individual and \"asking for your help to stop this bleeding of our accounts.\" ICP has been informed, here and elsewhere, that CitiFinancial tries to discourage or make impossible its customers refinancing to more favorable loans by ignoring payoff requests, intentionally misplacing them and even by racking up credit bureau inquiries on prospective pay-off prospects so as to drive their FICO scores down and make the new loan impossible. ICP is aware of just such a recent case; it is related to one of the cases of brow-beating and intimidation (this time of a customer, not an employee) that ICP has timely recounted into the record in this proceeding.\nWhere is this all going? It is up to the agencies, at this time. The agencies can either coddle Citigroup, allowing late and blatantly inaccurate responses but nevertheless closing comment periods, or they can do what the law requires.\nUpdate of July 18, 2002: While Citigroup's responses to the Federal Reserve Board's below-quoted questions, which largely tracked the exhibits Inner City Press \/ Fair Finance Watch has submitted, were due on July 18, with the comment periods expiring July 18, on July 17 ICP learned that the Fed had given Citi an extension such that its responses wouldn't be received during the comment period. ICP has submitted an additional timely comment, asking for an extension of the comment period, and putting into the record six more exhibits: scripts for hard-selling credit insurance, including directives to not \"over disclose\" and to take \"property lists\" for every loan and to sell insurance on all of it. The comment is summarized below.\nRE: ICP's seventh timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a seventh timely comment opposing and requesting and extension of the comment period and hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nAs you know, ICP submitted detailed comments, with multiple CitiFinancial exhibits, on June 3, 10, 24 and 30, and July 15, 2002. On July 3, the FRB asked Citigroup 34 questions, many of which appear related to exhibits ICP submitted on June 3 and thereafter. By the terms of the FRB's Additional Information letter, Citigroup's Response was due on July 17: prior to the current expiration of the comment period. ICP anticipated receiving Citigroup's Response and commenting thereon, particularly since Citigroup has yet to respond to ICP's comments and exhibits submitted as far back as June 24"}
{"text":", three and half weeks before the expiration of the comment period. See Citigroup's July 3 submission and Ms. Magner's purported rebuttal statement in the Transcript of the July 8 formal meeting.\nAt 5:30 p.m. on July 17 I learned that the FRB has decided to grant Citigroup an extension of time to file its Response to the July 3 Additional Information letter. [FN: While this extension was explained with reference to new post-9\/11 screening procedures at the Board, Citigroup knew of these procedures. If Citigroup gets an extension, so too must the commenters. ICP in particular requests an extension, in light of Citigroup's failure to timely respond to June 24 (and 30) exhibits, and the nexus between the exhibits ICP has submitted and the July 3 Additional Information letter]. Accordingly in this comment, which is timely, ICP is requesting an extension of the comment period so as to be able to receive, review and comment on Citigroup's Response to the Additional Information letter which concerns CRA and subprime lending.\nIn the interim, ICP submits the attached additional exhibits, which further demonstrate CitiFinancial's predatory lending and insurance sales practices:\n-- Exhibit 7.1 hereto is an internal CitiFinancial documents headed, \"Questions to Ask During the Application.\" It suggests ways to elicit information from an applicant, often unrelated to the loan being applied for, in order to sell more insurance. Question 5, for example, directs employees to ask \"What kind of car do you drive? And your wife\/husband? Does your family have any other cars, vans, RVs in your name? How about any boats (under 22 feet)?\" As ICP has previously documented, Citigroup seeks \"collateral\" for non-real estate loans primarily in order to sell insurance. This script ends with the statement \"THEN you are going to be ready to USE THE MOUSEPAD!!\". As the FRB will remember, in the pending FTC predatory lending litigation against Citigroup, a CitiFinancial employee has asserts that she was directed to hide just such \"mouse pads\" from the banking regulators.\nExhibit 7.2 hereto is an even more specific script, suggesting questions for \"during the application: just ask questions\" and for the \"Approval Stage.\" During the application, CitiFinancial employees are to ask, in cross-examination form, \"You are carrying Liability Only coverage on those vehicles? Is that right?\" Then at the \"Approval Stage,\" the question is repeated, followed by \"We require that the vehicle have comprehensive physical damage coverage... You can buy ours. We have an excellent policy... and we can include it right in the loan payment for you. Would you like us to take care of that for you?\" Emphasis added.\nExhibit 7.3, \"Ideas for Improving Sales,\" instructs as bullet point 1 to \"[s]top talking beyond the sale (Don't over disclose).\" Emphasis added. FRB Questions 7, 14 and others concern the disclosures CitiFinancial makes regarding insurance. Here, CitiFinancial is instructing its employees in writing to not \"over disclose.\" The CitiFinancial script explains the reason for this: it is \"an indication the employee does not believe in the product.\" As noted, there are many good reasons not to believe in the sale of insurance on such items as leaf blowers, lawnmowers, fishing rods and ice chests. Cynically, this \"don't over disclose\" directive is followed by Citigroup's throw-away line, \"do the right thing.\" The right thing for whom, we (and the FRB) might ask.\nThis script continues: \"Ask 'What kind of payment do you feel comfortable with?' Then develop a protected loan to fill the need. THIS ONE PHRASE WILL IMPROVE SALES ENORMOUSLY.\" (Emphasis added). Among other things, the above-quoted shows that CitiFinancial tells its employees to assume that the applicant wants insurance and to always in the first instance \"develop a protected loan.\"\nCitigroup has stated more than once in this proceeding that insurance sales volume is not an \"overriding\" factor in CitiFinancial's employees' compensation. The FRB has asked about this, in Question 6. Whatever Citigroup responds in its now-extended response period, we wish to highlight bullet point 4 in Exhibit 7.3, which instructs that \"Everyone is to maintain a personal tracking sheet and calculate $\/K or PPL on each loan. TOP BRANCHES ALWAYS DO THIS.\" It is difficult to decide what to highlight in this last quote: EVERY employ is to track their own insurance sales; ALL \"top branches always do this.\" As an aside, ICP has heard this colloquially described by CitiFinancial employees as \"tracking for packing\" -- that is, insurance packing, which is the predictable and inexorable result of Citi"}
{"text":"Financial's compensation scheme and internal directive such as those attached hereto.\nExhibit 7.3 continues, at bullet point 5, with the statement that \"We are a secured lender. Ask for collateral. Update property list on every loan. We can write PPI on the total of payments.\" The nexus between compiling the property lists and selling insurance could not be clearer.\nThe function of this Exhibit 7.3 within CitiFinancial is clear (and responsive to the FRB's AI letter): \"The purpose of any training it to bring about changes in the participant.\" Among the \"changes\" which are the purpose of this CitiFinancial training document is to convince employees not to \"over disclose,\" to track their own insurance sales, and to take property lists and sell insurance on every loan. CitiFinancial is a predatory lender -- by design.\nHow does these \"training\" play out at the level of individual employees? Exhibit 7.4 hereto is a note by a CitiFinancial employee that \"I will offer every product available to every customer that I speak with. With no exceptions. This includes Home & Auto product.\"\nFrom the individual to the nationwide: Exhibit 7.5 hereto provides \"Annual [Insurance] Claims Summary\" information for 23 states. Citigroup's insurers' actual payment of claims are unprecedentedly low in comparison to the insurance premiums collected. The FRB and others can compare this claims-paid information to premiums-collected information (which the FRB has requested), or to the number of CitiFinancial offices in each state. The chart is broken down into Disability Claims, Life Claims, Property Claims and Involuntary Unemployment Claims. In the state of Tennessee, for example -- in which each of CitiFinancial's 70 offices aggressively sells property insurance (see supra, Exhibit 7.3, bullet point 5), Citi in a complete year paid out only 48 claims, for only $78,121. In Virginia, Citi paid out only 25 claims, for only $28,557. In New Mexico, Citi paid out only 22 claims, for only $31,222. In New York, Citi paid out only 30 claims, for only $42,209. This should be compared to the volume of premiums collected, and policies in force -- and appropriate referrals and enforcement actions should be made and taken.\nExhibit 7.6 is a script to convince applicants who say they don't want insurance to \"take\" it. It is headed, \"Questions to ask customers when they say...\" and provides between three and five statements to use in response to five possible customer statements. Perhaps the most telling is Customer Statement #4, \"I don't want it.\" One might think that would be the end of the discussion. But CitiFinancial provides five come-backs, ranging from \"Can Mrs.\/Mr. ____ make this payment if something happens to you?\" to \"Maybe I didn't explain to you what this program can do for you.\" To Customer Statement #5, \"It costs too much,\" Citigroup suggests this come-back: \"The coverage is included in the payment -- you will not have to make an additional payment each month.\" This CitiFinancial script speaks for itself. Citigroup's applications should be denied and appropriate enforcement actions taken.\nAs noted above, Citigroup's failure to even purport to respond to the exhibits, including internal CitiFinancial documents, which ICP submitted on June 24 (three and a half weeks ago) and thereafter, combined with Citigroup's failure to meet the stated deadline on the FRB's July 3 Additional Information letter (many of the questions in which are related to exhibits ICP submitted as far back as June 3) militate for and require an extension of the comment period. The FRB should hold a public meeting on the application. On the current record, the agencies could not legitimately approve Citigroup's applications.\nUpdate of July 15, 2002: following the July 8 formal meeting, and receipt of the Federal Reserve's 34 questions to Citigroup (Citi's responses are due on July 17), ICP submitted a sixth comment and more exhibits on July 15. The comment is summarized below. For now, both the Fed and OTS say their comment periods expire on July 18. But Citi's response to the 34 questions are due July 17; Citi group continues to withhold relevant documents, etc.. So the requests continue.\nRE: ICP's sixth timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a sixth timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates,"}
{"text":" including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nICP submitted detailed comments, with multiple CitiFinancial exhibits, on June 3, 10, 24 and 30, 2002. On July 8 the Office of Thrift Supervision (\"OTS\") held a formal meeting, which the FRB attended. At the conclusion of the formal meeting, the OTS extended its comment period through July 18; the FRB followed suit. This comment is timely.\nWhile Citigroup has yet to respond to exhibits that ICP submitted three weeks ago (see infra), ICP is attaching hereto further exhibits reflecting systemic predatory lending at CitiFinancial. The FRB's most recent Additional Information letter poses 34 questions. The responses are due July 17; the comment period should be extended to permit review and rebuttal of Citi's responses. FRB Question 16 concerns CitiFinancial's system of \"Upsell[ing],\" and asks Citigroup to \"[i]dentify all safeguards implemented to prevent the potential circumvention of procedures established to help ensure that customers receive appropriate products.\" Whatever Citigroup responds, attached hereto as Exhibit 6.1 is an internal CitiFinancial memorandum from Don Laney to all Region and District Managers (cc-ing Ed Starkey and Habib Akawi) introducing a\n\"form to be used by the branch manager to document their monthly review of personal loans to homeowners that were booked but not upgraded to full secured real estate loan... to assist the branch in improving their upgrade performance.\" (Emphasis added).\nIn response to FRB Question 16, far from being \"safeguards\" in place at CitiFinancial, it is systemic policy to convert personal loans to liens against borrowers' homes. Another aspect of \"Upsell\" is demonstrated by Exhibit 6.2 hereto, a memorandum promulgating a new policy:\n\"ANY NEW PERSONAL HOME OWNERS THAT SCORE - EXCELLENT, GOOD, OR AVERAGE - LESS THAN $5,000 ADVANCE NEEDS DISTRICT MANAGER APPROVAL.\nI suggest that you try to upsell so you can by pass this.\" (Emphasis added).\nHere, regardless of the size of loan requested by the applicant, CitiFinancial loan officers will have to go and obtain District Manager approval if they are not \"maxing-out\" the personal loan (which in turn they are then supposed to further upsell to a lien against the applicant's home). In light of such memoranda, and the other exhibits ICP has submitted, ICP is dubious of any \"safeguards\" which Citigroup now presents - and the regulators including the FRB should be dubious as well.\nRegarding insurance packing, of which the FRB has asked questions as well, Exhibit 6.3 hereto is a memorandum from Citi's insurance company American Health & Life, which shows not only that many customers leave their closings without understanding they have been \"sold\" credit insurance, but also that CitiFinancial is aware of this, and comes up with the idea of actually explaining the insurance at closing, while remaining \"positive\" (see second page of Exhibit 6\/3, regarding \"Welcome letter from Home Office:\" \"we should remind our employees to be positive when reviewing the letter...\").\nRegarding the pressure on CitiFinancial employees to force-sell credit insurance (and \"upsell\" loans), Exhibit 6.4 hereto, a memo from July 2, 2002, refers to documents on CitiFinancial's \"CFWeb\" intra-net which \"provide[] details of the qualifiers,\" including, as ICP has shown, \"qualifying\" levels of credit insurance sales. The regulators including the FRB should request and obtain print-outs of these and other CFWeb documents.\nRegarding CitiFinancial's lack of responsiveness to state regulators' inquiries into forced-placed credit insurance, Exhibit 6.5 hereto shows a complaint from a state regulators which CitiFinancial repeatedly delayed in responding to, and finally responded to with a handwritten note essentially extinguishing the claim by stating that it was conveniently not in CitiFinancial's vaunted computer system.\nRegarding the pressure to upsell \/ convert Sale Finance Contracts into CitiFinancial loans (then real estate loans), Exhibit 6.6 hereto is an internal CitiFinancial document listing nationwide \"District Rankings\" in this regard.\nExhibit 6.7 is an internal CitiFinancial list regarding \"how to generate a loan per day,\" including the directives to \"Get unreasonable\" and to \"Do whatever it takes.\" And that is among the problems: CitiFinancial has designed an incentive system which virtually requires employees to force-place insurance, to \"upsell\" and otherwise gouge customers, all the while telling them with a wink and a nod to \"do the right thing every time.\" CitiFinancial is a predatory lender: not on an anecdotal basis, not on a branch-by-branch or state-by-state basis, but systemically"}
{"text":", company-wide. Given the issues that have arisen, the comment period should be extended to allow comment on Citigroup's responses, due July 17, to the Additional Information letter's questions; the FRB should hold a public meeting and on the current record should deny Citigroup's applications.\nWhile ICP continues to review the 232-page Transcript (the \"Tr.\") of the formal meeting, ICP reiterates its concern that Citigroup arrogantly chose to ignore the specifics of the testimony at the formal meeting, and the exhibits ICP has submitted to date. Citigroup's Marge Magner read prepared statements, Tr. at 160-167 and 203-211. In her rebuttal, she repeated a statement made in Citigroup's July 3 \"Omnibus Response,\" that \"with respect to allegations in various documents regarding individual borrowers... which are been published by one commenter, these allegations were subject to review... the review identified only one issue and corrective actions was taken. Additional materials have been provided more recently by the same commenter. CitiFinancial's in the process of reviewing those materials in the same fashion it reviewed the earlier ones.\" Tr. at 210.\nThe \"additional materials\" referred to including exhibits ICP submitted on June 24: three weeks ago. The comment cannot close with Citigroup repeatedly stating that it will respond at some future date to exhibits submitted three weeks ago. Furthermore, in light of Ms. Magner's statement, it is important to note that Citigroup's \"review\" has included the brow-beating of CitiFinancial customers, and of the entire staff of CitiFinancial's Morristown, TN branch on July 8 and 9 -- that is, simultaneous with Ms. Magner reading her prepared statements. The Morristown office of CitiFinancial was essentially closed for two days of intimidating interviews, the focus of which was on how ICP obtained the documents, and not on the practices which they reflected. This is inconsistent with Citigroup's statements about its ethics hotline and \"whistleblower\" protections; it should be reviewed immediately by the regulators including the FRB. Given the issues that have arisen, the comment period should be extended to allow comment on Citigroup's responses, due July 17, to the Additional Information letter's questions, and to Citigroup's overdue response to ICP's June 24 and 30 exhibits; the FRB should hold a public meeting and on the current record should deny Citigroup's applications.\nFurther on the managerial and lack-of-standards issues ICP has timely raised, and to most of which Citigroup has declined to timely respond: Citigroup has declined to provide WorldCom related documents requested by Congress members. See, e.g., N.Y. Daily News of July 13, 2002, \"Solomon's Document Delay Irks Congressman. See also, Financial Times of July 13, 2002, \"Securities Body Joins Salomon IPO Inquiry.\" See also, N.Y. Post of July 11, 2002: \" Responding to Rep. Paul Kanjorski's (D-Pa.) query about whether IPO shares had been set aside for WorldCom's executives, Grubman said, 'I don't recall. I'm not saying \"no,\" I'm not saying \"yes.\"' However, Kanjorski said his request was prompted not by Grubman's testimony, but because of other information. 'We had some prior information that indicated that this [WorldCom execs had received IPO shares] was the case,' Kanjorski said.\"\nOn the predatory lending issues that have arisen and been documented regarding CitiFinancial, Citigroup cannot be allowed to be similar evasive. Citigroup must respond to the exhibits that were submitted on June 24 and 30; the comment period should be extended to allow comment on Citigroup's responses, due July 17, to the Additional Information letter's questions, and to Citigroup's overdue response to ICP's June 24 and 30 exhibits; the FRB should hold a public meeting and on the current record should deny Citigroup's applications.\nUpdate of July 11, 2002: While requests are being made to the Federal Reserve to hold its own public hearing on Citigroup and its Golden State application, the Fed has now posed 34 questions to Citigroup on subprime lending issues. Many of the questions relate to the documentation of CitiFinancial's practices that Inner City Press has been submitting to the Fed since June 3. For example, the Fed has asked:\n\"Describe in detail how the 'Mystery Shopping' program was conducted in 2001 and 2002 (through June). Provide detailed information on any advance notice or information concerning the Mystery Shopping program and\/or visitations that CitiFinancial provided to regional, district or branch personnel during that time period... [ICP note: see ICP Exh. 3 of 6\/3\/02: \"mystery\" shopping heads-up].\n\"Discuss in detail all procedures instituted to ensure that CitiFinancial's incentive compensation practices"}
{"text":" conform to the Citigroup Initiatives. Identify all safeguards implemented to prevent potential abuses (such as 'loan flipping' and lending at the maximum LTV when such loan amount is not requested) and other actions from circumventing these procedures, including the nature and findings of any audits or other investigations conducted and any follow-up actions taken as a result.\n...\"Citigroup stated that '[s]ales of credit insurance do not represent an overriding factor in determining loan officer compensation.' Describe in detail the precise formulas for calculating all incentive compensation for (a) insurance and protection plan sales; (b) finance conversation; and (c) renewal loans for existing borrowers (including both upgrades from unsecured real estate-secured and present borrower renewals). Provide these formulas separately for each of the following category of employee: Customer Service Representative; Assistant Branch Manager; Branch Manager; District Managers; Regional Managers; and any other category of employee receiving incentive compensation calculated on the basis of sale volume in the three loan categories described above.

In addition, please send a copy of the non-confidential portion of your response to the commenters...\".\nWe could further annotate these questions, tying even more of them to the evidence ICP obtained and submitted to the Fed. But that's not the point (and one could make the comparison easily by comparing the questions to ICP's comments, below, which describe the exhibits ICP has put into the record. See, e.g., \"Another Fed Probe of Citi Subprime Lending Arm,\" by Rob Garver, American Banker, July 12, 2002, Pg. 1). The main point however is: the questions have been asked and now Citigroup must answer. Citigroup will probably try to withhold most of its answers, but a combination of the Freedom of Information Act and the Fed's rules against \"ex parte\" communications should prevent Citigroup from hiding its answers, its actual practices, as it had been attempting to do for some time.\nMeanwhile, this report from the field: on July 10, CitiFinancial attorney Clarence Rison interviewed an individual who quite recently left CitiFinancial's employ. He demanded to know how Inner City Press had learned of certain loans and practices. Citigroup's response is to browbeat and intimidate those who complain, rather than fix any problems. A larger story is brewing but will have to wait.\nUpdate of July 9, 2002: at yesterday's formal meeting on Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp,"}
{"text":" Citi's main speaker for Marge Magner, \"Chief Operating Officer of Citigroup's Consumer Group.\" Ms. Magner (at times hereinbelow \"the COO\") began speaking at 4:45 p.m. EST -- we use the word \"speaking\" loosely, because The COO in fact read a prepared statement which entirely ignored the adverse issues that had been raised, other than in the single (final) sentence, \"Citigroup is proud of its consumer lending practices, especially the Real Estate Lending Initiatives.\" This despite that fact that loan flipping, insurance packing and other predatory practices had been documented for the record, particularly concerning CitiFinancial's non-real estate \"consumer\" loans.\nICP went first in rebuttal and highlighted to the more-than-a-dozen regulators present that Citigroup's COO's presentation had been entirely non-responsive, and that Citigroup's applications should be suspended until Citi responds to the issue, and until the Federal Reserve completes and makes public the examination of CitiFinancial on which it conditioned its approval of Citi-EAB in mid-2001. Speakers for the other commenters, from California and North Carolina, expressed similar outrage at Citigroup's failure to respond to the issues raised. Citigroup was then granted 20 minutes to reply. And... the COO once again read in a monotone from a written statement that had been prepared, apparently, prior to any of the testimony or rebuttals. Her final statement was read verbatim from Citigroup's July 3 \"Omnibus Response,\" that ICP had submitted \"additional material... in its filings dated June 24 and June 30, 2002. CitiFinancial is in the process of reviewing those materials in the same fashion it reviewed the earlier materials that have been made available on 'the commenter's' website and filed with the banking agencies. To date, it does not appear that any of the materials that have been reviewed reflect violations of policy or law.\"\nBut that material was submitted to the regulators and to Citigroup two weeks ago. To state that it \"is being reviewed\" while arguing to close the comment period is inconsistent with the purpose of the regulators' comment-and-response process. Citigroup's \"General Counsel - Bank Regulatory\" then argued that no extension of the comment period was needed (in particular he said that \"one commenter\" has had \"unusual access to [Citi's] information\"). It was pointed out that Citigroup is withholding the list it has submitted of branches it is considering closing -- information release in the Fed's Union Planters - Leader Federal and other proceedings -- and a list of subprime lenders with which Citi's Solomon Smith Barney does business, information released in the OTS' WaMu-Dime and in the Fed's U.S. Bancorp - Firstar proceeding. The OTS' Presiding Officer, who played the same role in WaMu-Dime, stated that the situation on Citigroup's application is factually different. ICP pointed out that the OTS had not even given ICP a preliminary response to its June 10 FOIA request.\nAfter much back and forth, the OTS Presiding Officer agreed to keep the comment period open for a week after the transcript of the public meeting becomes available (currently anticipated July 11, which would translate to a July 18 expiration of comment period). A Fed Legal Division staffer stated that the Fed will also keep its comment period open, but only for participants in the OTS formal meeting. Virtually all community commenters requested a second hearing, after the examination of CitiFinancial, promised by the Fed a year ago, is completed. The formal meeting concluded at nearly 7 p.m. EST; across the Hudson in an alternative universe, Citigroup's Sandy Weill was preparing to accept an award on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange...\nAt the formal meeting, it was emphasized that not only Ms. Magner, but also Bob Willumstad and Sandy Weill, have all been involved in designing, implementing and overseeing the CitiFinancial practices complained of. In fact, ICP has heard from numerous CitiFinancial employees who attended a \"rah-rah\" talk given by Ms. Magner in Baltimore to CitiFinancial employees. Ms. Magner was CEO of CitiFinancial for five years. Which makes her silence on these issues all the more befuddling. Based on the reviews provided by the CitiFinancial employees, ICP on July 2 urged both the OTS and Citigroup that other Citi representatives come to the formal meeting to address these issues: either Bob Willumstad (who signed various of CitiFinancial's purported reforms) or in the alternative Mike Knapp. Oh well.\nFollowing the formal meeting, ICP was informed that Citigroup's response to the detailed Tennessee predatory lending documentation -- which the COO refused to address -- has been for CitiFinancial's David Baer and legal personnel from CitiFinancial's \"Home Office\""}
{"text":" in Baltimore to call a customer at her job, demanding to know whether she was the source of any of the documentation. Despite the context, the CitiFinancial representatives stated that they were \"not trying to intimidate\" the customer. Thou dost protests too much... Documentation of this and other matters will be submitted in the new comment period, before July 18. This will be updated.\nUpdate of July 8, 2002: in the run-up to the July 8 formal meeting on Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp, Citigroup on July 2 told the Office of Thrift Supervision that it would finally submit a response to ICP's and others' comments by July 3. At 4:20 p.m. on July 3, Citigroup put out a press release announcing a vague $120 billion lending commitment. The press release said that more information was available on Citigroup's web site, but that was not true, as of 11 p.m. on July 3. Also on July 3, Citigroup submitted its response to the OTS, FDIC and Federal Reserve. Half of the response consists of old documents from 2000 and 2001. In the new \"Omnibus\" response, Citigroup states among other things that \"informing branches of the mystery shopping program has a prophylactic effect\" (we'll let that one stand without comment); and that\n\"additional material have been provided by Inner City Press in its filings dated June 24 and June 30, 2002... CitiFinancial is in the process of reviewing those materials in the same fashion it reviewed the earlier materials that have been made available on Inner City Press' website and filed with the banking agencies. To date, it does not appear that any of the materials that have been reviewed reflect violations of policy or law.\"\nPresumably Citigroup acknowledges, then, that its goal is to strip the equity our of as many moderate income homeowner's chief asset as possible (see last Week's Report).\nOn July 1 the Federal Reserve provided ICP with some portions of Citigroup's application which Citigroup had wrongly withheld, along with some of the Fed's internal communications about the application, up to June 10 (the date of ICP's Freedom of Information Act request). These documents show:\nOn May 28, the Fed held a conference call with Citigroup to allow Citigroup to \"explain[] the various steps, structure, timing and various required regulatory filings\" related to the proposed merger. Attending for Citigroup were Carl Howard, Jim Scott, Jeff Wattiker and John Gunther, as well as two lawyers from Skadden Arps. Citigroup \"indicated that they may file on or about June 7, 2002 and would like to close by the end of August.\" [ICP note: Citigroup has told state regulators they aim to close by the end of July -- whatever makes the agencies move faster, appears to be Citigroup's approach]. Citigroup's outside counsel \"suggested that even though this is still a bank transaction the major issues involved would be dealt with at the OTS and as such it may qualify for a waiver. Citigroup representatives asked whether the case might proceed on a delegated track. Staff replied that they could not speak for the Governors and that public comments may affect the timing. Staff also said that the case would be delegated to the Secretary of the Board due to Mr. Weil's [sic] presence on this Reserve Bank's Board of Directors if it were delegated at all.\"\nThe Fed's internal e-mails have been provided only in redacted form. In a June 7 e-mail, SF Fed staff informs NY Fed staff that \"I spoke with Liz [REDACTED].\" The response to that message, from the NY to SF Fed, is \"[REDACTED]. Agreed?\" Yeah, sure. In a June 3 e-mail, Fed DCCA staff writes that \"Citi has requested that the application be acted on by mid-July (that's a 45 day timeframe),\" following by a paragraph-long redaction.\nLeft in the e-mails was the following (sorry for the self-referential, almost post-modern vibe here, but this is FOIA, and here's what it says): on June 3, FRB legal staff writes that ICP's \"comments concerning the convenience and needs factor including info. on allegedly abusive CitiFinancial lending and credit insurance practices. [ICP] apparently received the info. from one or more CitiFinancial employees during the last six months (particularly in the Knoxville, TN area) -- including internal memos and CitiFinancial Maestro computer data. [ICP] also alleges disparities on race in Citigroup's 200 HMDA data and 2001 LARs data (NYC, Oakland, SF, LA, Chicago, DC, Rochester and Newark), \"steering\" allegations (prime vs. subprime lender); and concerns regarding SSB's lending to subprime lenders and underwriting of securitized subprime loan pools.\"\nThe following day, June 4"}
{"text":", FRB legal staff wrote to a dozen other staffers that \"Today, the Board received the first comment on this notice. The comment is from Inner City Press. Although I'm sure we all remember, this is to remind everyone that our internal processing of this notice is now subject to the Board's policy on ex parte communications with notificants. Given the high public profile of this deal it is particularly important that we adhere to proper procedures in this case at all time... ICP's comment seems to deal with the usual CRA\/fair lending\/ predatory lending concerns, especially in regard to CitiFinancial. Any communications with Citigroup on these matters should therefore be in writing, however inconvenient this may seem. If you feel that you absolutely, positively have to talk to Citigroup about a matter raised in a protest, please do not do so without someone from Board Legal on the phone. (Any oral ex parte discussions will have to be summarized in a memo that can be made public.)\"\nThat message was then forwarded by a DCCA staffer to another Fed fair lending specialist, who wrote, \"Thanks for the reminder on ex parte communications [REDACTED].\" This redacted message was responded to by Board Legal: \"S[upervisory] L[etter] 98-27 (9\/29\/98) covers the application of the Board's ex parte policy to supervisory \/ examination functions [REDACTED].\"\nIt seems clear that the Fed fair lending specialist's question concerned whether \"examination\" communications could circumvent the ex parte rules; S.R. 98-27 details the breadth of this loophole. Because of issues raised by the Fed's redactions, we feel a need to report the following: in late June, Fed staff stated that they are \"in the middle\" of the examination of CitiFinancial on which the Fed's approval of Citigroup's acquisition of EAB was conditioned in mid-2001. So the loophole is apparently not only large, but also live... While we will request what we can under FOIA, it would seem important for the Fed to summarize and disclose its communications with Citigroup in connection with that CitiFinancial examination, and the results to date of the examination, before ruling (other than denying) Citigroup's Golden State application...\nUpdate of July 3, 2002: At 4:20 p.m. today, Citigroup put out a press release announcing a 10-year, $120 billion \"lending and investment commitment to minority and low- and moderate-income individuals and communities.\" The press release does not mention the predatory lending issues that have been raised in opposition to Citigroup's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp -- it appears that the \"commitment\" is an attempt to evade and\/or obscure those issues. The press release states that \"Further details of this commitment are available at www.citigroup.com.\" However as of 5:00 p.m. on July 3, no \"further information about this commitment\" were visible on citigroup.com. ICP's position as of July 4: Citigroup's commitment does not address the systemic predatory lending is which CitiFinancial is engaged; Citigroup's press release does not even add up correctly (the sub-categories of the commitment are not specified, and much of Citigroup's 1998 \"commitment\" was in fact credit card lending).\nUpdate of July 2-3, 2002: in the run-up to the Office of Thrift Supervision formal meeting on July 8, the FDIC wrote to ICP on July 2 stating that \"Per your request... we are extending the comment period... We will also attend the formal hearing scheduled for July 8, 2002.\" On an OTS conference call on July 2, Citigroup stated that it will be bringing 10 people to the formal meeting. ICP requested that at least one of Citi's speakers be prepared to address the CitiFinancial predatory lending issues that have been raised, and that Citigroup release the list of prospective branch closures it has submitted to the Federal Reserve but which it is seeking to withhold from the public. It is said that Citigroup will be announcing a unilateral lending pledge regarding California and Nevada. It is remembered that a significant portion of the 1998 Citicorp-Travelers pledge was credit card lending; additionally, any pledge that does not address the predatory lending issues that have arisen and been documented... does not address the issues.\nUpdate of July 1, 2002: As further documentation of predatory lending by CitiFinancial continues to flow in -- this time, an \"equity stripping\" hit-list -- the Federal Reserve Board last week responded to ICP's request for a hearing by stating that the Fed will \"participate\" in the Office of Thrift Supervision's July 8 formal meeting. ICP has submitted a similar to request to the FDIC. Below is a summary of ICP's fifth comment opposing Citigroup's application.\nRE: ICP's Fifth timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's"}
{"text":" applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a fifth timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nICP submitted detailed comments, with multiple CitiFinancial exhibits, on June 3, 10 and 24, 2002. As noted in ICP's June 17 submission, Citigroup's response was due on that day. A week later, no response from Citigroup had been received. Late on Monday June 24, ICP received from Citigroup two documents: a late-filed response to ICP's June 3 and other comments, and a response to questions the FRB posed on June 18, 2002. Both are replied to below. ICP has received the FRB's June 27 letter stating that the FRB will participate in the Office of Thrift Supervision's (the \"OTS's\") formal meeting on July 8, 2002. ICP continues to urge the FRB to hold its own public meeting, under its own regulations -- the FRB is Citigroup's (and CitiFinancial's) primary regulator. The FRB has recently stated that it \"expects banking holding companies and their affiliates to conduct their subprime lending activities without any abusive lending practices.\" (Board Order of June 24, 2002, n.18). CitiFinancial, as further demonstrated below, does not meet this standard: CitiFinancial is engaged in systematic predatory lending.\nAs bases for the denial of Citigroup's applications and for other appropriate enforcement actions, further pre-hearing documents annexed to this fifth timely comment include:\nExhibit 5.1 hereto is an internal CitiFinancial document from the Maestro computer system wherein CitiFinancial provides branches with lists of customers to solicit for new loans, sorted by Loan to Value ratio (\"LTV\") and \"Remaining Income.\" This is essentially an equity-stripping list: customers with the lowest LTV (that is, with the most equity remaining in their homes) are solicited for new loans, to attach \/ strip the equity. This, combined with the other exhibits ICP has submitted, demonstrates the degree to which CitiFinancial has reduced equity stripping and predatory lending to a science. The \"Remaining Income\" column is particularly troubling. Midway through the first page we find that the customer with Account Number 101477 has, following CitiFinancial's loans of May 17, 2000, a Remaining Income of only $83.96 a month. CitiFinancial calculates this Remaining Income figure by taking gross income, subtracting loan payments, bills as reflected by credit bureaus and utilities ($175 for homeowners): what's left is \"Remaining Income.\"\nThe customer with Account Number 206748 was left, following CitiFinancial's loan of September 5, 2001, with a NEGATIVE \"Remaining Income, \"-50.45\" dollars a month. Of all the borrowers on this Maestro system page, this is the only borrower for whom a telephone number is not listed -- not surprisingly, phone disconnected. CitiFinancial by any definition, including those used by the Federal Reserve (most recently in Governor Olson's previously quoted speech) is a predatory lender.\nExhibit 5.2 hereto is an internal CitiFinancial document known as the \"Insurance Summary.\" It documents the centrality of (packed) credit insurance to CitiFinancial. Beginning at the top, for the Johnson City, Tennessee CitiFinancial branch (# 099), the document reflects that in the first 16 days of March 2002 on this branch's personal loans, 84.2% of loans including life insurance; 57.9% of loans included Accident and Health (disability) insurance; fully 42.1% of loans included \"Property Insurance\" -- a product CitiFinancial's use of which is predatory per se, as specified in ICP's previous comments (and see infra); and 47.4% of loans included Involuntary Unemployment Insurance. The check mark next to the above-recited results indicates a satisfactory level of insurance packing. The \"Measure\" column reflects a score of 100.1, enough to score points for the branch under CitiFinancial's previously described \"RocoPoly\" bonus system. The far-right column reflects insurance on Real Estate Loans (100% penetration for life insurance by the Johnson City branch). The handwritten notations on the Insurance Summary are by CitiFinancial District Manager Jim Chakales, as is the comment at the end of the Summary, that \"Team, this is not the direction we need to be headed... Remember starting today we belong to the 7500 Club. You get it.\" The 7"}
{"text":"500 Club refers to a volume of Auto and Health insurance sold and kept in place despite customers' attempts to cancel. See Exhibit 5.3, discussed infra.\nThe results for the Kingsport (#100), Knoxville (#101), Jefferson, Bristol, Kingsport (#525), Greeneville, Knoxville (# 685), Morristown and Johnson City branches, in terms of packing insurance on personal loans is deemed insufficient by CitiFinancial's Insurance Summary \/ RocoPoly system (and by the District Manager's circles on the form). The scores obtained -- despite insurance penetration levels as high as 89.5% (Kingsport branch #100 for life insurance) -- do not qualify the branches for a RocoPoly bonus. However credit insurance packed onto real estate loans at the Bristol, Kingsport (# 525), Greeneville and Morristown branches is deemed enough for bonuses to be paid.\nNote that the Insurance Summary contains a line for \"Single Premium\" insurance: each of the ten branches reviewed in this Summary impose it.\nThe final page of Exhibit 5.2 are similar numbers for three other CitiFinancial districts, all under CitiFinancial Regional Manager David Baer. Of these, Tennessee Valley is the \"strongest,\" in terms of imposing Single Premium credit insurance.\nAbove we noted CitiFinancial district manager Jim Chakales' exhortation that \"starting today we belong to the 7500 Club. You get it.\" The 7500 Club refers to a volume of Auto and Health insurance sold and kept in place despite customers' attempts to cancel. Exhibit 5.3 hereto is a June 18, 2002, memorandum from CitiFinancial's Region Sales Manager Mike Gorman to branches stating that \"David Bradshaw from FIMC (Home & Auto) will be holding a short training session for the Branches listed below. David will be discussing how cancellations might happen and what you can do to help prevent them.\" Emphasis added. The training centers on how to talk customers out of canceling this CitiFinancial insurance after they request to cancel it.\nExhibit 5.4 hereto concerns a CitiFinancial \"Problem Account\" -- customer Betty Arnold. CitiFinancial branch manager Lisa Wilcox writes that \"This is an insurance litigation case. We need to AOT this...\". AOT stands for \"Adjustment of Terms.\" The annexed Maestro print-out reflects (3\/22\/02) that \"This was a joint account[.] The co-borrower died[.] They had a real estate loan and a personal loan. American Health and Life p[ai]d personal but not real estate. This is going to court...\". Question: why would Citi's American Health & Life pay on one insurance policy (the personal loan) but not on the real estate loan? The back-story and answer: on the personal loan the customers did not have to answer the health questions; on the real estate loans ($140,000), they did. There are indications of document forgery (i.e. CitiFinancial staff filling out the forms and answering the questions themselves).\nExhibit 5.5 hereto is another sample \"Property Insurance\" policy by Citi's Triton Insurance company, this time collecting $775.00 in premiums on a 1995 Honda which CitiFinancial included in the property list for a \"semi-secured personal loan\" and valued at $4,900.00.\nExhibit 5.6 hereto is CitiFinancial's \"Policy Violation Recap\" for a single month, for a single office (Morristown, Tennessee). During this month, this office engaged in (at least) THIRTY TWO policy violations, most of them involving distortion of reported delinquency. Not surprisingly, most of the violations occur during the final ten days of the month, when branches are trying to make their result meet the threshold for a \"RocoPoly\" bonus from CitiFinancial. Many of the violations involve flipping: issuing \"Refinance Balance Only\" (\"RBO\") loans too frequently or on already delinquent accounts. On February 19, 2002 on Account Number 36728, the branch did \"RBO More than Once a Year.\" The same on Account Number 36734 on February 20; the same on Account Number 36740 on February 22; on Account Number 36746 on February 26; on Accounts Number 36756 and 36756 on February 28, 2002.\nICP's ongoing inquiry has found systemic distortion of delinquency at CitiFinancial. Exhibit 5.6 reflects same techniques which CitiFinancial itself found at a single branch in a single month. ICP has been told of CitiFinancial employees advancing customers' due dates including by informal and unauthorized payments from other accounts. An example: in a CitiFinancial conference call in May 2000, district manager Jim Chakales instructed ten branch managers to do \"whatever they had to do\" to reduce delinquency numbers, including by issuing \"tornado deferments\" despite the fact that no tornadoes had occurred"}
{"text":", and by canceling customers' insurance in order to mis-apply insurance premiums they'd paid to their loans, to advance the due dates. One of the branch managers so instructed telephoned CitiFinancial 1-800 ethics line and reported this, the day after the call. Soon thereafter, district manager Chakales telephoned the branch managers individually to \"inform\" them that he hadn't made his previous statement. Later, CitiFinancial \"investigated\" the complaint by interviewing only one of the ten branch managers who'd been on the call. And nothing was ever done. This reflects (1) the previously-demonstrated laxity of CitiFinancial's compliance culture, including of the 1-800 Ethics line (to which the South Carolina CitiFinancial employees whose tales ICP has previously recounts also complained, without effect -- see, e.g., \"Citigroup Hires Prominent Lawyer in Loan Abuse Case,\" Reuters, July 27, 2001; \"Citi Corroborates Two Allegations,\" American Banker, July 30, 2001; and (2), given current development reflecting the effects of accounting irregularities, is a separate ground on which Citigroup's applications should be denied, inquiries begun, completed and appropriate enforcement actions taken.\nICP's Reply to Citigroup's \"Response\" Dated June 21, 2002\nUnder the heading \"Prevention of Predatory Lending,\" Citigroup claims to have \"undertaken numerous initiatives to ensure that none of its lenders engage in predatory lending.\" It is important to note that Citigroup's publicly-announced initiatives have related only to real estate secured lending, and that much of the evidence ICP has timely submit concerns personal loans, so-called semi-secured loans. Citigroup's Response (the \"Resp.\") is non-responsive.\nFor example, Citigroup's first substantive paragraph in this section discusses its purport shift away from single premium credit insurance. ICP has shown that CitiFinancial continues to routinely impose single premium credit insurance on \"personal\" loans, more than half of its business. Additionally ICP has shown that CitiFinancial's offers of monthly pay credit insurance to real estate secured borrowers has been limited (see ICP's June 24 Comment and exhibits).\nCitigroup's purported Response does not directly address ICP's showing that CitiFinancial branches were informed of the stop and start dates of the purported mystery shopping, and what would be shopped for. (See ICP's June 3 Comment and exhibits, and American Banker of June 24, 2002). Citigroup states obliquely that \"CitiFinancial branches are notified that mystery shopping can occur at any time, but they are not notified of the precise dates on which it will occur.\"\nExhibit 3 to ICP's June 3 Comment was a memorandum to CitiFinancial's Southeast Division from Division leader Wendell R. Miller. In the memo, the dates of the \"mystery\" shop are specified, as well as what will be tested for:\n\"Telephone: The test is do we service every customer consistently, i.e.: do we quote the same rates, LTVs, etc.? Are we consistent?\nBranch visits: A minority and a caucasian will visit the same or separate branches and request identical loans. The test is do we quote the same rate, LTV, etc., and do we give equal service to each?\"\nThe implication is, be sure to keep the offers consistent during the duration of the test. The ending date of the \"mystery\" shopping is also specified, as the Exhibit makes clear and as reported in the American Banker of June 24, 2002 (\"Too Much Information? Citi Mystery-Shop Sparks Debate,\" by Erick Bergquist, Page 17) [snip]\nAs noted, the memo was cc-ed to Tim Baechtold, Division Operations Manager, and to K.C. Mead and Ed Starkey. Citigroup's \"Response\" is not credible.\nSimilarly, Citigroup rather than responding to ICP's detailed showing of incentives for insurance packing (through RocoPoly bonuses and otherwise) states that \"[s]ales of credit insurance do not represent an overriding factor in determining loan officer compensation.\" But fully 30 of the 100 possible (and 60 required) QUICPlan points are related to credit insurance sales. Again, Citigroup's \"Response\" is not credible...\nCitigroup's June 21, 2002, Response implies that the FRB's referenced exam is now completed. As notes, Citigroup on December 14, 2001, wrote to the FDIC that\n[t]he Federal Reserve Board will conduct that examination and take action following that examination as appropriate. (Emphasis added).\nFrom this phrasing, in a December 14, 2001, letter from Citigroup's Carl Howard to the FDIC, it appears that the Fed had still not completed the examination of CitiFinancial, five months after it was announced in mid-2001 as a \"condition"}
{"text":"\" for the FRB to approve Citi-EAB. If it has been conducted in 2002, the results should be disclosed in this proceeding, including in light of Citigroup's claims in its June 21, 2002, Response.\nCitigroup states, Resp. at 10, that\nwith respect to allegations about individual borrowers, as various documents or allegations were published on the Inner City Press website, they were subjected to review by CitiFinancial's Compliance Department to determine whether there was evidence of any actions inconsistent with CitiFinancial policy and procedure. It was determined that with one exception the loans were made in accordance with applicable federal and state law guidelines, as well as company policy and procedure. Of the many Tennessee situations identified on the website and in the Comment, the review identified only one raised an issue [sic]. It was determined that a refund of an insurance premium was due. The premium was then refunded. Counsel for CitiFinancial consulted with the Compliance Department about the account reviews.\nBy stating that its \"review identified only one raised an issue\" [sic], Citigroup is apparently claiming that it stands behind the practices in which CitiFinancial engaged in connection with the other loans ICP has documents in this proceeding. Why, then, is Citigroup canceling Ms. Craig's loan? Why is CitiFinancial \"AOT\"-ing the loan documented in the instant comment? Why did Citi's American Health & Life pay on one of the customers' life insurance policy but not the other? Citigroup should be required to respond to the issues ICP has raised, not evade the questions by referring to some internal review. And, clearly, information must be submitted into the record on the loan which Citigroup admits in the above-quoted violated its own policies...\nCitigroup's cover letter refers to a \"Confidential Exhibit Binder\" (which ICP hereby requests, under FOIA and the FRB's ex parte rules); it seeks to withhold the list of branches it is \"contemplating\" closing and a list of subprime lenders which SSB enables; it seeks to delay until August 2002 its next \"semi-annual\" report, when the last one was in December 2001... Citigroup's final exhibit is a now six months old \"semi-annual\" report on CitiFinancial's \"Real Estate Lending Initiatives.\" Citigroup is attempting to delay its now-due next semi-annual report under August 2002, for reasons that should be obvious when compared to the timing of this application proceeding. The now-due report should be required to be submitted into the record, and Citigroup must be required to respond to the non-real estate predatory lending that ICP has documented.\nFurther on the managerial and lack-of-standards issues ICP has timely raised, and to most of which Citigroup has declined to timely respond: Congress has now subpoenaed SSB's Jack Grubman in connection with its investigation of the WorldCom fraud. See, e.g., \"Salomon Brothers May Face WorldCom Shareholder Suits,\" New York Times, June 29, 2002 Sec. C, Pg. 3; Col. 1. Note that this also calls into question the due diligence that Citi's SSB claims to do in its underwriting for and other business relationships with the questionable subprime lenders identified in ICP's previous comments. In terms of Citigroup's lack of environmental standards, controversy continues to grow around the proposed Camisea oil project, located in the rainforests of the Amazon's Lower Urubamba Valley on Peru's Pacific coast. \"If this project goes through, this rainforest will be turned into a parking lot within our lifetimes,\" says an analyst for Friends of the Earth. Citigroup serves as the financial adviser for the project -- and it is entirely unclear what due diligence it has performed, what standards it has applied (despite claims Citigroup has publicly made about having standards in this regard).\nBeyond the FRB's participation in the OTS's formal meeting on July 8, 2002, ICP continues to urge the FRB to hold its own public meeting, under its own regulations -- the FRB is Citigroup's (and CitiFinancial's) primary regulator. On the current record the FRB could not legitimately approve Citigroup's applications and notices.\nUpdate of June 27-28, 2002: This just in, from the Federal Reserve: \"This is in response to your letter regarding the notice filed by Citigroup, Inc.... to acquire California Federal Bank... Your letter requests that the Board hold hearings or public meetings on this notice. The Federal Reserve System will attend the formal meeting convened by the Office of Thrift Supervision on July 8, 2002... The oral testimony and written submissions of participants at the meeting will be made a part of the record considered by the Board in action on this notice. The Secretary of the Board, acting under delegated authority, has extended the Board's public comment period until July 8, 2002,"}
{"text":" in order to receive information provided at the meeting.\" [OTS contact information is below].\nUpdate of June 24, 2002: The Office of Thrift Supervision will be holding a \"formal meeting\" on Citigroup's application on July 8; ICP has asked the Federal Reserve to co-sponsor the OTS hearing or hold its own hearing. Citigroup is seeking to evade the predatory lending issues raised. Documentation of presumptive predatory lending at CitiFinancial continue to flow in to Inner City Press, and then to the regulators. On June 24, ICP filed sixteen more exhibits, described in the comment summarized below.\nRE: ICP's Fourth timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a fourth timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nICP submitted detailed comments, with multiple CitiFinancial exhibits, on June 3 and June 10, 2002. As noted in ICP's June 17 submission, Citigroup's response was due on that day. A week later, no response from Citigroup has been received. For the record, the Office of Thrift Supervision (\"OTS\") has confirmed that it will be holding a formal meeting on Citigroup's Golden State-related application on July 8, 2002. See Exhibit 4.16 hereto. ICP reiterates its timely request that the FRB co-sponsors the OTS formal meeting, and\/or schedule and hold its own public meeting, and extend the comment period accordingly.\nAs bases for the denial of Citigroup's applications and for other appropriate enforcement actions, further pre-hearing documents annexed to this fourth timely comment include:\nExhibit 4.1 hereto documents a loan made earlier this year (May 2, 2002) by CitiFinancial at 24.99% interest. To borrow $6,166.85, the customer pays $4,690.75 in finance charges, $563.22 for credit disability insurance, $353.35 for credit life insurance, and $250.00 in \"property insurance.\" As reflected by the Disclosure Statement, the loan is \"secured\" by \"Misc Pers[onal] Prop[erty].\" The list of property on which Citigroup's Triton Insurance Company has written explicitly \"Single Premium\" credit insurance includes \"various compact disks,\" a lawnmower, a leaf blower and various camera lenses. As demonstrated by ICP in this proceeding, CitiFinancial's only purpose in assembling \"miscellaneous personal property\" lists on consumer loans is to write insurance [FN: Question: does CitiFinancial actually repo and resell borrowers' personal compact disk collections (or fishing rods of ice chests, see ICP's June 3 submission)? Does CitiFinancial hold yard sales of such items? Our experience is, no. So (question that must be answered in this proceeding): why does CitiFinancial sell and encourage customers to buy credit insurance on such personal items? Why is this practice no predatory per se?], in this context a product that has no benefit to the borrower and is per se predatory.\nExhibit 4.2 hereto is a print-out from CitiFinancial's Maestro computer system reflecting that the customer on June 13, 2002 \"decided he didn't want per[sonal] prop[erty] protection. Had to backoff & when I did, it automatically jumped to $7500, need reapproval.\" Emphasis added. Here the CitiFinancial loan officer (\"dee\") characterizes giving in to a customer's resistance to (useless) personal property insurance and \"back[ing] off;\" note that when the customer tried to not get credit insurance from CitiFinancial, the Maestro computer system \"automatically\" changed the terms of the loan such that it could not be made without \"reapproval.\" ICP has been informed by current and former CitiFinancial employees that this is one of CitiFinancial's stratagems for essentially involuntarily imposing credit insurance on CitiFinancial customers.\nAs demonstrated in Exhibit 1 to ICP's June 3, 2002, submission, CitiFinancial bases its bonus on, inter alia, how much credit insurance can be imposed on loans, including both real estate and personal loans. To further confirm this for the record, Exhibit 4.3 hereto is the QUICPlan print-out for CitiFinancial's Morristown, TN branch for April 2002. As ICP's showed in its June 3 Exhibit 1, points are awarded in eleven different categories. If a total of sixty points is not"}
{"text":" reached, no bonus is given. Imposing credit insurance accounts for fully 30 points, broken down into credit insurance on personal loans, on real estate loans, on \"Equity Plus\" loans and a category referred to as \"Non credit.\"\nCitiFinancial's focus on aggressively imposing credit insurance is further documented by Exhibit 4.4 hereto, an internal CitiFinancial document entitled \"RocoPoly 2002: 2nd Quarter 2002 Insurance Kicker.\" It offers even greater \"payouts\" than the previously documented system, specifically for meeting aggressive \"QUICPlan\" insurance sales goals, even for a branch that scores only 50 (and not 60) on the overall QUICPLan goals.\nTo further document that CitiFinancial's focus on credit insurance packing in nationwide in scope, Exhibit 4.5 hereto lists the level of premium imposed required to hit the Qualified Level (\"QL\" in the chart) and Superior Level (\"SL\" in the chart) in each of 48 states and the District of Columbia, on Personal Loans, Equity Plus, Fully Secured [that is, real estate loans] and \"Non-Credit.\" The target numbers are calculated as dollars in insurance premiums per thousand dollars of loan.\nThat this QUICPlan compensation scheme, which encourages insurance packing, is CitiFinancial-wide is reflected in Exhibit 4.6 hereto: CitiFinancial's \"Focus\" publication \"of the Executive Office\", dated January 2002. There is \"A Message from Sandy Weill;\" there is a RocoPoly logo and the question, \"Are You Ready for the Knapp Challenge?\" The [Michael] \"Knapp Challenge\" offers \"Bigger Payouts\" for \"renewing those active Personal and Sales Finance Loans into Real Estate Loans... Succeed in the Knapp Challenge and RocoPolize your bonus!\" Mr. Knapp becomes more direct in the \"Focus\" publication of April 2002 (Exhibit 4.7 hereto), where he states that \"[a] project team has been in place for a few weeks designing a 'query' system to allow you to build your own cherry-picked lists from which to solicit your customers. Some of you may know that we've looked at doing this before and never came through, however, we're in a better position to handle that kind of technology at the branch level now.\" Emphasis added. CitiFinancial can now engage in types of \"cherry-picking\" that Associates never could. The next page of the April 2002 CitiFinancial \"Focus\" publication urges staff to \"[I]n these uncertain times, serve your customers by giving them all of the information on insurance to make an informed choice on insurance.\" (Emphasis added). The subsequent \"talking points\" provided are simply an advertisement for taking out disability and credit insurance, with three \"actual testimonials from [Citi's] American Health and Life Insurance Company\" for each product. These are hardly \"all of the information on insurance to make an informed choice on insurance.\"\nCitiFinancial's aggressive collection practices (documented in ICP's June 3, 2002, Exhibits with reference to \"field calls\" -- i.e. home visits -- by CitiFinancial employees) is further documented by Exhibit 4.8 hereto, a June 3, 2002 memo from CitiFinancial District Manager Jim Chakales to \"the staff\" stating that the collections \"goals must be met by close Friday or arrangements made for Saturday work.\" Exhibit 4.9 hereto is a \"Send Branch\" message over the Maestro system stating curtly that \"Three things to discuss 1. I am not going to beg you for foreclosures I will just write U up 2. I am not going to beg for R\/E bus[iness] 3. Need 20 LPE Control dues.\" (Emphasis added, spelling left as in original; note that \"LPE\" means \"Loans Per Employee\"). Exhibit 4.10 hereto is another of CitiFinancial's Jim Chakales' memos, \"Results from Real Estate Blitz Tonight, Knoxville West District - Jim Chakales,\" showing that CitiFinancial Branch # 101 made 18 calls, four contacts, and application only for \"RBO\" -- refinance balance only, i.e. flipping. CitiFinancial's Jim Chakales hand-wrote on the memo, regarding Branch # 722, \"This is two nights without an app[lication]?\" Apparently flipping is better than nothing (hence the prevalence of flipping at CitiFinancial).\nExhibit 4.11 hereto documents a real estate-secured loan of a ten-year term by CitiFinancial at 15.23% interest (June 11, 2002). To borrow $15,207.00, the customer pays $13,505.40 in finance charges, $301.77 for joint credit life insurance.\nOne of the first things that Citigroup did upon renaming the ex-Associates branches CitiFinancial was to systematically seek to raise the debt"}
{"text":" levels of Associates' borrowers. Exhibit 4.12 hereto is a memorandum from CitiFinancial's Donna Delude, Don Moroz and Wes Iseley to the \"'New' CitiFinancial Branches\" instructing ex-Associates staff to call \"each of your current customers\" and offer higher loans -- \"a great upsell opportunity to an Equity + or R[eal] E[state] loan...\".\nAmong the purported reforms to which CitiFinancial has attempted to limit review of CitiFinancial is the announced elimination of single premium credit insurance on real estate loans (Exhibit 4.1 demonstrates that CitiFinancial still sells single premium credit insurance on non-real estate loans, which are more than half of its business). Exhibit 4.13 hereto is a CitiFinancial's \"Field Implementation\" memo dated May 28, 2002, (finally) informing branches in Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin that \"[s]tarting June 3, 2002, an offer is being sent to certain existing Real Estate secured loan customers (including Equity Plus) to switch their current Single Premium Credit Insurance Products to Monthly Premium Credit Insurance.\" Note that customers with \"Pre-Computed Real Estate Loan[s]\" and customers deemed \"Cross-Border\" are \"exceptions\" to whom the offer is not sent. The memo says, \"attached are a few questions and answers that may be helpful to you when speaking with a customer about switching to Monthly.\" The question is, helpful how? The Q&A (Exhibit 4.14 hereto) essentially directs CitiFinancial staff to emphasize the drawbacks of Monthly Premium Credit Insurance, to say \"your payment may be higher due to a variety of reasons... whatever product(s) you currently have as Single Premium Credit Insurance will be the only products(s) you can change to Monthly Premium Insurance provided you still quality for those products... It will be necessary to complete an insurance applications.\" (Emphasis added). Significantly, the Answer to the Question \"Why can't I pay for my Home and Auto Security Plan or Safeguard on a monthly basis too?\" is \"Those products were not designed or priced for the fees or premiums to be paid on a monthly basis.\" (Emphasis added). So, CitiFinancial essentially discourages even real estate loan customers from switching from Single Premium Credit Insurance, and continues to offer ONLY single premium \"Home and Auto Security Plan\" and \"Safeguard\" insurance.\nFinally, for this submission, Exhibit 4.15 hereto is a \"CitiFinancial Interoffice Memorandum\" dated May 20, 2002, reporting \"Major\" and \"Significant\" errors in \"Lending Policy.\" It is ICP's position, based on the documentation submitted to date in this proceeding, that CitiFinancial's policies are in many instances predatory. Where even these policies are, by CitiFinancial's own recent admission, violated, the need for a formal evidentiary hearing, and to deny Citigroup's applications to expand, is clear.\nWhile, despite the FRB's own rules, Citigroup has yet to respond to ICP's June 3 comments and exhibits, Citigroup has made certain statements in the public record in recent days. The American Banker of June 24, 2002 (\"Too Much Information? Citi Mystery-Shop Sparks Debate,\" Page 17) reports: [snip]\nBut the memo, Exhibit 3 to ICP's June 3 submission, had nothing to do with \"enhancing [CitiFinancial's] confidence\" -- the memo was not distributed to customers, but to CitiFinancial \"District Managers and Branch staff.\" And the issue is not whether Citigroup had announced that it \"would start a mystery-shopping program\" at some point. In the memo, W.R. Miller states exactly when the \"Mystery Shopping Test\" will take place (\"in December and complete in January\") and what will be tested. In fact, stating when the \"Mystery Shopping Test\" will end seems less likely to \"ensure that [Citi's] policies were being followed\" than to implicitly instruct employees of when to comply with the law, and when to cease doing so.\nAlso, New York Newsday of June 23, 2002 (\"Taking Hispanics Into Account,\" Page F08) reports that ICP \"also notes that, according to government home mortgage statistics, Hispanics are denied prime loans far more than whites. [ICP] said Citigroup's denial rate to Hispanics is worse than the industry national average. Indeed. In New York, Citigroup denies Hispanics conventional loans almost 3.5 times more than whites, according to the 2000 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The industry average is 1.4 times. 'We, along with federal and enforcement agencies, do not believe that selective HMDA data give a complete picture of the lending process,' said spokesman Mark Rodgers of Citigroup.\" Newsday independently confirmed"}
{"text":" ICP's HMDA analysis; Citigroup's lending to Latinos is substantially more disparate that other lenders, even in Citigroup's headquarters MSA.\nFurther on the managerial and lack-of-standards issues ICP raised on June 3, 2002, and to which Citigroup has declined to timely respond: last week Citigroup (along with UBS and Credit Suisse) was sued in federal district court in Manhattan for having provided money to help support the South African apartheid regime. \"Were it not for the conspiracy of these financial institutions and companies, men, women, children and families would not have suffered from forced removals, forced labor, imprisonment, banishment, kidnapping, torture, disfigurement, murders, massacres, psychological trauma and terror,\" the suit says. A Citibank representative declined to comment to Bloomberg News. The FRB must inquire into this and the other adverse managerial issues [FN: Also last week, Citigroup dropped its appeal to a sex discrimination verdict against its U.K.-based securities arm. See, e.g., the Evening Standard (London), June 19, 2002. Combined with the Smith Barney sex discrimination case(s), the FRB must inquire into these issues as well] which ICP has timely raised in this proceeding.\nThe Board should schedule and hold a formal hearing (see supra), and, on the current record, Citigroup's applications should not be approved.\nUpdate of June 19, 2002: on June 14, the Office of Thrift Supervision telephoned ICP, responding to ICP's request for a formal meeting on Citibank FSB's applications to acquire Golden State Bancorp and Cal Fed Bank. The OTS has proposed July 8, 2002, as the date for the formal meeting; this was confirmed in an OTS letter dated June 18. ICP has now urged the Federal Reserve Board, to which Citi has also applied, to co-sponsor any OTS formal meeting. Developing...\nUpdate of June 17, 2002: ICP has submitted a third comment to the Federal Reserve Board, noting among other things that on June 11, Fed Governor Olson gave a speech about predatory lending, saying among other things that \"there is economic advantage and potential for abuse in the way [a loan] is priced.\" ICP has submitted a third comment, including concerning a recent sample CitiFinancial loan, which was dramatically overpriced as reflected by CitiFinancial's new offer a mere six months later:\nAn applicant from in Jefferson City, Tennessee, went to CitiFinancial for a home-secured loan earlier this year and was charged a 14.5% interest rate. CitiFinancial employee Roy Ogle told the customer that he had to agree to credit insurance in order to get the loan; only a month after loan closing did the customer get a letter saying that insurance is not required. The customer then applied elsewhere seeking a lower rate and was offered 8.4% by another (non-Citigroup) lender. CitiFinancial's Roy Ogle then telephoned offering him a refinance at a 10% fixed rate. This calls into question Citigroup's claim that CitiFinancial \"prices by risk\" -- it is difficult to understand any credible, across-the-board model resulting in a drop of 4.5 interest rate points is less than six months. Essentially, CitiFinancial charges applicants the absolute (and arbitrary) maximum it can gouge then for, then only drops the rate when another lender makes a lower offer. It would appear that under Fed Governor Olson's description of predatory lending, CitiFinancial is a predatory lender. In his speech Gov. Olson asked, regarding pricing, \"is it arbitrary or did you develop it according to some formula that is based on something other than somebody's individual judgment?\" The above-described CitiFinancial loan (and many of the other CitiFinancial loans regarding which ICP has submitted documents to the Fed opposing Citi's Golden State application) fail Governor Olson's -- and presumably the Federal Reserve Board's -- test. On June 11, ICP hand-delivered to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington originals of its June 3 and June 10 exhibits, which are described below in this Report.\nOn June 5, the New York Fed wrote to Citigroup's outside counsel stating that \"[i]f Citigroup wishes to respond... your comment should be received by us within eight business days of this letter; please provide a copy of your response directly to [ICP]... Please advise [the FRBNY] within three business days of the date of this letter whether you will be submitting any comments.\"\nTwo weeks after submitting its timely comments, ICP has received neither any response from Citigroup, nor notice of Citigroup's intent to respond. The Fed's comment period runs to July 5, 2002; the New York Fed's contact information is below in this Report.\nRE: Second timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications"}
{"text":" and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & Cal Fed & affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a second timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nICP submitted a detailed comment on June 3, 2002, to which Citigroup has yet to respond. On June 6 ICP received from Citigroup a portion of its application to the Federal Reserve (the \"FRB\"), and notes that this Application does not mention much less address or update the fact that the Federal Trade Commission is prosecuting a lawsuit against Citigroup for predatory lending, and has complained to the Court regarding Citigroup's lack of compliance with discovery orders in the case. Despite Citigroup's previous representations to the FRB and others regarding its purported subprime lending reforms, no update is provided. On the current record, a public meeting is necessary, and Citigroup's applications should not be approved.\nSince Citigroup has not addressed the issue in its hastily-prepared application (filed a mere 10 days after its announced its proposal to acquire Golden State), ICP has reviewed Citigroup's Web site in search of Citigroup presentations addressing these issues. Under the heading \"Citigroup on the Issues,\" Citigroup's web site provides updates dated August, October and December 2001 -- nothing in 2002. In the most detailed of the updates, Citigroup states inter alia that part of its reforms involves \"mystery shopping.\" However, ICP's initial comment included as Exhibit 3 a CitiFinancial Southeast Division Memorandum to all \"Region Managers\" (subsequently sent to all branch managers, as reflected on the handwritten note on the memo), informing them of the start and stop dates of the \"Mystery Shopping Test,\" and of the specifics of the test:\nThe memo's author, W.R. Miller, asked for confirmation that all branches had been informed, prior to the start of the \"Mystery\" shopping test. Clearly, this is NOT \"mystery\" shopping.\nThis memo was cc-ed to a higher-up in CitiFinancial, K.C. Mead, who took part in a November 27, 2001, investor meeting regarding CitiFinancial and along with Michael Knapp made a presentation about CitiFinancial's branch business. Thus, CitiFinancial at the highest levels knew that its Region and Branch managers were being given a heads-up and a cheat-sheet for the supposed \"Mystery\" Shopping Test.\nCitigroup's most lengthy update also makes claims that CitiFinancial's compensation system has been reviewed to make sure that it is not \"counter to the ['reform'] initiatives.\" However, ICP's initial comment, in Exhibit 1, presented a compensation print out for the first quarter of 2002 showing that branch managers' bonuses ride on how much credit insurance they can impose on loans including real estate loans.\nCitigroup also makes various claims about its \"Foreclosure initiative\" of reviewing certain ex-Associates loans. ICP has closely tracked one such loan, initially made by Associates' First Family \/ Allied Credit to [a customer] of Powell, Tennessee. The loan was taken out by a relative of [the customer], without her knowledge. Nevertheless, on January 26, 2001, CitiFinancial wrote to [the customer] \"welcoming\" her to CitiFinancial, and stating that \"nothing about your loan has changed.\" The customer continued to contest the loan, but CitiFinancial kept demanding and receiving payments. Suddenly, on March 26, 2002, Kim Van Airsdale, CitiFinancial's Manager of Foreclosure\/REO in Baltimore, directed branch manager David Johansen to \"suspend foreclosure\" and \"pay off the account\" in full. Ms. Van Airsdale's \"privileged and confidential memo\" informs Mr. Johansen that \"though it is not necessary to obtain permission for this plan from the borrower, the designee should attempt to convey our intentions to the borrower.\"\nOn April 4, 2002, the customer went to CitiFinancial's office. She had not yet received notification of the plan; she offered to make a payment, and asked to see her file. She was told that her file was not available, and Mr. Johansen indicated a willingness to accept her payment. Subsequently, she was told that the loan was being forgiven \"because you're sick.\" According to sources, district manager Nancy Neel was present -- in fact, Ms. Neel was in charge of this loan through much of its payment history, as she has worked at Associates prior to its acquisition by Citigroup. The customer asked, \"what about the money I've paid you on the loan?\" No offer has been made to refund that money."}
{"text":" Note that CitiFinancial accepted at least $1,100 in payments on this loan.\nLast week, the customer went to the CitiFinancial office again and requested her documents. Mr. Johansen pulled out a 3-inch thick file but only gave the customer eight pages, none of which related to her payment history. The customer telephoned District Manager Nancy Neel and was told that she is not entitled to a copy of her payment history. The customer then telephoned customer service in Texas and spoke to a Clint Robinson. The note provided to the customer shows the check being paid to Wells Trucking Co., but on her original it shows her as getting the money. She never got it. Other documents in the case show that an employee of First Family forged the customer's signature to a $1,150 personal loan that was made so they could make a payment. (Documents regarding this case are annexed hereto as Exhibit 2.7).\nFurther documents annexed to this second timely comment include:\n--a CitiFinancial \"Rocopoly\" chart, further evidencing the compensation scheme at CitiFinancial wherein insurance premiums imposed on loans including real estate loans form the basis of \"payouts\" to CitiFinancial employees (Exhibit 2.1);\n--a CitiFinancial memo stating that \"[e]very employee in the branch will call the 'Opportunity' (default) worklists 'JUST TWO' hours everyday... they have to be different than the last attempt (i.e. home\/job, job\/reference, job\/home)\" (Exhibit 2.2, emphasis added);\n--a series of February 11, 2002, e-mails among CitiFinancial's David Baer, Nancy Neel, Tom Palmatary, Richard Taylor and a CitiFinancial outside counsel regarding \"Hines v. First Family et al.\" including a list of 27 properties to be \"quit claimed back to Weston Tucker\" (Exhibit 2.3) -- note that Citigroup has not submitted into the record any update of the predatory lending litigation pending against it;\n--a series of April 30, 2002, e-mail among many of the same parties including higher-ups Ed Starkey, Peter Schaaf and Dave Roberts, regarding a \"Non-Conforming Identification Process\" in which CitiFinancial is only now \"identify[ing] and label[ing] non-conforming acquisition accounts in the Maestro \/ Action system\" (Exhibit 2.4). The accompanying CitiFinancial estimates that each branch will have \"between 50 and 100\" such accounts, including mobile homes, \"rentals,\" \"LTVs over 100%,\" etc. -- note that this is nearly a year and a half after Citigroup acquired The Associates.\nICP will be submitting further comments; we formally ask that Citigroup be required to submit its response to ICP's June 3 comment within, at most, eight business days thereof -- that is, during the comment period so that ICP has an opportunity to reply. Unless the FRB dismisses Citigroup's applications (as ICP is requesting), the FRB should schedule a hearing at the earliest possible time, perhaps in conjunction with the Office of Thrift Supervision, to which Citigroup has also applied and to which ICP has also submitted a timely request for a formal meeting \/ hearing.\nInner City Press\/Community on the Move\n& Fair Finance Watch\ncc: Office of Thrift Supervision, West Region\nAttn: Regional Director Charles Deardorff, et al.\n2001 Junipero Serra Boulevard, Suite 650\nDaly City, California 94014-1976\nWashington, DC 20551 [By Fax]\nRE: Timely comment in opposition to, and requesting a hearing on, Citigroup's applications and notices to acquire Golden State Bancorp & California Federal Bank and their affiliates\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, including the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the applications and notices of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its affiliates, \"Citigroup\") to acquire Golden State Bancorp and its affiliates, including Cal Fed Bank (collectively, \"Golden State\").\nICP has become increasingly concerned with apparent predatory lending practices at Citigroup's high-rate \"subprime\" lender CitiFinancial. Throughout 2002, current and former CitiFinancial employees have provided ICP with documents indicating pervasive anti-consumer practices at the company, including interest rates over 20%, property lists taken only in order to impose credit insurance, cynical \"heads-up\" messages sent to employees prior to purported \"Mystery Shopping\" tests, etc.. Each of these will be discussed below, and is documented in the attachments to the Comment. ICP timely requests a hearing on Citigroup's practices and on this $5.8 billion acquisition proposal, which is subject to the Community Reinvest"}
{"text":"ment Act, 12 U.S.C. \ufffd2801, et seq. (\"CRA\").\nUnder the CRA, the records of fairness by Citigroup's lenders must be considered in connection with this expansion proposal. Additionally, this proposal would subject yet more consumers to the Citigroup practices documented below and in the exhibits. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the compliance including consumer compliance records of Citigroup's affiliates must be considered.\nDisparities in Citigroup's prime lenders' 2000 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") data and 2001 Loan Application Registers (\"LARs\") are analyzed infra in Section II. Section I describes CitiFinancial's actual current practices, as opposed to the theoretical practices alluded to in Citigroup's various vague reform announcements.\nI. CitiFinancial's Problematic (\"Predatory\") Practices\nDespite Citigroup's purported reforms regarding credit insurance, ICP has received documentation that CitiFinancial managers' bonuses still ride on \"premium per loan\" imposed on real estate and other loans. See Exhibit 1 hereto: on a quarterly basis, points are awarded in eleven different categories. If a total of sixty points is not reached, no bonus is given. Imposing credit insurance accounts for fully 30 points, broken down into credit insurance on personal loans, on real estate loans, on \"Equity Plus\" loans and a category referred to as \"Non credit.\" Branches, Districts, Regions and Divisions are all judged (and compensated) based on how much credit (and non-credit) insurance is sold.\nExhibit 2 hereto, a document CitiFinancial refers to as the \"Shelf Space Report,\" demonstrates that for the CitiFinancial District in question, the average size of personal loans was $6,279, approximately 20% of which constituted payments for insurance. Given the way Citigroup compensates its employees, insurance packing should come as no surprise.\nIn fact, CitiFinancial does it best to avoid surprises, including by informing employees in advance of the specifics of the purported \"mystery shops\" that Citi has presented as a safeguard against predatory lending. Exhibit 3 hereto is a memorandum to CitiFinancial's Southeast Division from Division leader Wendell R. Miller. In the memo, Mr. Miller tells all branch staff when to be expecting (and to be prepared for) the \"mystery shopping test\" that Citigroup had told its regulators would be performed. The dates of the \"mystery\" shop are specified, as well as what will be tested for: \"do we quote the same rates, LTV, etc.\" The implication is, be sure to keep the offers consistent during the duration of the test. The ending date of the \"mystery\" shopping is also specified. The memo was cc-ed to Tim Baechtold, Division Operations Manager, and to K.C. Mead and Ed Starkey.\nExhibit 15 hereto documents a loan made earlier this year (March 15, 2002) by CitiFinancial at 25.33% interest. To borrow $12,316.02, the customer pays $9,518.58 in finance charges, and $1,140.61 for credit disability insurance, single premium. The collateral is a 1994 Dodge Caravan -- it is dubious that this eight year old vehicle is worth $12,000. But CitiFinancial's purpose in assembling property lists on consumer loans is to write credit insurance.\nExhibit 12 hereto is a CitiFinancial property list reflecting credit insurance on such items as random audio and video tapes. Exhibit 13 hereto is a CitiFinancial property list from the Maestro computer system reflecting credit insurance on such items as an ice chest and fishing rods.\nICP raised the absurdity and presumptive predatory nature of this practice -- selling credit insurance on items such as ice chests on which CitiFinancial would never foreclose or repossess -- directly to Citigroup's CEO at Citigroup's April 16, 2002, shareholders' meeting. Citigroup's CEO declined to respond to that part of ICP's question(s); Citigroup must be required to address and attempt to justify these practices in this application proceeding.\nWhat we are seeing is that the \"reforms\" that CitiFinancial has announced are not being implemented, or are much less meaningful that Citigroup has claimed. Citigroup stated with fanfare that it was discontinuing single premium credit insurance -- on real estate loans. But such insurance and \"ancillary products\" continue on CitiFinancial's many personal loans; employees are still in February 2002 being directed to present customers with loans with loan to value ration \"maxed-out,\" and hurdles are thrown up to prevent customers refinancing with other lenders are more favorable terms.\nDespite Citigroup's \"pledge\" that applicants with prime credit histories would be given prime-rate loans, Exhibit 4 hereto reflects that at CitiFinancial, applicants with \"Excellent\" credit profiles are charged 18.99% interest -- on loans that are secured by the borrower's"}
{"text":" home.\nExhibit 5 hereto is a memo from CitiFinancial Regional Manager David Baer dated February 25, 2002, instructing District Managers that CitiFinancial's \"policy is that all R[eal] E[state] loans are presented to customers at max[imum] L[oan] T[o] V[alue ratio]. If the branch cannot sell you get involved... If you cannot sell Joe or myself must be involved.. Make it happen.\" Sources indicate increasing pressure to make the largest loans possible to customers -- so that no equity without a lien on it remains in the customer's house. This is also a way to deter customers from refinancing with other lenders at lower rates.\nExhibit 14 hereto is a print-out from CitiFinancial Maesto computer system reflecting the type of \"field call\" which is supposedly no longer taking place at CitiFinancial. Next to the date 2\/20\/02, the notation is made: \"Need to go by his house.\" Source indicate that harassing \"field calls\" continue to this date, often mischaracterized as \"inspections of collateral.\" The extent of field calls is documentable through employees' \"mileage reports.\" Source indicate that Chattanooga CitiFinancial manager Carter Payne continues to do these money-collecting \"field calls,\" and that an investigator who Citigroup sent down to Tennessee in response to questions ICP has raised, Keith Black, spoke only with CitiFinancial district managers Jim Chakales and Nancy Neel, and employees May Maughn and Freda Monday, but that Mr. Black \"wasn't concerned with the violations relayed in [ICP's] article but was concerned about how [ICP] got it.\" As was initially the case in South Carolina last year (see below), it seems more like a cover-up, or an attempt to plug leaks rather than reform practices.\nExhibit 6 hereto is a print-out from CitiFinancial's Maestro computer system reflecting an attempt on March 21, 2002, to \"upsell to $7,500 on personal loans but he only wanted the $5,000. And had received mail solicitation for payment of $129.68, that's what he wanted.\"\nExhibit 7 hereto documents a CitiFinancial loan on March 22, 2002; the [customers] end up with a $631.23 payment for Joint Credit Life, and a $1,261.20 payment for Joint Credit Disability. All this for a loan for under $7,000, at an interest rate of 27.59%.\nExhibit 8 hereto documents a CitiFinancial branch manager on March 20, 2002, asking for approval to raise a customer's interest rate from 18.99% to 20.99%, in exchange for a \"new advance\" of a mere $700.\nOther Sample CitiFinancial Loans\n[Customers] applied for a $66,000 mortgage from CitiFinancial's office on Clinton Highway in Knoxville, Tennessee. They were told that no loan would be issued without them also taking out credit insurance. Due to the insurance packed in to the loan, after twelve on-time payment, their pay-off amount grew to $72,000. CitiFinancial's 1-800 customer service number was told of this, but nothing was done. A print-out from CitiFinancial's \"Maestro\" computer system regarding this account are attached as Exhibit 9 hereto. These print-outs indicate that when the customers sought to payoff their loan and refinance with another company, CitiFinancial staff \"could not reason with her... called customer adv[ising] her she would be paying broker fees, appraisal fees, points and so forth. She does not care, says she is getting a lower payment and getting life insurance too... I tried to talk her out of this...\" The next day it is noted, under the rubric \"Sales Offer: Save a payoff\" that the customer was \"in office requesting all insurance be cancelled on her loan. Claims she was advised by someone to do this.\"\nAnother CitiFinancial customer... of Bulls Gap, Tennessee, had $14,000 of insurance packed in to a $33,000 loan. He was told that he had to take the insurance in order to get the loan. CitiFinancial's District Manager was told of this, and yet nothing was done.\nA customer of CitiFinancial's West Knoxville office... had $14,000 of insurance packed in to a $42,000 loan. When she sought to cancel the insurance, she was first told that it was not possible. Then, after she persisted, she was given a handwritten receipt. Only after further complaints was she given a computer print-out proving that the insurance was cancelled.\nAt CitiFinancial's Oak Ridge office, [a] customer... applied when she was 65 years old. But CitiFinancial filled out her insurance forms stating that she was 61. Complaints were made,"}
{"text":" but American Health & Life never investigated; nor did Citigroup.\nAt the West Knoxville office, CitiFinancial's branch manager arranged for a friend of his to sell a pick-up truck to [a] CitiFinancial borrower... The truck quickly broke down, but the (CitiFinancial) loan is still due. The transactions involve using a CitiFinancial personal loan to pay off another CitiFinancial loan, i.e., flipping.\nCustomer... her husband applied for a loan through a CitiFinancial office in Knoxville. [The husband] was and is being treated for a heart condition. The insurance form requires an answer regarding pre-existing health conditions. The [customers] were told to leave this blank, and were charged for insurance, rolled into the loan. When they sought a copy of the final version of their documents, they found that CitiFinancial had subsequently checked the box, \"no heart condition,\" and sent the form to American Health & Life. Inquiries were made, but no actions were taken.\nThe branch manager of CitiFinancial's West Knoxville office put over $7,000 worth of insurance on a loan to [a customer. The customer] had initially been offered an 8.5% rate by the CitiFinancial district manager. But when he went to sign documents the rate was raised to 9.9%. The district manager stated that this was due to \"the appraisal coming in low\" -- but at the time the district manager offered 8.5%, CitiFinancial's lowest rate for this type of loan was 9.9%. [The customer] was not told about the insurance until the day of closing and was not told it was optional.\n[Another customer] got a mortgage from CitiFinancial's Crossville, Tennessee office and was sold insurance for which she did not qualify, due to a health condition. She did not answer the health question on her insurance form -- but someone in the CitiFinancial office did, on their copy. When she was refinancing her mortgage the Crossville office was called about a lien which was recorded in July of 2001 by that same CitiFinancial office. [The customer] had rescinded but they never released the lien. When [the customer] fell behind she told them she was refinancing her mortgage but they continued to call her and threaten her with foreclosure. The CitiFinancial district manager Bill Bonds was called and informed, but did nothing about the threats or insurance fraud.\nThe transactions described above, and documented in the Exhibits hereto, did not take place in offices that Citigroup acquired along with Associates First Capital Corporation -- these were Commercial Credit offices, owned by Travelers; since Travelers acquired Citicorp, they have been CitiFinancial offices. Complaints about forgery on insurance documents, about illegal insurance packing, etc., have been directed to district managers, regional managers, and the so-called \"home office,\" via its 1-800 toll free complaint number. And yet nothing has happened; nothing has changed or improved.\nThe irregularities extend to efforts to artificially under-report delinquencies on loans. For example, a CitiFinancial employee in Tennessee named Jack Lay was found to be using his own money to make partial payment in order to advance customers' due dates and thereby conceal delinquencies; more systematically, loans are deemed non-delinquent due to a so-called \"tornado deferment,\" regardless of the weather.\nExhibit 11 hereto is a CitiFinancial audit which found a variety of errors and worse:\n\"The first mortgage balance of $69,500 was falsified and lowered to $46,000 during the verification process in order to lower the loan-to-value (LTV). As a result, the recalculated LTV of 107% exceeded the maximum approved LTV of 80%.\" (Holland)\n\"Income used to qualify the loan was not verified. Based on the verified income the recalculated ability-to-pay (ATP) of 23% (Springer) and 21% (Childress) is below the minimum requirement.\"\n\"The loan did not adhere to Tennessee state regulations, as the $150 title search fee and points were charged to the borrower.\"\n\"The following RESPA requirements were not adhered to: the title search fee or the title insurance was not disclosed on the Settlement Statement. The points were not disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate. There was no evidence the branch provided a copy of the Customer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages to the borrowers. It was determined that the branch does not stock the handbook. The Section 32 Mortgage Disclosure form was not in the file.\"\n\"Our review of fourteen accounts with waived late charges noted twelve instances where the branch waived late charges when payments were made or issued a disbursement from the income account (INC55) and posted it to the account in order to advance the paid-to-dates. A distortion of delinquencies is considered to have"}
{"text":" occurred, as the accounts would have been carried past due.\"\nThere appears to be systemic under-reporting of delinquency at CitiFinancial. Pressure is brought to bear on loan officers to make a minimum of 20 loans a month. When some of these loans fall into delinquency, this is cured by issuing new loans (i.e., flipping), or by advancing the payment-due date, sometimes by making a payment as small as five dollars.\nThese practices are systemic, and systematized, at CitiFinancial nationwide. In CitiFinancial's \"Maestro\" computer system, there is a so-called \"Upsell Challenge List,\" of CitiFinancial personal loan customers who should be solicited to take out mortgages, often in the form of so-called \"Equity Plus\" loans, the blended interest rates on which are kept a half percentage point below the triggers of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, HOEPA. Disclosure forms, under RESPA and otherwise, that are required to be signed by borrowers are often forged and back-dated.\nFor the record, in the FTC's ongoing litigation against CitiFinancial for predatory lending (See Federal Trade Commission v. Citigroup, Inc., et al., Civil No. 010 CV 0606 (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, filed March 6, 2001), on March 5, 2002, the FTC filed a detailed motion and an affidavit by Michele V. Handzel, who worked at CitiFinancial for a year following Citi's acquisition of Associates. Among other things, Ms. Handzel states:\nAfter September 2001, using the [Debt Relief Plan] on Maestro made it easier to me and other employees to automatically include credit insurance in the proposed monthly payment quote. We no longer had to manually calculate how much credit insurance could be slid into the loan without exceeding the proposed monthly payment; Maestro automatically performed this calculation... CitiFinancial put much more pressure on employees than Associates did to include as many credit insurance products and ancillary products as possible on every loan... Branch Managers, such as myself, were required to come in during loan closings if a branch employee was having trouble selling the insurance... Collections practices were more aggressive at CitiFinancial than at The Associates. CitiFinancial had a policy whereby loans were charged-off after two months of delinquency, rather than six months like at The Associates. Thus, there was a greater urgency to collect on a delinquent account before having to charge it off. Consequently, this policy also results in more flipping because the company did not want to lose the accounts and the profits generated by those accounts to a charge-off.... [W]e were given a mouse pad which we were required to keep on our desks near our computers. The mouse pad contained instructions on how to automatically include credit insurance on loans when soliciting customers over the phone... CitiFinancial instructed us to remove the mouse pads from our desk when banking examiners came to audit my branch in May 2001.\nIt is important to note Ms. Handzel's statements about CitiFinancial practices that are even more anti-consumer than Associates' were. The last above-quoted statement -- that \"CitiFinancial instructed us to remove the mouse pads from our desk when banking examiners came to audit... in May 2001\" -- raises troubling questions. The Federal Reserve Board in mid-2001 announced in its Citigroup - EAB order that it would be conducting an on-site examination of CitiFinancial. There is now sworn testimony that CitiFinancial attempted to defraud the examiners. This must be addressed in this proceeding. Given that the Federal Reserve is in charge of supervising CitiFinancial, as BHC subsidiary, and has committed to examine CitiFinancial, it is important to note Citigroup's response to the FTC's March 5, 2002, motion: Citigroup claims that it should not have to produce documents relation to \"CitiFinancial's sales training, advertising and loan solicitation practices, and employee compensation\" (FTC Requests 62-66), arguing that these \"are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\" But such information is directly relevant to the FRB's supervisory duties, and to the FRB's statements regarding CitiFinancial in the 2001 Citi-EAB Order.\nIn 2001, ICP looked closely at CitiFinancial's practices in South Carolina, including the forgery of documents, the flipping of loans, and, perhaps most outrageously, CitiFinancial's gagging of its employees. See, e.g, \"Citigroup Hires Prominent Lawyer in Loan Abuse Case,\" Reuters, July 27, 2001; \"Citi Corroborates Two Allegations,\" American Banker, July 30, 2001). To ICP's knowledge, the Federal Reserve has yet to act on the troubling matter of CitiFinancial gagging its own employees: intimidating them from speaking to regulatory authorities and examiners.\nFollowing"}
{"text":" the raising of some of these issues, the FRB in its Citigroup - EAB Order of July 2, 2001, stated that:\nthe Board will conduct a thorough examination to assess the effectiveness of that implementation at Citigroup's subprime affiliates, CitiFinancial and CitiFinancial Mortgage... The Board also will consider any information gathered in these reports or the examination in reviewing future proposals by Citigroup...\nFive months following the above-quoted Fed statement (that the FRS \"will conduct a thorough examination\"), Citigroup on December 14, 2001, wrote to the FDIC that\nthe Federal Reserve Board required, as a condition of its [EAB] approval, an examination of CitiFinancial, to confirm implementation of the progressive lending initiatives adopted by CitiFinancial in connection with its acquisition of Associates. That examination should not delay these applications, however, as suggested by ICP... The Federal Reserve Board will conduct that examination and take action following that examination as appropriate. (Emphasis added).\nFrom this phrasing, in a December 14, 2001, letter from Citigroup's Carl Howard to the FDIC, it appears that the Fed had still not completed the examination of CitiFinancial, five months after it was announced in mid-2001 as a \"condition\" for the FRB to approve Citi-EAB. The exam must be completed, and the results disclosed and comment allowed thereon, in this Citi-Golden State proceeding. ICP is formally requesting that the FRB deny Citigroup's expansion application; it is important to note that the FRB denied a Shawmut Bank application in New Hampshire, while a Department of Justice investigation of Shawmut's lending was pending. Shawmut National Corporation, Order Disapproving Acquisition of a Bank and Formation of a Bank Holding Company, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 47 (January, 1994). Here, Citigroup has been sued for predatory lending by the FTC; even beyond that pending suit, the adverse issues raised above and documented in the Exhibits hereto militate for a hearing on, and denial of, Citigroup applications. If Citigroup were allowed to acquire Golden State -- which ICP opposes -- many more consumers would be subjected to the practices described above. Citigroup has stated its intention to expand CitiFinancial in Mexico and in the Latino community more generally, including through this proposal.\nII. DISPARITIES IN CITIGROUP'S 2000 HMDA and 2001 LARs\nThe most recent publicly available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") data is for 2000. In this section, ICP timely enters into the record disparities in Citigroup's 2000 lending, as reflected by HMDA data. ICP has also obtained from Citigroup certain of its 2001 Loan Application Registers (\"LARs\"). ICP has begun analyzing these Citigroup LARs, with particular reference to the presumptively predatory practices described above. First:\nIn 2000 in the New York City Metropolitan Statistical Area (\"MSA\"), for conventional home purchase loans, Citibank, N.A. denied loan applications from African Americans more than five times more frequently than applications from whites. Citibank denied Latinos 3.5 times more frequently than whites. This is much worse than other lenders in this MSA: the denial rate disparities for the industry as a whole in 2000 were 2.20 for African Americans, and 1.97 for Latinos.[snip - contact ICP for more recent data]\nCitigroup is also deeply involved in questionable subprime lending through its investment banking operation. For example, Salomon Brothers Realty Corp. has provided a $100 million repurchase line of credit to Long Beach Mortgage -- a subprime lender that was sued by the Department of Justice of race discrimination and pricing disparity grounds. Salomon Brothers Realty Corp. provided warehouse lines of credit of $775 million to subprime lender New Century Mortgage Corporation (\"New Century\"), requiring New Century either to securitize $1 billion of loans through Salomon Smith Barney as sole underwriter, or, in the alternative, to sell $1 billion in loans to Salomon Brothers Mortgage Securities VII for their own securitization.\nSalomon Smith Barney has been the underwriter for the subprime mortgage backed securities issuances of Centex Home Equity. What standards do SSB and Citigroup have for working with subprime lenders? Apparently none. Citigroup has previously sought \"confidential treatment\" for even the names of the subprime lenders with which it does business. The FRB should obtain and release this list, and hold the requested hearings.\nIII. OTHER ADVERSE CITIGROUP ISSUES WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED\nBeyond the above-sketched CRA and fair lending matters, there are a number of important managerial and compliance issues into which the Federal Reserve must inquire, in this proceeding. These include Citigroup's transactions with Enron (and Dynegy, see infra); the developing \"analyst\" scandal (regardless of Citigroup's jumping"}

In reverse order: see, e.g., Reuters of May 22, 2002 (\"Did Investors Get Tipped on Golden State Merger?\"). See also, Indian Express Online Media's Financial Express of May 29, 2002, \"SEBI to Look into Violations of Insider Trading Norms in Polaris Merger Case:\" \"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has decided to look into the matter of possible insider trading in the case of merger of Polaris Software Laboratories Ltd (PSLL) with a Citigroup company Orbitech Solutions Ltd..\" Emphasis added.\nDespite Citigroup's hiring of ex-Federal Reserve anti-money laundering specialist, it is not clear that Citigroup has sufficient safeguards in place (as must be reviewed in connection with this BHC Act application, under the USA Patriot Act). For the record, and in order to trigger the requisite review in this proceeding, the Financial Times reported on November 29, 2001, that \"U.S. investigators believe about half the $500,000 that the hijackers spent on the September 11 plot was sent by Mustafa Ahmad, who is today regarded by investigators as bin Laden's finance chief, via Dubai money exchanges through Citibank in New York and on to Florida.\" See also, Wall Street Journal of November 9, 2001: \"About $110,000 in transfers from Dubai to two of the hijackers involved in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington moved from an exchange house in the U.A.E. via Citibank in New York to the hijackers' joint account at SunTrust.\" See also, the (London) Independent of 11\/20\/01, which reported that Ramzi Muhammad Abdullah bin al-Shibh (who features prominently in the recently-released indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui) \"transferred $2,200 (pounds 1,500) from his account at Citibank in Hamburg to a Florida bank on 15 August.\" (Interestingly, this transfer from a Citibank branch does not figure in the Moussaoui indictment). The FRB must inquire into the sufficiency of anti-money laundering controls at Citigroup, under the terms of the BHC Act and the USA Patriot Act, in this proceeding...\nUnder the explicit \"managerial resources\" factor of the Bank Holding Company Act, and in light of the FRB's duties under the principles promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the FRB must inquire into each of these managerial and compliance issues, as well as the predatory lending and CRA issues with which ICP began this Comment, before even considering allowing Citigroup to acquire Golden State and further expand, subjecting more people to Citigroup's practices.\nFor the reasons set forth above, the FRB should schedule and hold a public hearing on these applications, and, on the current record, the Board should deny the applications.\nNOTE: This page will be updated. For or with more information, contact us.\nCiti- Sears\nOn August 4, 2003, Inner City Press \/ Community on the Move and its Fair Finance Watch (ICP) filed comments opposing Citigroup's applications to acquire Sears, Roebuck & Company's financial services business. Throughout 2003, ICP has been compiling evidence of continued predatory lending by Citigroup's CitiFinancial; ICP has submitted exhibits to the regulators in this regard. ICP's comments analyze Citigroup's mortgage lending in 2002, data for which became available only on August 1, 2003. The 2002 HMDA analysis is followed by evidence that Citigroup remains a predatory lender, that it is increasingly exporting the worst of its predatory practices, and its lax compliance practices, as evidenced by its only-recently-half-settled involvements with Enron and Dynegy, its still not sufficiently reformed self-serving investment advice, its lax anti-money laundering controls (most recently in Nigeria), its lack of human rights standards (the example ICP gives involve Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), etc.. A summary of some of the points in the protest follow; see also, \"Group Seeks to Scuttle Sears, Citibank Deal,\" by Kelly Quigley, Crain's Chicago Business, August 6, 2003; \"Group Seeks to Scuttle Sears, Citibank Deal,\" Washington Times (UPI), August 6, 2003; \"Sears, Citigroup merger challenged,\" Chicago Daily Herald August 5, 2003, Pg. 3; \"Group Opposes Sears, Citigroup Credit Card Deal,\" Consumer Financial Services Law Report, August 28, 2003.\nUpdate of October 27, 2003: Inner City Press, having in early August commented on and against Citigroup's application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to acquire Sears' credit cards and financial services"}
{"text":" business, received by mail the OCC's approval order. On the issues raised, the OCC's order -- actually, it's just a nine-page letter from the OCC's Licensing Manager for large or \"multi-national\" banks -- is woefully inadequate. Citigroup, which only recently settled charges of predatory lending, has stated it will market subprime loans to Sears' customer base. But the OCC argues that \"many of the concerns raised dealt with Citigroup entities that are not parties to this transaction, are non-bank subsidiaries of Citigroup, or are institutions regulated by other federal agencies... The OCC has no regulatory or supervisory authority over any of the Citigroup entities mentioned by the commenters that conduct subprime lending, such as CitiFinancial Credit Company, because none of these entities are national bank or subsidiaries of national banks.\"\nPshaw. Citigroup has said it will market CitiFinancial's products to the customers of Sears National Bank -- so the argument that CitiFinancial is not \"a party to the transaction\" is a weak legalism. And while the OCC may not be the examiner of CitiFinancial, if the effect of a Bank Merger Act proposal before the OCC is to expose customers of the target national bank to products from a company widely alleged -- including by government authorities -- to be predatory, the OCC must act on this.\nThe OCC's staged disempowerment is particularly strange given the Comptroller's current campaign of preempting state anti-predatory lending laws. To be seeking to occupy the field of regulation, and then refusing to regulate, is a contradiction which is harming consumers... Until next time, for or with more information, contact us.\nUpdate of October 20, 2003: last Thursday, October 16, Sears (not Citigroup) put out a press release saying that the OCC had approved the application. ICP immediately submitted a request, under FOIA and otherwise, to the OCC for a copy of the approval documents. Nothing, however, has yet been received. When it is, it will be reported and analyzed here. How very transparent...\nUpdate of September 8, 2003: While the OCC has apparently still not asked Citigroup the type of questions other regulators routinely ask applicants, ICP submitted the following to the Illinois Insurance Department on September 8:\n\"Under cover letter dated August 25, 2003, ICP received a copy of a Form A application by Citigroup's counsel, dated August 4, 2003. It refers to an exemption request dated July 27, 2003 -- a copy of which ICP still does not have, despite its requests since August 4. A copy of the exemption request should be provided forthwith to ICP; it should not be ruled on, other than denied, until that happens, and ICP can be heard.\n\"Under cover letter dated August 28, 2003, ICP received certain exhibits to Citigroup's Form A. However, the affidavits provided are not of Citigroup's board of directors. In fact, the August 4 Form A states, under required Item 3, that \"affidavits in the form designated in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 913 Illustration 1 will be filed as soon as they are available.\" Apparently, as of August 28 they had not been filed. Given the corporate scandals surrounding Citigroup and its board of directors (Enron, WorldCom, conflicted analyst advice, etc.), the requirements of biographical affidavits, etc., should NOT be waived. ICP will await receipt of the July 27 exemption request (which should be denied), and of the required biographical affidavits from Citigroup's directors.\"\nCitiFinancial's predatory lending was on the CBS Evening News on September 5....\nUpdate of September 1, 2003: on August 29 we received Citigroup's much-delayed response to our comments of August 4, on Citi-Sears. Citi's response tries to argue that the predatory lending issues raised are \"not related to the parties or the transaction.\" Meanwhile Citi reiterates that it would expand marketing of \"insurance as well as consumer finance products and services\" to Sears' customers.\nCiti also states that it \"does not provide public comments on matters that are the subject of litigation.\" Fine, then -- the OCC should simply deny Citi's applications until Citi is prepared to respond on relevant matters timely raised.

{"text":" later. I have faxed them the copy of the wire confirmation, I've sent faxes, I've called numerous times, and no one will return my call or help me. I recently had applied for a home equity line after this loan was supposedly \"paid off\" and will not get this loan now. I have never been through an experience such as this and I'm beyond frustration. How can a company like this stay in business?!\nIt's called... campaign contributions! As to the business that Citi does through third parties, subprime and otherwise, Citi responds that it \"review[s] resumes of principles of all third-party originators\" (Resp. at 11). Rather than explain its basis for continuing to do business with the questionable subprime lenders ICP has named, Citi responds with generalities such as this. Somehow we doubt that a resume or c.v. would be the best source for potentially adverse information... For with more information, contact us.\nUpdate of August 25, 2003: Citigroup and Sears do not even agree on what loans would be sold, or what the premium would be (see American Banker of August 21, at 5) -- and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency either doesn't have, or hasn't released, this information. Nor has Citigroup submitted any substantive response yet. So ICP has requested an extension of the comment period from the OCC...\nUpdate of August 18, 2003: In this Citigroup - Sears proceeding, ICP has just submitted to the OCC and the Illinois Insurance Department documentation of a sample CitiFinancial loan. The customer, who has authorized ICP to name her, is Betty Arnold. She and her husband Benny got a $140,013.60 loan from CitiFinancial on their marital residence. The CitiFinancial loan officer was Jack Lay -- he insisted on filling out the applications, including the insurance forms, himself. While the Arnolds disclosed that Benny had a heart condition, Jack Lay check off the \"no prior condition\" box on the insurance forms.\nWe have previously demonstrated, including in the exhibits to our first timely comment in this proceeding, that Citigroup pays CitiFinancial employees bonuses based on how much credit insurance they sell. This creates an incentive not only to hard-sell the insurance, but also to mis-fill out forms, as took place in this case.\nBenny Arnold subsequently died of an aneurysm -- but Citigroup's American Health & Life Insurance Company refused to pay on the policy, despite the fact that the Arnolds had fully disclosed all prior conditions in the course of applying for and obtaining the loan and insurance.\nCitigroup has had the opportunity to correct this outrage -- ICP has in its possession internal CitiFinancial documents reflecting their awareness of this loan and these issues, and that documentation has been made available to Citigroup and its outside counsel -- and still, the widow Mrs. Arnold faces foreclosure. All of these fact are attested to in the attachments we have now submitted to the OCC and Illinois Insurance Department -- along with Mrs. Arnold's phone numbers. So we'll see...\nUpdate of August 11, 2003: while we await Citigroup's response, we've learned that Citi has been arguing to the Illinois Insurance Department that no application should be required, to acquire Sears Life Insurance Company, because insurance is \"an insignificant part\" -- the full language of the statute is \"its insurance business either directly or through its affiliates is an insignificant portion of its total business.\" This seems strange, that the larger a conglomerate (and therefore the smaller a part its insurance business is), the less scrutiny would be given. We've requested all documents from the Illinois Insurance Department. For or with more information, contact us.\nPETITION TO DENY AND HEARING REQUEST BY INNER CITY PRESS \/ COMMUNITY ON THE MOVE AND THE FAIR FINANCE WATCH IN OPPOSITION TO THE APPLICATION OF CITIGROUP TO ACQUIRE SEARS, ROEBUCK & COMPANY'S FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS\nOn behalf of Inner City Press\/Community on the Move and its members and affiliates, and of the Fair Finance Watch (collectively, \"ICP\"), this is a timely comment opposing and requesting hearings on the application of Citigroup, Inc. (along with its subsidiaries, including its national banks and the subprime lender CitiFinancial, \"Citi\") to acquire the financial services business of Sears, Roebuck & Company (\"Sears\").\nCitigroup, a conglomerate already extensively involved in questionable subprime (high interest rate) lending, here seeks to gain access to more than 23 million more consumers, to whom it would market its home equity lines and installment loans, regarding which Citigroup has a recent and still pending predatory lending settlement. Beyond the foreseeable anti-competitive impacts (\"The deal will increase Citigroup's card portfolio to about $ 170 billion and solidify its market-leader position -- far ahead of No."}
{"text":" 2 card issuer MBNA, which had a $ 107 billion portfolio at the end of last year,\" USA Today, July 16, 2003), as reflected in the just-released 2002 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") data, Citigroup's normal interest rate lenders disproportionately deny and exclude Latinos and African Americans, while Citigroup steers these groups to its high-rate subprime units, including CitiFinancial. Since Citigroup chief operating officer, in announcing the deal, made much of Sears' \"eighteen percent Latino customer base,\" (specifically, he said that \"eighteen percent of the Sears customer base is Hispanic\"), questions are raised about targeting protected classes with predatory financial products: questions that militate for public hearings, and for the denial of Citigroup's applications.\nThat it is Citigroup's intention to market home equity loans to Sears' credit card customer is clear: see, for example, Securities Data Publishing's Asset Securitization Report of July 21, 2003, that Citigroup \"hopes to cross-market various other consumer loan products, such as home equity loans to current Sears credit card holders.\" The American Banker of July 21, 2003, describes a broader range of Citigroup products to be pitched: \"mortgages and home equity lines to installment loans.\" It was only in September 2002 that the Federal Trade Commission announced a proposed $240 million settlement with Citigroup, for predatory lending. The settlement, which numerous CitiFinancial customers have attacked as unfair and abusive -- waiving of all claims in exchange for $120 -- is currently on the appeal. In any event, beyond the settlement, attached hereto is evidence, including internal CitiFinancial documents provided to ICP by whistleblowers, showing continued predatory lending, insurance sales and other practices at Citigroup. Your agency has a duty to closely consider this evidence, including at the hearing ICP is timely requesting, before even considering allowing 25 million more consumers to be subjected to Citigroup's practices.\nBecause the 2002 HMDA data has just been released - it became available through the FFIEC only on August 1 -- ICP begins this comment with a review of Citigroup ongoing disparities in lending, which also militate for the requested hearing (and for the denial of Citigroup's applications). The 2002 HMDA analysis will be followed by timely presentation that Citigroup remains a predatory lender, that it is increasingly exporting the worst of its predatory practices, and its lax compliance practices, as evidenced by its only-recently-half-settled involvements with Enron and Dynegy, its still not sufficiently reformed self-serving investment advice, its lax anti-money laundering controls (most recently in Nigeria), its lack of human rights standards (the example given involve Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), etc., all militate for the requested hearing and for the denial of Citigroup's applications.\nThe analysis below cumulates CitiMortgage and Citigroup's lead bank in the analyzed market, and calls the two together \"Citibank;\" Citibank's exclusion of African Americans and Latinos from normal-rate loans stands in contrast to the high-rate and predatory practices of CitiFinancial, described below, which are disproportionately targeted to African Americans and Latinos.\nIn 2002 in the New York City Metropolitan Statistical Area (\"MSA\"), for conventional home purchase loans, Citibank (Citibank, N.A. and CitiMortgage together) denied loan applications from African Americans 4.67 times more frequently than applications from whites. Citibank denied Latinos 3.17 times more frequently than whites. This is much worse than other lenders in this MSA: the denial rate disparities for the industry as a whole in 2002 were 1.89 for African Americans, and 1.68 for Latinos.\nCitibank's higher-than-aggregate denial rate disparities are not explained by any greater-than-normal outreach with normal-priced credit to African Americans or Latinos. In 2002 in this MSA, Citibank made 3607 conventional home purchase loans to whites, only 390 to African Americans, and 458 to Latinos.

Here is a table:\n2002 Loans to Businesses with Revenues under $1 Million (Amt in $1000s)\nCitibank Citibank % of Citi Aggreg Aggreg % Agg\nLoans Amount # of Loans Loans Amount # loans\nBronx 41 $1441 3."}

As a direct Community Reinvestment Act matter, The Bronx is also the lowest income county in New York.\nIn a recent search of the OCC's Web site, ICP could find no CRA performance evaluation for Citibank USA, N.A., and only a five year old performance evaluation for Sears National Bank. That exam is out-dated; also, note that the text of that exam, referencing but not following up on a Sears MasterCard program in part of 1997, makes clear that the MasterCard program that Sears began in 2000 changes the performance context -- a new exam is needed, while this proceeding is pending.\nCitigroup Remains a Predatory Lender\nParticularly in light of the OCC's (and the Comptroller's) July 31, 2003, statements that the OCC is committed to acting against predatory lending, ICP hereby timely for the record contends that Citigroup is a predatory lender, and remains one after its $240 million settlement with the FTC (without any binding injunctive relief) and unilateral non-binding reforms (which are entirely limited to real estate loans, and are limited to the United States, see infra). ICP has been receiving troubling documentation of CitiFinancial's practices, from inside the company. Some is attached hereto as exhibits. We received the following letter, from an employee:\nAs a long-time employee of CitiFinancial, formerly Commercial Credit, I can personally testify that while CitiFinancial appears to be [getting] in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission, it couldn't be further from the truth. CitiFinancial's claims that the bad rap came from Associates [First Capital Corp.] is a bunch of BS. CitiFinancial continues to target subprime borrowers charging ridiculous rates, as high was 34% (even on \"Excellent\" risks). They are still flipping or RBO-ing loans... Home Office mails out 'pre-approved' loan vouchers that aren't really pre-approved and bank drafts at lower APRs than what we offer in a branch and then proceed to solicit these unknowing souls and all they did was deposit a check in their bank account! Now to the biggie, retail sales accounts. Once that account is in a branch, the customer better move, change their phone number to non-published and possibly change their name because we are going to call them, mail them, call them again etc. etc. etc.. Flipping a sales account to a personal or equity counts big on ROCOpoly (if you get all of the Quik Plan points, a gain, minimum $ per K and so on)...\nIn the above, \"RBO\" means \"refinance balance only,\" that is, flipping. The above-quoted whistleblower provided ICP with a copy of a CitiFinancial memo to branch managers, from 2003 (that is, after the FTC settlement announced), stating that\nYou may or may not have noticed that your personal loan credit authority has been reduced to $5,000... Any personal loan where the credit approval exceeds your authority you are to refer to me for approval. The purpose is to stimulate Equity Plus business. Do not send an application where the customer is a homeowner to home office credit for approval. I want to review those applications myself. Make sure your staff understands. If the customer qualifies for an equity plus loan I should see notes reflecting their conversation on the sale of that product. If I do not see, the loan will not be approved until the employee has made a sales presentation to the customer for a larger loan paying off debt and building the loan to an equity plus basis... I expect and will inspect for compliance...\nThis means that CitiFinancial blatantly seeks to get a lien against an applicant's home, even if the applicant states that he or she only wants a smaller, unsecured loan. Also attached are exhibits are a number of CitiFinancial training documents, showing inter alia the ROCOpoly bonuses paid for (forced-placed) insurance sales, scripts to use to convince or deceive customers into accepting high-cost credit insurance (including a script of what to say when"}
{"text":" the customer says \"no\"); and a list of \"Ideas for Improving Sales\" making clear that the purpose of soliciting \"collateral lists\" for non-real estate loans is to sell insurance: an ongoing predatory practice at CitiFinancial.\nAs noted, Citigroup's predatory lending is not limited to real estate loans (although its $240 million FTC settlement, and its unilateral, unenforceable \"reform\" announcements are). Here is a sample complain, made to the North Carolina Attorney General's office after the FTC-Citigroup announcement (and obtained by ICP under the freedom of information laws):\nI entered into a contract with Furniture Warehouse... CitiFinancial is the financier for Furniture Warehouse. Under the section entitled \"Special Financing,\" it states that if the contract is paid within 360 days of the contract, there will be no finance charge. It was represented to me by Furniture Warehouse that the agreement involved no interest for one year. [Within a year of the purchase, I made the lump sum payment.] I was then told that the payoff exceeded $500.00. This is when the dispute began... I contacted Ed Mayhew, Manager, CitiFinancial, by mail... At some point, Mayhew called my home, and informed my husband that he was going to sue me. He filed a small claims suit... I appeared at small claims court at the appropriate time, fully prepared to defend my case. Neither Mayhew nor any representative of his office or company had the courtesy to appear... Last year, my credit score was a respectable 719. Now, I am attempting to get a loan, and my financier tells me my score has dropped to 586... As a result the loan has been denied.\nHere are some sample complaints consumers have made to the Missouri Attorney General's Office:\nConsumer says that after six years of payments, she owes more money than the original purchase price and that she has no equity in the home. Company [CitiFinancial] has threatened foreclosure.\"\n\"Consumer purchased a TV from Tex and financed through Company [CitiFinancial]. Total bill came to $1252.00 and she stated that she made six or seven payments and she should only owe $700, Company is stating that she owes $1,000.\"\n\"Company [CitiFinancial] has reported consumer late even though consumer has provided copies of cancelled checks as proof of payment.\"\n\"Company [CitiFinancial] is calling the consumer and harassing them about their account, sometimes five times a month. Checks enclosed show that consumer has paid on time.\" \"Consumer has two loans totaling $54,000 on a home she says is worth $40,500. Consumer wants to make sure this doesn't happen to others.\"\nSome other complaints ICP has received, in the last month (including last week) --\nSubj: CitiMortgage Date: 7\/29\/03 From: [name withheld] To: CitiWatch [at] innercitypress.org\n...We have literally tried for 7 months to over come a plethora of problems in dealing with Citicorp (Mortgage Division). It started first dealing with a subsidiary of Primary Residential Mortgage Company. We were offered a FHA stream-line Mortgage refinance in October of 2002... We closed (the 1st time) in late December. Took to the closing company the payments needed to satisfy the arrangements. Thought at this time all was completed. Several things happened at this moment, number one\u2026 they didn't pay off the existing Mortgage company and I started getting Late notices, and letters stating pending actions if we didn't start paying on the mortgage again. This took a while to resolve, but in the end Primary did take care of that issue and paid the late fees to avoid hurting our credit. Then we were notified by Primary that the first closing was void due to acute errors in the paperwork and we could ether stop the process or we would have to again go through the refinance process again... When we showed up to sign my wife noticed the payments went up approximately 100.00. We also noticed a few other issues, and called our Primary representative. We were told that the first company had errored on our tax and insurance escrow and that is why we had to re do it (first we had heard about this). We were not going to sign, but were informed that again we would have to start this process all over if we didn't. We were told any errors could be handled, to go ahead and sign\u2026 they will take care of it later.\nIn the mean time our loan was sold to CitiMortgage. On our first notice from Citi we noticed the rate was wrong, we called Primary and they took care of that. Then we got another statement from Citi and it had the right amount on it. We had thought we could forget about the mortgage issues we had just overcame. Little did we know, it was really just starting to go"}
{"text":" bad.\nSeveral weeks went by and we received a notice from Citi that we were delinquent on our payment. After checking we found out that Citi had indeed opened 2 mortgage accounts in our name and on the same house. We tried to explain to Citi what had happened, but they couldn't understand or see what had happened. Our Primary representative was off on maternity leave and the people in that office also were clueless. We started getting threatening letters from Citi about our delinquent payments on our house. Now mind you we were making the payment on the \"corrected\" loan. It took about 6 months to get this at least somewhat taken care of. Citi even went as far as turning us over to a type of collection agency. Citi also notified us that they would retract any ill credit reports in fact said they didn't even report on that loan.\nUnfortunately I was denied credit recently due to the fact that Citi did report not only the delinquent payments, but also showed 2 home loans for over 100,000 a piece which placed our debt to earnings ratio way out of sorts. We were going to try and refinance at even a lower rate but were unable to due to the existing loan(s) being in such disarray.\nThey didn't pay our taxes with Spokane County and we were sent notice of default. Our insurance wasn't paid on time and we had to change Insurance companies due to the rate bracket they put us in due to our Citicorp-created credit woes.\nSo where do we stand presently, well my wife and I have logged dozens upon dozens of hours trying to get this straightened out (and it still isn't). We have missed work trying to resolve this. Our credit is still in turmoil at this point. They still have not refunded the escrow money (they say it doesn't exist now). We were promised the escrow overage would be refunded, now they are billing us saying we are short escrow money. They won't return our calls. When we do get a hold of them, no one knows anything, they won't let us talk to a supervisor when we ask... This has gone on way too long, it's been 7 months of pure hell. They don't listen, they don't care.\nDate: 7\/22\/03 2:59:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time From: [ ] To: CitiWatch [at] FairFinanceWatch.org\nMy husband and I had a mortgage for many years with First Nationwide Mortgage which was merged into (bought by) CitiMortgage, Inc. The transition took place last March 2003. What has transpired since that time has become a worse nightmare as each day goes by. To make it short, they have and are violating RESPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Credit Collections Act and numerous other federal statutes. Even though our case is being 'handled' by the President of CitiMortgage's office (\"presidential investigation\", they like to call it), we have received no return phone calls, no written responses to letters, including our \"qualified written request\" since May 15, 2003. (Today is July 22, 2003.) Our once perfect payment record is now a shambles despite continuing to make on time payments. They have made our payment and credit records a mess and refuse to communicate or to remedy their illegal actions. We cannot even refinance with another lender due to this. We are not interested in class action suits that result in paltry slaps on the wrist of Citigroup and nothing to remedy the damage that is being done to consumers (e.g., Morales, et al). My venture into looking for attorneys is done with trepidation. My first question to a law firm is if they have ever or are presently representing Citigroup, CitiFinancial, CitiMortgage, and\/or any of their myriad entities. You wouldn't believe how many firms do not return my calls. Is everyone afraid of these guys? I've been reading with great interest your web site.\nDate: 7\/11\/03 7:33:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time From: [Name withheld pursuant to request - see below]To: CitiWatch [at] innercitypress.org\nI found your site as I was searching for any suits brought against CitiMortgage for fraudulent PMI premiums. In late February of this year, my husband and I purchased a home. We chose Citigroup Mortgage Company to handle our financing because at the time I truly believed they were an honest company that was looking out for families like ours who wanted a home of their own and out of debt. I was even considering becoming an agent for them through Primerica and help other families become debt free. I even went as far as getting my insurance license. When we received the \"Pre-Approved\" paperwork that we signed and sent back to them, it estimated our mortgage payment at about $850.00 a month. This included the PMI"}
{"text":", which was estimated at $77.00. I understand the need for the PMI as my husband and I were purchasing the property with no money down. The property we purchased consist of 4 lots in all and is zoned for Commercial. There is 40x45 commercial building that we purchased with the house. The appraiser, which Citigroup provided, estimated this property at exactly the amount we were purchasing the property for. I was not concerned about this at the time; I was actually happy. Now that I see things looking back, I can see why they would not want it to appraise for more. It puzzles me that a property of this size with both buildings appraised at $16,000 less than the original asking price. It took 3 WEEKS for the appraiser to bring back comps to the company that the underwriter would accept. I was told by the loan processor that the original comps were coming in too low!!! I can not understand this. All in all, I was repeatedly reassured by the representatives of the mortgage company that everything would be fine. Once we arrived at the closing, which was pushed back by 3 weeks due to various delays, we found out that our monthly payment jumped $200.00 from the originally estimated amount!!!! We were NEVER advised through the two months that we worked with this company of this change. If we had, we would have clearly opted to not purchasing the house! In fact, with the closing date being 3 weeks overdue, we had already signed the offer, and not knowing this information until the time of closing, my husband and I found ourselves backed into a corner. We were made to believe by the realtor that if we did back out at the closing table that there may be some legal ramifications from the seller! Needless to say, my husband and I did sign and now find ourselves with a mortgage payment that we clearly can not afford. It turns out the reason for the tremendous increase in payment was due to the amount of the PMI insurance jumping from the $77.00 originally estimated to $271.00!!!! The mortgage company states that the original estimate on the \"pre-approval\" paperwork did not take into consideration our credit criteria. Now, I ask, how can you \"pre-approve\" someone for a $78,000 loan without first considering their credit history? I have since researched and now realize that this insurance is based on the loan to value ratio, the type of loan, and the type of coverage required by the lender. It has nothing to do with our income or credit rating. In addition, PMI premiums should typically cost between 1\/2% to 1% of the loan. In our case that would be $780.00 a year at the most. We are paying $3,252.00 a year by my calculations! Over the length of a 30 yr loan, they could potentially earn $97,560.00! That is more than our original loan, not to mention the 8.125% interest rate! Citigroup excused themselves of doing any wrong by stating that they have no control over the cost of the PMI because it is set by the insurance company. That is very interesting, seeing how Citigroup is the parent company of Travelers Insurance! It would not surprise me if Traveler's is, in fact, the insurance agency handling the PMI! In addition, I believe the appraisal was intentionally brought in at the purchase amount in order to force the need for PMI? I find it hard to believe that our property is not valued at at least 20% more than what we purchased it for. In the past few months since our purchase, I have seen quite a few properties that were of small size and on smaller lots sell for more than we purchased our home for. The sellers were happy to sell it for what they could get because it was part of an estate and they were about to lose the property for back taxes due. I have contact my State Legislator and his office has been very expeditious in investigating the matter. Unfortunately, this may not help us and the financial strain it has caused, but I hope that it prevents other families from being taken advantage of by Citigroup. They are truly a wolf in sheep's clothing! I encourage your readers to contact their state officials and take any opportunity they can to publicize the underhanded practices of this company. I request that you keep this anonymous, as the possibility of taking legal action against Citigroup is still being investigated.\nDate: 6\/16\/03 4:38:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time From: [Name withheld]To: CitiWatch [at] innercitypress.org...\nOur mortgage was with Associates and was sold to CitiFinancial. Since then I have become terminally ill and of course my income dropped dramatically, we contacted CitiFinancial to make them aware of the problem I asked to have the house refinanced to get a lower rate and they refused when the mortgage got behind they promised a deferral on the payments and after"}
{"text":" much paperwork they told us everything was approved and we were ok, then they wrote us approximately 4 to 6 months later saying we were behind again and that the deferral didn't go through, so we tried a deferral again with the same results a few months later, this same cycle has taken place 4 times since 1999 culminating in a phone call today 6\/16\/2003 notifying us that we are 128 days behind ( by our records we are only approximately 70 days behind ), and because of this they are starting foreclosure proceedings, we tried to refinance the house with another lender in 2000 but CitiFinancial refused to give the other lender a pay-off amount so they said they couldn't help us, we have made repeated attempts to rectify the situation* * *[Another message from last week]...I am in Ohio and am having a problem with Citi bank to the fact that I think a class action suit may be necessary. I liked your web site information and the information provided was invaluable to me. Let me explain. We have a Key bank card that is held by Citibank. We have always paid on time, paid more and have a great rating among any one we have ever worked with. Our car lease is paid 3-4 months in advance, our house payments are paid two months in advance. We don't have multiple credit cards and only have this card and one other. That's it. We received a note in the mail stating that Citi Bank was raising their rate to 18% citing excessive debt. BUT!! Our other credit card company has kept us at 7 \ufffd% and we have a 0 balance on the other card as well as the Citi bank card as of last week. We don't have any other debt. We are in the process of obtaining the credit reports. I have a sincere feeling that this is a ploy by Citibank to raise the rates. Even the person at Citibank in the executive offices said that I was an excellent customer and he did not understand it either. He offered to keep me at the 7 \ufffd% but what about the other people consumers that are faced with this same situation??? I called the bank here in Ohio and they gave me a rude snot at Citibank that was verbally threatening that he would go ahead and take my account and close it. Well I will close it on my own... Your information gave me the inside track that] Citibank that has become this \"monster in the industry\" just thinks they can walk over anyone at any time with no regard for anyone...\nCitigroup's application mentions Primerica, ironically under the rubric of the Community Reinvestment Act. ICP has obtained -- and your agency should request, review and act on -- numerous complaints that have been filed with the Federal Trade Commission against Primerica. Here also, for the record, is a complaint directed to ICP earlier this month:\nDate: 7\/28\/03 9:15:40 AM From [name withheld] To: CitiWatch [at] innecitypress.org\nI had a run in with Primerica Financial Services. The insurance agent called himself a financial analyst and showed us mutual funds and some stock. We thought we were talking to a financial planner and this man turned out to be nothing but an insurance agent. One reason why we trusted him so much was that he was referred to us by a Pastor of a church that we used to attend.\nWe realize that we needed to read the contact, and we did go over it, but we felt that he was being honest with us so that we would be able to use him as our financial advisor. Come to find out he mislead on 3 items:\nHe did not reveal to us that he was getting commission, we asked him how do you make money? He said when you do. Not true, he did get a commission. Mislead on the cost of the account; mislead as to how much we could remove from the account when it was time to diversify the funds. As of now we are still in a 3% fixed account. Thank God we did not annuitize with this man. When we first met him, he did not say the word annuity. So we thought we were working with a financial planner someone who would help us. He did not call us like he said he would to help us. This account is very unsuitable for us because we are retired now and under the 72T rule and we need income now. I just do not understand how this man could be so dishonest with us, because he was referred to my by my old Pastor.\nWe realize that we rolled our 401K over to Primerica and Travelers but is there any way that we can get out without paying a penalty?... He did introduce himself as a financial analyst....\nParticularly because Citigroup has explicitly referenced -- and sought CRA credit for - Primerica in its application, your agency has a duty to inquire into and act on these and"}
{"text":" other Primerica matters.\nCitigroup is also deeply involved in questionable subprime lending through its investment banking operation. For example, Salomon Brothers Realty Corp. has provided warehouse lines of credit of $775 million to subprime lender New Century Mortgage Corporation (\"New Century\"), requiring New Century either to securitize $1 billion of loans through Salomon Smith Barney as sole underwriter, or, in the alternative, to sell $1 billion in loans to Salomon Brothers Mortgage Securities VII for their own securitization. As simply another example, Salomon Smith Barney has been the underwriter for the subprime mortgage backed securities issuances of Centex Home Equity. What standards do SSB and Citigroup have for working with subprime lenders? Apparently none. Citigroup and SSB pulled out the stops in lobbying against a New York City ordinance that would have required them to certify they were not involved in predatory lending (see, e.g., Crain's New York Business of March 2, 2003); Citigroup has previously sought \"confidential treatment\" for even the names of the subprime lenders with which it does business. The OCC should obtain and release this list, and hold the requested hearings.\nCitigroup Is Exporting the Worst of its Predatory Practices\nAccording to Citigroup's SEC filings, in 2002 Citigroup's consumer finance operations in North America had a net interest margin, of 8.47 per cent, while globally, outside of North America, its net interest margin on consumer finance was an astounding 21.14 per cent. ICP contends that Citigroup is a predatory lender globally -- worse, in many ways, outside of the U.S. that within. For the record:\nCitigroup and its predecessors were engaged in controversial subprime lending well before the acquisition of Associates in 2000. The upper echelon of management at Citigroup -- Sandy Weill, new CEO Charles Prince, new COO Bob Willumstad, et al. -- were all active with the Baltimore-based subprime lender Commercial Credit, which was challenged for predatory lending in 1997 when it applied to acquire additional subprime business from Bank of America, and for a federal savings bank charter. See, e.g., \"Travelers Unit's Loan Record Hit,\" National Underwriter, June 23, 1997; \"Calling Travelers 'Predatory,' Group Hits Deal with B of A,\" American Banker, June 13, 1997, Pg. 3.\nAfter the 1998 merger with Citicorp, Commercial Credit was renamed CitiFinancial; by early 2001, it was reported that \"Citigroup, the world's largest financial services provider, began its Indian operations with the launch of CitiFinancial Retail Services India Limited. To begin with CitiFinancial will offer easy financing schemes, at retail outlets for the purchase of consumer durable, PC and two wheelers\" (See, India Business Insight. \"Citigroup Unveils Easy Buy Scheme,\" January 29, 2001).\nSoon after buying Banamex, Citigroup formed what it called a \"Consumer Products Unit For Emerging Markets,\" saying that \"the new unit would accelerate the expansion of non-banking consumer financial services into the emerging markets\" (Citigroup press release on Business Wire, May 29, 2002). This press release indicated how and where CitiFinancial was going, by contrasting that \"Citibank has consumer-banking operations in 36 of its 80 emerging market countries\" with the fact that \"[i]n the Emerging Markets Citigroup today has consumer finance businesses in 8 countries with assets of $2.5 billion.\"\nA major market targeted by CitiFinancial is Brazil. Charging interest rates up to 40%, CitiFinancial in early 2003 opened nine offices in Brazil, projecting that it would open 100 more branches over the next five years (Latin Trade, \"Branching Out,\" July 2003). Regarding this expansion, CitiFinancial Mortgage senior vice president L. Ramesh has been quoted that \"[i]n several markets, we are the first ones to give them consumer credit... [We ask:]'Where do you live? What kind of stuff do you have?'\" (Bank Systems & Technology. \"CitiFinancial Adopts Lending Model to Emerging Markets,\" April 21, 2003).\nInquiring into \"what kind of stuff do you have\" is reminiscent of CitiFinancial's inquiries with its U.S. personal loan customers, in order to sell them credit insurance they may not need. ICP \/ FFW asked then-Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill about it at the company's April 2002 annual meeting; the Wall Street Journal finally got Citigroup's answer (hereby entered into the record):\nWhen it makes a personal loan, CitiFinancial often asks the holders of personal loans to provide collateral. In some cases, according to CitiFinancial documents filed by Inner City Press, that collateral includes fishing lures and tackle boxes, record albums, tents, sleeping bags and lanterns -- items"}
{"text":" that CitiFinancial would almost certainly never bother to collect in the event of a borrower's default. Yet insurance is sold on the collateral in case it is damaged or lost.\n\"It's predatory: This insurance product has no rationale, because it's not credible that someone would want to have their loan paid with their leaf-blower,\" said Matthew Lee, executive director of the Fair Finance Watch project at Inner City Press. \"Citigroup has not lived up to the subprime lending reforms it announced after acquiring Associates.\"\nCitigroup officials concede seizing such collateral would be more hassle than it's worth. But they say providing such collateral on loans has a purpose -- \"to make the borrower more responsible for paying the loan back,\" says Ajay Banga, Citigroup's business head of consumer lending. (\"Efforts by Citigroup to Reform Subprime Unit Raise Questions,\" Wall Street Journal, July 19, 2002).\nHere, Citigroup acknowledged that while it asked its customers \"what kind of stuff do you have?\" in order to list the items as collateral and sell insurance on them, it has no intention of foreclosing on the collateral. In fact, ICP has been informed by current and former CitiFinancial employees that the property lists are compiled in order to sell insurance (American Banker, October 11, 2002, Pg. 1).\nCitiFinancial has opened in South Korea, charging interest rates of thirty percent. \"Although these rates are higher than the annual 24 percent charged by credit card companies for similar cash advances, CitiFinancial has an edge in that their loans are cheaper than those extended by existing loan sharks... Another reason that people are drawn to the company is because of the renowned brand of its parent group, Citigroup. Customers thus tend to think the company will refrain from excessively aggressive collecting methods\" (Korea Herald, July 30, 2002).\nThe trust that Citigroup would eschew excessively aggressive collection practices, particularly overseas, would be misplaced. last would be wrong. The Asian Wall Street Journal of May 25, 1999 for example, \"Paid Back: Citibank in India Has Hired Collectors Said to Use Threats,\" has reported on a Citibank loan in India being collected on with no less than a knife to the throat.\nICP \/ FFW have been pointing out that not even CitiFinancial's few reforms in the U.S. apply to any of CitiFinancial's non-U.S. lending. Citigroup to date has dodged this question -- when most recently asked, by the Los Angeles Times (July 30, 2003), \" Citigroup spokesman Steve Silverman said the company was proud of having'very good' lending practices throughout the world and of how it has improved standards at the largest U.S. subprime lender, Associates First Capital Corp., which it acquired and wrapped into CitiFinancial in 2000.\" Above, ICP has timely contested not only that Citigroup has sufficiently reformed in the U.S., but that its practices \"throughout the world\" are anywhere near \"very good\" -- in fact, they are predatory.\nCitigroup Is Insufficiently Compliant to Allow 25 Million More Consumers to be Subjected to It\nThe Citigroup is compliance-challenged is well known, including to the OCC, which as recently as July 28, 2003, entered an enforcement order, which Citigroup's CEO-apparent Chuck Prince gloated about in a July 28 press release (although, strangely, the OCC did not get his signature on the enforcement order, though it did get COO Bob Willumstad). Litigation around Citigroup's role(s) with Enron, Dynegy, et al. will continue -- COO Willumstad told Reuters (July 29) that \"[w]e have set aside a significant amount of reserves for Enron and research matters, obviously, this is something that will play out over a long period of time, and we'll see how it goes.\" Citigroup's actions with respect to WorldCom are even more unresolved, at present.\nIt is also far from clear that Citigroup has sufficient safeguards in place (as must be reviewed in connection with this Bank Merger Act application, under the USA Patriot Act). Beyond Salinas, Abacha and all the rest, Citigroup continues being identified by government agencies as being lax on money laundering. [See, \"Citibank CEO Docked for Money Laundering,\" Vanguard (Lagos) June 19, 2003.]\nCitigroup's standardless activities in Africa are worse than \"mere\" money laundering. In mid-1994, near the end of the 100 day period in which over 750,000 Rwandans were killed, the extremist Hutu regime went into \"exile\" in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo f\/k\/a Zaire, where they purported to set up a branch of the National Bank of Rwanda, \"which continued to place orders for arms and other supplies, and guarantee"}

Pierre Galand of Belgium's council of development NGOs (CNCD) cites Citibank, Dresdner Bank (Germany) and Banque Nationale de Paris\" (Le Soir, January 27, 1997).\nCitibank, now the largest bank in the world, shows up again in the Great Lakes Region, in the 2001 United Nations report on the traffic in conflict diamonds in the Democratic Republic of Congo:\nThe 56 page report details how transport networks and financial institutions accommodate the exchange of mineral resources for arms, and cash for arms.\n\"At the heart of the financial setting is the Banque de commerce, du developpement et d'industrie (BCDI) located in Kigali Rwanda,\" explains the report. \"According to some sources, there was an understanding between the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and the late Laurent Kabila on the collection and use of financial resources during the time of the AFDL rebellion.\"\nThe report uses an example to illustrate the links between BCDI, Citibank in New York, the diamond business and armed rebellion.\n\"In a letter signed by J.P. Moritz, general manager of Societe miniere de Bakwanga (MIBA), a diamond company, and Ngandu Kamenda, the general manager of MIBA ordered a payment of US $ 3.5 million to la Generale de commerce dimport\/export du Congo (COMIEX), a company owned by late President Kabila and some of his close allies, such as Minister Victor Mpoyo, from an account in BCDI through a Citibank account. \"This amount of money was paid as a contribution from MIBA to the AFDL war effort.\" Asked about the relationship between BCDI and Citibank in New York, Ba-N'Daw said that Citibank had been the correspondent bank of BCDI\n-- \"Report Names Culprits in Central Africa's Dirty War,\" Environment News Service, 4\/19\/01\nHow, despite this demonstrated lack of anti-money laundering and human rights standards, Citigroup now claims to be a leader in adopting environmental standards, is not known to ICP; the public record, despite Citigroup's Equator Principles and other recent announcement, militates in favor of the requested hearings and for the denial of Citigroup's applications.\nThis Proposed Combination Would be Anticompetitive and Harm Consumers\nIt is especially troubling, in light of Citigroup's lax compliance culture demonstrated above, that there are consumer protection issues already with Sears' credit card operations. Sears is one of the few large lenders to have entered a guilty plea, for criminal bankruptcy fraud in connection with unrecorded reaffirmation agreements, leading to a $60 million fine and headlines like \"The Sorry Side of Sears\" (Newsweek) and \"Judge: Sears 'preyed' on debtor; Retailer violated bankruptcy laws\" (Boston Globe). See also, Denver Post of February 27, 2001, \" New windows put woman's home at risk;\" and \"Tucson, Ariz., Man Says Sears Owes Refunds to Credit Card Customers,\" Arizona Daily Star of October 29, 2002. There are also serious consumer privacy questions raised, to be further elaborated at the requested hearing. See, e.g., \"A Gold Mine of Data about a Consumer's Tastes, Pocketbook,\" Washington Times of June 17, 2001:\nSears obtains countless bits of information from consumers who use its credit cards. \"Sears credit cards give us access to point-of-sale information that we wouldn't get when people use cash or other credit cards,\" said Jan Drummond, a Sears spokeswoman. The department store has about 60 million credit card holders - 32 million to 33 million are active purchasers who buy something at least once a year. And Sears gains about 4 million new accounts a year.\nThe information collected includes everything from the customer's name, address and what they are buying to when they are buying it. Paying with cash doesn't reveal that information.\nThe credit card industry, particular the store card industry, is notoriously \"sticky\" \/ non-sensitive when it comes to interest rates. See, e.g., the Columbus Dispatch of December 16, 2001, \"Interest-Rate Cuts Elude Many Borrowers,\" listing Sears with the highest rates of the companies surveyed:\n\"Interest rates are even higher for store-issued credit cards, which average 20.4 percent, only slightly lower than the average a year ago, according to Cardweb.com. Lazarus charges 21.6 percent interest on its credit card, as do Marshall Field's, Jacobson's, Lord & Taylor, Kaufmann's and Saks Fifth Avenue. Not much different are Sears (21.9 percent), JCPen"}
{"text":"ney (21 percent), Eddie Bauer (18.9 percent) and Talbot's (21.6 percent).\"\nFor the record, the foreseeable competitive effects of this proposal strongly militate for the hearing(s) ICP is requesting. Beyond the foreseeable anti-competitive impacts (\"The deal will increase Citigroup's card portfolio to about $ 170 billion and solidify its market-leader position -- far ahead of No. 2 card issuer MBNA, which had a $ 107 billion portfolio at the end of last year,\" USA Today, July 16, 2003; \" Recent figures from the Nilson Report indicate that the acquisition of the Sears store card will see Citigroup become the second largest private label card issuer in the US (behind GE Consumer Finance) with total private label receivables rising from $7.3 billion to $25.7 billion. Citigroup is already the largest general-purpose card issuer in the US and the world.\" Cards International, July 24, 2003.\nThere are other questions: \"The Sears announcement forced Richard W. Ussery, TSYS chairman and CEO, to address the possible repercussions of the buyout. Columbus, GA-based TSYS processes Sears' private-label and Gold MasterCard portfolios along with Citi's commercial cards. Ussery said it was too early to speculate on any changes but that TSYS has good relations with both firms. TSYS' processing deal with Sears lasts another seven years, he said. \"We anticipate we will continue to service that (contract),\" Ussery said. If Citi were to decide to cut the deal short, there would be a \"substantial penalty to pay\" and \"it would probably be a couple years\" before Citi could move the processing in-house or to another processor, Ussery said.\" CardLine, July 18, 2003\nThere are numerous other questions, including how it in the public interest (and not contrary to the spirit of the Bank Merger Act and other applicable law and regulation) to subject at least 23 million more consumers to Citigroup's demonstrably predatory practices. ICP will make further presentation to this effect at the requested hearing(s). On the grounds set forth above, public hearings should be held, and, Citigroup's applications should be denied.\nHow to Contact Us Site Map Search This Site Inner City Press' Community Reinvestment Reporter Global Inner Cities Citigroup Watch Inner City Reporter Bank Beat Inner City Poetry Community Reinvestment Environmental Justice Insurance Redlining In the Bronx FCC\/Telecommunications About Inner City Press Inner City Arts&Culture Inner City Housing ICP's Freedom of Information Guide Links\/Resources Frequently Asked Questions The Inner City Reporter's Federal Reserve Beat Privacy Policy For the Media Inner City Public Interest Law Center What's New on Site\nCopyright 2002 -2003 Inner City Press\/Community on the Move, Inc..

{"text":"A Conversation with Nobel Prize Winner Rajendra Pachauri\nIn an interview with Yale Environment 360, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the next U.S. administration must play a leading role in global climate change policy and cautions that China and the developing world must not follow the same path of industrialization as the United States and western Europe.\nSeveral weeks ago, Rajendra Pachauri \u2014 the Indian engineer and economist whose Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore \u2014 stopped by the offices of Yale Environment 360 to talk about the path the world must take to slow global warming. He was on yet another stop of what certainly must be one of the most hectic travel schedules on the planet. When we saw him, Pachauri was in the midst of a trip that was taking him from China, to the United States, to Europe, to Africa, and then back to China, all within a few weeks.\nPopping lozenges to soothe a scratchy throat, Pachauri spoke to e360 editor Roger Cohn and senior editor Fen Montaigne for nearly an hour about his vision of how to tackle the growing climate crisis: the need for the developed world to set an example by beginning to wean itself from oil and coal, the moral duty of the world's rich nations to help undeveloped countries adapt to wrenching, climate-related changes, and the close link between global warming and international peace and security:\nHere is an edited version of our conversation:\ne360 editor Roger Cohn: We are here in our offices with Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr. Pachauri, welcome back to New Haven. We are absolutely delighted and honored to have you as our guest. And we'll start with a very recent development. President Bush has proposed that the United States wait until 2025 to start reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. What's your reaction to the president's recent statement on this?\nRajendra Pachauri: I think it's a positive step. It's a step in the right direction. One can question and maybe quarrel with the contents of what has been said. But if you compare this to what was being said from the White House six years ago, it's a big step forward. I think it certainly makes it possible for whoever is going to occupy the White House next year to build on this commitment.\ne360: But is it nearly enough? It may be a step forward from what has been the policy, but do you think it's anywhere near what the U.S. needs to be doing between now and 2025?\nPachauri: Well, I suppose there's a negotiating process which is on, so one wouldn't expect any country to make a unilateral commitment that's any more ambitious than what's been stated so far. There are two reasons why I feel generally pleased with this. The first is the fact that this marks a major shift from what was being said earlier by this administration. If I could say something which is actually paraphrasing what [German Environment] Minister [Sigmar] Gabriel said: in some sense it's like Neil Armstrong reaching the moon, when he said that, \"This is a small step for me, but a giant step for mankind.\" And he [Gabriel] said that what President Bush has said is a small step for mankind, but a giant step for the president.\nDr. Rajendra Pauchari. MATTHEW GARRETT\ne360: Are you concerned, though, that given the pace of physical change, the world does not have 17 years to wait for the U.S. to kick into gear?\nPachauri: I think that's absolutely right. And you know, in the IPCC, we have clearly assessed stabilization scenarios. And one particular scenario, which would essentially limit temperature increases to two to 2.4 degrees Celsius, would require that we allow peaking to take place no later than 2015. And beyond 2015 global emissions have to start declining.\nSo I agree with you. If the world is serious about containing climate change \u2014 and some may even argue that two degrees or 2.4 degrees of increase is much too high, for good reason \u2014 it should probably say that we need to bring down emissions very rapidly. And 2015 should be the outside limit. So compared to that, yes, 2025 is 10 years much later. And therefore one could hope that when a new administration takes office, and does its homework, then they will be able to come up with something more inspiring for the rest of the world.\ne360: What do you believe the new administration \u2014 whether it's President Obama, or McCain, or Clinton \u2014 what steps do you believe that next U.S. president needs to take immediately and specifically to address these issues?\nPachauri: Firstly I think whoever is in the position of leadership"}
{"text":" in the new administration must realize that it's imperative that the U.S. must lead in this effort. I think it's also important that the U.S. must regain its prestige, must regain its credibility, its influence. Because today, let's face it, the political influence of the U.S. in global forums is very, very low, for a variety of reasons. And in climate change, people just feel as though the U.S. is not in the mainstream at all. So not only must the U.S. be in the mainstream, but it should be the leader as far as action is concerned. I feel very strongly about that. I do realize that obviously the U.S. is not going to take action which is going to be detrimental to the economy and to the well-being of its people. But there is now so much evidence to show that much can be done without loss of jobs. Much can be done without loss of economic output.\nAs a matter of fact, a number of measures that can be taken have so many so-called co-benefits at the local and the national level that in effect you would be taking some of these steps at negative cost. So the economy would probably do much better. There would be benefits of energy security, which would lead to easy access to energy resources at lower prices, lower costs. There would be benefits in terms of global food security. You know what's happening in several countries today \u2014 there are riots, there are demonstrations, there is a palpable sense of fear and panic all around. And climate change is not the only reason that is leading to this decline in food output. But over a period of time it's going to be a growing impact in terms of reduction in yields and productivity. So, I think there are huge benefits, not only to the world but to specific societies that take the right steps. And I think a price on carbon is absolutely essential.\nI was a little concerned to read that there's some talk about taking away taxes on gasoline, which I think would be a backward step. I mean, look at the rest of the world and what they are paying for petroleum products. In the words of the president himself, America is addicted to oil. Let's kick that addiction. Let's kick that habit. There has to be a very specific commitment through the pricing mechanism, through the market, to see that we shift to other than fossil fuels as sources of energy.\ne360: When you look at the effort to slow climate change, what do you believe has been the price of U.S. inaction over the last eight years?\nPachauri: I would say that globally there hasn't been too much action. Because firstly, of course, the U.S. and Australia didn't ratify the Kyoto protocol. And that certainly, in my view, reduced the resolve on the part of even those countries that ratified the Kyoto protocol, because it took away a little bit of the sanctity of this multilateral agreement, even if it's not a perfect agreement. And you can't get perfect agreements when you get all the countries in the world to agree to something. It's always something which is the result of compromise. But the result [of inaction] has been that we find the increase in temperature has been much faster in recent years.\nJust to give you an indicator, of the 12 warmest years since we've had recorded data on temperatures, 11 have taken place in the last 12 years. If you look at sea level rise since 1993, the rate of sea level rise has been much faster than what happened in the previous 40 years.\nSo the cost of inaction has been very harmful to not only the world as a whole, but certainly to some of the most vulnerable regions in the world. And the fact that the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave the Nobel Peace Prize to the IPCC and Mr. Al Gore clearly establishes the link that they see between climate change and peace and stability. Now if you have problems of sea level rise which threaten the well-being of societies in the free parts of the world, if you have the problem of food security, and growing water scarcity, that clearly is going to be destructive of peace in different parts of the world. And I would say that the inaction that we have seen in the last 16 years since the Framework Convention came into existence is only going to make these problems much worse \u2014 perhaps taking them to a crisis level in some cases.\ne360: It's been somewhat unexpected that in recent months all of these problems, this sort of perfect storm of problems \u2014 of drought in Australia, of food shortages, of these intensifying physical changes, particularly at the poles \u2014 have occurred. In your opinion is this happening much more quickly than many thought it would happen?\nPachauri: Absolutely. You know, we have clearly projected that there is an increase in extreme precipitation events, which will continue. There will be more heat waves. That is happening already \u2014 floods, droughts"}
{"text":", and a growing scarcity of water in different parts of the world. So all of this is in some sense reaching a boiling point, and it's really not a matter of coincidence that all of these are happening together. They'll probably get much worse over time if we do nothing.\ne360: Looking at the physical and ecological changes that are taking place around the world right now, what that you're seeing gives you most cause for concern?\nPachauri: There are a variety of things. I'm concerned about the melting of the glaciers which will affect (in terms of availability of water), we have estimated, something like 500 million people in South Asia, some 250 million in China\u2026 And the fact that the flow in these rivers is going to decline is not only going to affect the water that flows in the rivers, but also the recharge of the aquifers. Because rivers perform an extremely vital function in terms of recharging ground water resources.\nSo all of that goes down. And if you don't have enough water in the rivers, what will people do? They're going to pump out more and more water from underground sources. And this has other implications because it's only the rich who can afford the energy, and the installation, and capital equipment to pump out that water. The poor will have no option at all but to just beg, or steal, or whatever. So, again, you're asking for a very unfavorable outcome in terms of the security and stability of a society.\nI'm concerned about several countries in Africa where we have projected that agricultural productivity by 2020 may go down by 50 percent. That could be disastrous because these are countries that don't have the money to import food, particularly at the prices that we see today and that we can project for the future. I'm worried about the growing water scarcity.\nAgain, by 2020 we expect 75 million to 250 million people being further stressed as far as water availability is concerned on account of climate change. These are things you can see. You just have to travel to these countries. Obviously in them are the seeds of potential conflict and a great deal of suffering. And certainly something that the world today, when communications and images from far away enter into our bedrooms, we just cannot accept. It would be inhuman. It would be totally insensitive to just shut our eyes to what's happening in the rest of the world, particularly when these communities have had no share of the responsibility for causing the problem to start with. So there's an ethical and equity dimension in the whole thing, which I think as human beings we just can't ignore.\ne360: You mentioned that ethical dimension in your Nobel acceptance speech. And you talked about the Hindu philosophy of the world as a single community of one.\nPachauri: Right. Yes. It's one family.\ne360: In your thinking, how does that apply to a global response to this issue?\nPachauri: We really ought to look at the most dispossessed communities. We ought to look at the most underprivileged, the most vulnerable communities, in the world. But do we ever bother about them? No, we don't. We don't look at the small island states. We don't look at the most impoverished regions of Africa who are living under conditions of stress on account of a number of factors. But climate change is going to make these much worse. So I think what ethical behavior would require is that we look at the worst affected regions of the world and then determine our global responses and actions to ensure that somehow we contain the level of problems that they will face. So I think equity and ethics go together in this issue.\ne360: And concretely, what do you think countries such as the United States, member states of the European Union, Japan, the huge emitters, should do? What concrete steps in terms of help, adaptation, mitigation, should be taken to help these very impoverished areas?\nPachauri: Well, the first thing we need to do is to generally help them establish the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change. To be quite honest, most of these countries have zero capacity. I mean, they have been coping with changes in weather, changes in climate, which take place naturally. But what we are talking about today is far beyond the range of what is in their capacity to handle. So I think we need to help them create that capacity. In some cases, we may have to provide infrastructure. If in areas you're going to have much greater scarcity of water, how are we going to ensure water is stored when it's available so that people can get at least some quantity throughout the year? This may require storage facilities and other infrastructure, and knowledge, technology. The ability to cope with some of these problems; I think that's extremely important.\nSecondly, I think if we want countries to be able to move along a path that is sustainable and not necessarily a replication of what the developed world has done, I think you"}
{"text":" have to help them set up public transport infrastructure.\n[These are] substantial examples of where the developed world, by helping some of these societies, would be helping the world and therefore helping themselves as well. I think there's a range of things that can be done \u2014 facilitate investments in some of these sustainable technologies, possibly provide funding to make technologies available that are sustainable. There are 1.6 billion people in this world who don't have access to modern forms of energy or electricity. There are 400 million people in India who don't have access to electricity. And a number of them have darkness once the sun goes down. They might have a little bit of kerosene oil or something, and light a little wick stove which gives you a flicker of light during the evening. What we've developed is a solar lantern that costs roughly the equivalent of $70. This can be provided to people. They will pay for it if they are given credit, if they are given financing options. And they can light up their homes using a sustainable, clean source of energy.\nSo I have launched a program called \"Lighting a Billion Lives.\" If one was to do this on a global basis \u2014 and I'm not saying that this is going to be easy \u2014 it would cost the equivalent of 15 or 16 billion dollars. How much is the war in Iraq costing \u2014 twelve billion dollars a month? So you know, there's something very distorted in this world, and if we keep ignoring these kinds of reality, we're only going to compound the problem over a period of time\u2026 Surely as a global community we can find the resources to make something like this [solar lanterns] happen. This is a very, very small price to pay.\ne360: In the IPCC Report you forecast that at the high end there would be possible sea level rise by the end of the 21st century of two feet. And now more recent reports talk about sea level rise of five feet or more in that time frame. Now, knowing this, do you think that your forecast may prove to have been conservative?\nPachauri: Actually in the Synthesis Report, which we produced in November, we clearly stated that we don't know enough, and therefore we weren't placing an upper limit on the amount of sea level rise that we will get. Because, frankly, the jury is still out, and we don't have enough evidence to provide an upper bound on how much sea level rise would take place. And God forbid, if the Western Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets were to collapse, then we're talking about a sea level rise of several meters. And that clearly means that we're changing the geography of this planet. Because there are several low-lying areas, including some in North America, that will just vanish.\ne360: I wanted to ask a quick question about the economic rise of China and India, the growing affluence there. How do you think China, India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia can develop and have greater affluence, without creating the kind of climate disaster that would happen if they start creating the sort of greenhouse gases that we Americans do? What paths of development do you foresee that can be a way out of this?\nPachauri: Firstly let me talk about the sociopolitical situation, as it exists. I think if we want to provide a compelling case for these countries to move along a different path, then I think the developed countries have to take some urgent and vigorous action to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. And this would require a major shift in terms of the way we do business: the size of cars, the inefficiency of the automobile sector, the excessive reliance on private vehicles rather than public transport, requiring much greater investments in public transport in the developed countries.\nAll of this will provide compelling evidence to the developing world that this is a serious problem, where the developed world is not going to impose two standards: That we are going to have all the good things in life, and you guys better make all the sacrifices when you grow and develop. I think there's a sociopolitical dimension to this problem, which really means that countries in the developed world have to take leadership. The second thing would be to facilitate some of the things that I just talked about \u2014 whether it's the use of solar photovoltaic technology, whether it is investments in public transport.\nSo I think we need to provide resources to see that the developing countries don't get hooked onto the same path of development that we have over here. But that's easier said than done because in this day and age everybody watches television. They look at the soap operas, they look at all the good things in life that people have in the developed world. And that fires aspirations and ambitions which will need to be curbed.\nI quote Gandhi extensively. He was a man who was ahead of his time, and he realized the dangers of pursuing exactly the same path of development. He was asked a very specific question on this. \"Mr."}
{"text":" Gandhi, don't you want India to reach the same level of prosperity as Britain?\" And his response was, \"It took Britain half the resources of the planet to get where it is. How many planets will India require?\" Here he was in the beginning of the 20th century, he foresaw the implications of continuing on this path.\nI think we also need leadership, both in the developed and the developing world, to tell us, \"Look, we've got to get off this path. It's going to create havoc if we don't make some major changes.\" I think if everyone in the developed world shows a change in direction, and starts implementing measures that are visible and credible, then this will have an influence on the developing countries as well. But as long as people's aspirations are essentially based on what they see in the developed countries, it's very difficult in a democracy to move people along a different path. And so I think you really need some degree of convergence between North and South, to be able to see that we come up with global solutions that are sustainable. I don't see that happening so far, but it must.\ne360: If you could single-handedly introduce a program to slow and reverse climate change, what specific steps would you take?\nPachauri: I'd place a high price on carbon in the economies across the globe. A cap-and-trade system has a lot of merit. But over and above that, perhaps there's a need to put taxes on those activities and those products that are highly energy intensive, or intensive in the use of resources of various kinds. An example would be like what Mayor [Ken] Livingstone has done in London. In central London he's taxed cars coming into that area to such an extent that it's made an enormous difference in traffic.\nNow, that's a win-win situation because you improve mobility. You improve local pollution and local environmental quality. You're reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses. And he is also collecting resources, which could then go to financing substitutes that are sustainable.\nSo I think one has to look at a mix of regulatory taxation, as well as other fiscal measures by which one can bring about a shift. One of the benefits of the Kyoto protocol has been the fact that at least it's begun a market for carbon, which didn't exist earlier. This wouldn't have happened but for the fact that there is a Kyoto protocol which requires countries to reduce their emissions. And they're using some market mechanisms to bring that about. I think a cap-and-trade system has merit. But that may not be enough. We may need to do much more in terms of taxation; in terms of maybe providing fiscal incentives to develop new technologies. And I think overall, if one wants to make the most efficient use of the marketplace, then we need to provide a powerful signal on the use of carbon throughout the economy.\ne360: If you had benign dictatorial powers, other than putting a price on carbon, what concrete steps would you take immediately?\nPachauri: Well, you certainly need some regulation of those particular sectors that are contributing a large amount to emissions. You can use regulation in the building industry, where perhaps the amount of energy per square foot of a certain type of building in a particular location would be limited to X kilowatt hours. And one has to do that rather judiciously. You don't want to introduce a bureaucratic overlay of things that would not actually help.\ne360: Right. Do you believe that the United States and other developed countries have an obligation to help pay for adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries? And if so, what should the developed countries be doing?\nPachauri: Well this is already there in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in the Kyoto protocol. There is such a thing as an adaptation fund which has come into existence, but there's just such a measly sum of money involved that it doesn't really get you anywhere. So I think there has to be some general effort on the part of the developed countries to help. In the end, a lot has to be provided in the way of emergency and rehabilitation assistance, all of which might prove to be much more expensive than actually preventing the problem to start with.\nLook at the problem in Sudan and Darfur. The Secretary General of the UN said that much of this problem is caused by climate change, and people chewed him up because he made that statement. But clearly, climate change is a contributing factor. All of us in the IPCC clearly bring out the fact that climate change exacerbates existing stresses, and it could literally be the last straw on the camel's back. So I think somehow we need a new spirit by which everyone understands that, really, we're all in it together.\ne360: Since the IPCC report last year, the climate-change skeptics have been noticeably quiet. I think public awareness of this issue, with your winning the Nobel Prize, has become focused. Do"}
{"text":" you think that the era of needing to convince people and the skeptics that there is in fact man-made climate change is over? Or do you think that's a debate that will still be fought in the future?\nPachauri: No, I think they [the skeptics] have probably gone into tactical retreat. I don't think this will go away. Clearly the credibility of the skeptics has been affected, and they realize they don't have the same influence that they perhaps had earlier on. But as someone associated with the IPCC, I'm not terribly worried about it, because if you go back in time, historically, every time there's new knowledge, every time there are new scientific facts which come out, there's always a backlash.\ne360: Besides the public awareness factor, what difference do you think your winning the Nobel Prize, the IPCC winning the Nobel Prize, has really made in spurring the world community to action?\nPachauri: Firstly, it certainly provides a certain level of glory and credibility to the work of the IPCC. Secondly, by drawing the link between peace and climate change, they [the Nobel committee] certainly raised an alarm. The prize has certainly raised an alarm on the cost of ignoring the problem because I think if there's one thing that human beings are really worried about,it is the danger to peace and security. That somehow comes closer to home than anything else.\ne360: Dr. Pachauri, we thank you for being with us today and talking with us about this crucial issue.\nPachauri: Thank you very much.\nJoin the conversation: A Conversation with Nobel Prize Winner Rajendra Pachauri Show comments \u2192"}

Called the Canal Solar Power Project, the project could very well use the 19,000 km-long network of Narmada canals to its advantage.\nThis Heat-electricity Conversion Storage Device is practical and stylish\nHeat energy is usually given out during the generation of electricity. However, this energy is usually allowed to go waste, without being tapped into as an additional source of renewable energy. Recently, designers Shuguang Li and Xiaoping Chen decided to make the most out of this untapped energy source and came up with a Heat-electricity Conversion Storage Device. This device uses a thermoelectric conversion material to transfer and then store electricity from heat waste.\nPosted in Alternative Energy on February 15, 2013\nWind Energy Goes Micro, with the Mini Turbine\nBritish designed and made micro turbine, the Urbine, looks set to take off. Ecotricity, Britain's first green energy company, has turned towards micro wind turbines after the poor design and performance of regular wind turbines has threatened the future of wind energy as a reliable alternative energy source. The micro turbine should be up to 40% times more efficient than its bigger brothers, provided it passes the next six months of rigorous testing planned for it in the UK. Not only would its success give the wind energy sector an ego boost, but also the flailing British economy. It is estimated that in the last ten years, almost 12,000 jobs were created in this sector.\nSolar Power Charges Wind Power Plant in Arizona\nThe Clean Wind Energy Downdraft Tower is a skyscraper-sized wind power plant powered by solar energy. It has close to zero carbon footprint, produces almost no waste and consumes virtually no fuel. By harnessing the power of the sun to make wind energy, it can be used in areas with little breeze of its own. It works like this: a fine mist of water is sprayed across the top of the hollow tower to cool hot air as it enters, as it cools, it falls more heavily and faster, so by the time it reaches wind turbines at the bottom, it is powerful enough to generate electricity.

To help combat this, business students, engineers and corporate in Ohio have put their heads together to address this issue, and come up with a very effective, but crazily expensive solar powered fridge-shed thingy that no small farmer in India would ever be able to afford! Priced at $5,000, the SolarCool runs on eight solar panels that can keep food chilled, even at night, thanks to a battery that gets charged in the daylight.\nPosted in Alternative Energy on January 29, 2013\nWind Powered Battery Storage Pilots in Texas\nDuke Energy Renewables has developed a way of saving extra power generated by batteries at its Notrees Windpower Project in Texas. The $44 million battery-storage system holds excess energy from the 153-megawatt Notrees farm and releases it when power supplies dip. This innovation is particularly helpful because winds often blow more strongly at night, when power needs are less, and more gently during the day, when power demands are higher. With this battery storage system, wind generated power can be kept and used, as and when needed, thus stablising the grid. Data from the project is being collected and analysed for scale-up by the US Department of Energy, who helped fund Duke Energy Renewables' wind power, storage battery.\nEvonik Pioneer Solar Kite Journey Across Australia\nEvonik have pioneered a solar powered journey"}

Within the first quarter of this year, Shams 1, otherwise known as the world's largest single unit concentrated solar power plant, is due to light up its facilities. It is hoped that Shams 1 will reduce carbon emissions in Abu Dhabi by 175,000 tons every year, which would be the same as taking 15,000 cars off the road. It works like this: parabolic trough collectors track the sun throughout the day, directing the sunlight onto embedded tubes filled with a synthetic oil-based heat transfer fluid. The fluid can reach up to 400 degrees celsius in the tubes, before it is heated a further 140 degrees in a natural gas powered booster. The heat is then used to boil water and produce steam for steam turbines.\nJapan Plans World's Largest Renewable Energy Farm\nThe epicentre of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan is undergoing drastic changes. Following the disaster in Fukushima, Japan is shifting its reliance on controversial nuclear power to renewable energy. The largest development is a proposal for 143 wind turbines on platforms 10 miles off the coast of Fukushima. If plans go ahead, this will be the world's largest wind farm, surpassing Britain's Greater Gabbard farm on the Suffolk coast, which has 140 wind turbines.\nPage 10 of 87\u00ab First<<7891011121314>>Last \u00bb"}

The following year it is scheduled to begin deliveries to the air transport industry, contributing to CO2 reduction.\n\"We will make Japan the leader in biofuel,\" declared Mitsuru Izumo, president and representative director of euglena Co., Ltd. of Japan, at the ceremony marking the completion of the firm's demonstration biofuel manufacturing plant in Yokohama on November 2, 2018. The plant manufactures jet fuel and diesel fuel for buses and trucks from a combination of microalgae (Euglenophyceae) and waste cooking oil. Annual production is 125 kiloliters. Full-scale production is slated to start in spring 2019, and the total investment is about 5.8 billion yen (US$ 53.2 million).\nSlashing cost to one-hundredth\nManufactured biofuel will first be supplied to buses and trucks, and in 2020 plans call for deliveries of jet fuel to commercial flights by All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. (ANA) of Japan. The firm hopes to introduce biofuel for aviation use globally, including the US, EU, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, China, and India. Worldwide, biofuels have already been used in about 150,000 commercial flights, but none in Japan.\nPresident Izumo is confident, commenting that the company will \"catch up to and surpass competitors worldwide.\" Production capacity will be boosted to 250,000 kiloliters in 2025, dropping the per-liter manufacturing cost from the current 10,000 yen to only 100 yen.\n\"The most important points for users will be quality and cost,\" adds Izumo. \"We've solved the technology development issues.\"\nWith the implementation of the Paris Agreement and adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the aviation industry is accelerating its efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a target to make 2020 the year of highest CO2 emissions for the industry overall, and hopes are high that biofuels can be effective in attaining that goal.\nOn the same date euglena also made a joint declaration for \"GREEN OIL JAPAN,\" together with companies and organizations including ANA, Chiyoda Corp. of Japan, and Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan. The goal is to seek other firms and organizations to cooperate in the manufacture and use of biofuels, promoting increased adoption as a means of contributing to SDG Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\nThe euglena demonstration plant, producing biofuel from microalgae (Euglenophyceae) and waste cooking oil.

{"text":"Tuesday | June 17th, 2014\nGiving Estimated At $335.17 Billion For 2013\nCharitable giving in the United States jumped 4.4 percent last year to an estimated $335.17 billion and was led, as usual, by individual donors supporting their favorite charities and institutions.\nAccording to new, initial estimates for 2013 released today, that's 3 percent more when adjusted for inflation from a revised estimate of $320.97 billion for 2012, according to the Giving USA Foundation and its research partner, the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.\nPreliminary estimates by Giving USA\u2122 are based on econometric models and use historical data from Forms 990 submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as sources including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Foundation Center and the National Center for Charitable Statistics. The 2013 preliminary estimates released today, which include some projections and models, will be revised annually two more times, once IRS data are compiled.\nGiving to religion remained the largest swath of giving but was flat and despite corporate earnings skyrocketing, giving by corporation declined almost 2 percent after a jump of 12 percent in 2012.\nTotal giving has increased 22 percent (12.3 percent adjusted for inflation) since the official end of the recession in 2009. Total giving again was about 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nA return to pre-recession levels for overall charitable giving might come sooner than expected while some sectors have returned to pre-recession giving. Projections at this time last year anticipated a return to pre-recession giving could be as many as six or seven years away. The new data, however, show that if giving continues at its current 4.2-percent pace over the last two years, pre-recession levels could be reached as early as 2015.\n\"It could happen within the next year, but it might take two years,\" said Patrick Rooney, Ph.D., associate dean for academic affairs and research at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. That projection could be volatile though with a big part of it depending on what happens to the stock markets, household incomes and tax policy, he added.\n\"There's reason to give pause in terms of how long it's taken us, the depth of the Great Recession and how long it's taken us to recover,\" Rooney said. \"If it takes another year or two to get back to where we were before the recession, you're basically at eight years; not a complete decade but pretty close. It's not [a lost decade] in the sense that people continue to give but lost in sense of progress,\" he said.\nIn inflation-adjusted dollars, five subsectors have reached or surpassed all-time high giving levels since the recession officially ended in mid-2009:\nEducation, $52.07 billion last year, up 8.9 percent \/ 7.4 percent for inflation;\nHuman services, $41.51 billion, up 2.2 percent \/ 0.7 percent for inflation;\nHealth, $31.86 billion, up 6 percent \/ 4.5 percent for inflation;\nFoundations, $35.74 billion, down 15.5 percent \/ 16.7 percent for inflation;\nEnvironmental\/animal, $9.72 billion, up 7.5 percent \/ 6 percent for inflation.\nGiving to public-society benefit organization was up 8.5 percent to $23.89 billion, or 7 percent when adjusted for inflation. Giving to individuals was estimated to have risen 1.4 percent, to $3.7 billion.\nGiving to religion again was the largest by total at $105.53 billion (31 percent of giving) but was flat or down for the fifth consecutive year, declining 0.2 percent, 1.6 percent when adjusted for inflation. International affairs was the only other subsector to fall, down 6.7 percent or 8 percent inflation-adjusted, to $14.93 billion (4 percent of giving).\nLast year's initial overall estimates were revised 1.5 percent higher, from an original $316.23 billion to $321 billion. Adjustments showed somewhat higher growth of about 5.4 percent in 2012 giving. Most of the difference was attributed to a change in estimated bequest giving. Originally, estimates showed a 3.5-percent increase in giving, 1.5 percent inflation-adjusted.\nAmong sources of giving, only corporate giving fell last year, down 1.9 percent or 2.2 percent inflation-adjusted, to $17.88 billion. Giving by individuals was up 4.2 percent (2.7 percent inflation adjusted) and again was the largest portion of overall giving, accounting for $240.6 billion, or 72 percent of overall giving. Giving by foundations makes up the second largest portion, at $48.96 billion, or 15 percent, and increased 5.7 percent last year, 4.2 percent when adjusted for inflation. Giving by bequest was up 8.7"}
{"text":" percent, 7.2 percent adjusted for inflation, to $27.73 billion.\nThe aggregate rate of growth for education since the recession has been about three times that of the charitable sector, which John Lippincott attributes to several fundamental advantages that the education sector enjoys and does a good job of using. \"Education for a long time has made a strong investment in fundraising operations so they've got the infrastructure, databases and staff in place, and they've been very good at developing high-level professionalism within staff that they hire,\" said the president and CEO of the Council for Aid and Support to Education (CASE).\nEducation can appeal to a broad array of donor interests, touching on research or economic development as well as education, while most other subsectors are very specific. \"We saw this within CASE membership, education was very persistent during the recession, in terms of maintaining relationship with donors, even during a period of time when those donors were not in a position to make a gift, or the same gift as in past,\" Lippincott said.\nThe clearest message in the numbers for Lippincott is perseverance. \"The fact that institutions that kept the faith during the recession are now seeing the rewards for that, that for me is the real takeaway and a real important message,\" he said.\nOrganizations might experiment with fundraising, try it for a couple years, stop, get mixed results or be disappointed. \"You have to be in the long haul, and be persistent, to see the big payoff. That's the key message behind 8 and 9 percent growth,\" he said.\nIrv Katz, president of the National Human Services Assembly in Washington, D.C., is disappointed in the small increase among human services nonprofits. A former advisor to Giving USA, Katz said some of the \"borders between these categories are a little more permeable,\" and some of his members might be included health, public-society benefit or religion.\nThere is a strong correlation between giving in general and attendance at houses of worship. \"People who actively practice faith are more generous toward human services and the charitable type of service. It could speak to why neither human service and religion are growing that rapidly,\" he said.\nIf the pace continues, the arts, culture and humanities subsector could be the next area that reaches pre-recession levels, said L. Gregg Carlson, chair of the Giving USA Foundation and president of Henderson, Nev.-based Carlson Fund Raising. In the midst of the recession, there was some reprioritizing of charitable giving to human services organizations that met basic needs. \"The opera didn't need their gift that year, the soup kitchen did,\" Carlson said, which would explain the big jumps for human services charities in 2009 and 2010 while arts groups took a hit.\nIt wasn't all good news coming out of the newest estimates. Some observers had their concerns. For Lippincott, the challenge is the \"increasing economic stratification\" among donors that's mirrored in general society. For example, alumni giving continues to increase but alumni participation has dropped, meaning the same number or fewer alumni are giving more money. Likewise, charities in general are raising money from a shrinking donor universe.\nThe vast student debt also plays into the scenario. Students graduating with significant debt are going to inevitably be less inclined to make even modest contributions, Lippincott said. \"If that habit or tradition of giving is not established early, it's hard to recapture it later,\" he said.\nAnd while there may be more confidence in the economy, and signs that it's growing, there are still large numbers of people struggling.\n\"People don't perceive the human crisis as critical as they had at the height of the Great Recession,\" said Katz.\nThe fact that many more middle-income people have sustained long-term unemployment and lower standards of living is not very visible. \"A large cadre of families that are continuing to endure tough economic times but they're not visible,\" Katz said. \"They are your neighbors. They may not be using the traditional relief entities like people who've been living with poverty for a long time. I think it's below the surface.\"\n\u00ab H.W.

{"text":"In The Moral Austerity of Environmental Decision Making a group of prominent environmental ethicists, policy analysts, political theorists, and legal experts challenges the dominating influence of market principles and assumptions on the formulation of environmental policy. Emphasizing the concept of sustainability and the centrality of moral deliberation to democracy, they examine the possibilities for a wider variety of moral principles to play an active role in defining \"good\" environmental decisions. If environmental policy is to be responsible to humanity and to nature in the twenty-first century, they argue, it is imperative that the discourse acknowledge and integrate additional normative assumptions and principles other than those endorsed by the market paradigm.\nThe contributors search for these assumptions and principles in short arguments and debates over the role of science, social justice, instrumental value, and intrinsic value in contemporary environmental policy. In their discussion of moral alternatives to enrich environmental decision making and in their search for a less austere and more robust role for normative discourse in practical policy making, they analyze a series of original case studies that deal with environmental sustainability and natural resources policy including pollution, land use, environmental law, globalism, and public lands. The unique structure of the book\u2014which features the core contributors responding in a discourse format to the central chapters' essays and debates\u2014helps to highlight the role personal and public values play in democratic decision making generally and in the field of environmental politics specifically.\nJohn Martin Gillroy is MacArthur Professor of Environmental Policy and Law at Bucknell University.\nJoe Bowersox is Associate Professor of Politics at Willamette University.\nIssue 1: Science as a Substitute for Moral Principles?\nIssue 2: Environmental Justice without Social Justice?\nIssue 3: A Sustainable Environment as an Instrumental Value?\nIssue 4: A Sustainable Environment as an Intrinsic Value?"}
{"text":"The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power. Wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electricity generated: far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity, so wind power helps limit climate change. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.\n\nOnshore (on-land) wind farms can have a significant visual impact and impact on the landscape. Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements, wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations. Their network of turbines, access roads, transmission lines, and substations can result in \"energy sprawl\";  although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture.\n\nConflicts arise especially in scenic and culturally-important landscapes. Siting restrictions (such as setbacks) may be implemented to limit the impact. The land between the turbines and access roads can still be used for farming and grazing. They can lead to \"industrialization of the countryside\". Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas, archaeological landscapes and heritage sites. A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views.\n\nHabitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms, but they are small and can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented. The worldwide ecological impact is minimal. Thousands of birds and bats, including rare species, have been killed by wind turbine blades, as there are around other manmade structures, though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations. This can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring.\n\nMany wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass and some only had a lifetime of 10 to 20 years. Previously, there was no market for recycling these old blades, and they were commonly disposed of in landfills. Because blades are hollow, they take up a large volume compared to their mass. Since 2019, some landfill operators have begun requiring blades to be crushed before being landfilled. Blades manufactured in the 2020s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable.\n\nWind turbines also generate noise. At a distance of  this may be around 45\u00a0dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At  distance they become inaudible. There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims. Pile-driving to construct non-floating wind farms is noisy underwater, but in operation offshore wind is much quieter than ships.\n\nBasic operational considerations\n\nPollution and effects on the grid\n\nPollution costs \nCompared with other low-carbon power sources, wind turbines have one of the lowest global warming potentials per unit of electrical energy generated by any power source. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 15 and 11 (geq\/kWh) depending on whether offshore or onshore turbines are being assessed.\n\nWind power doesn't consume water for continuous operation and has near negligible emissions directly related to its electricity production. Wind turbines when isolated from the electric grid, produce negligible amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury and radioactive waste when in operation, unlike fossil fuel sources and nuclear energy station fuel production, respectively.\n\nWith the construction phase largely to blame, wind turbines emit slightly more particulate matter (PM), a form of air pollution, at an \"exception\" rate higher per unit of energy generated(kWh) than a fossil gas electricity station(\"NGCC\"), and also emit more heavy metals and PM than nuclear stations, per unit of energy generated. Wind power externality costs are negligible compared to the cost of electricity generation.\n\nFindings when connected to the grid \n\nA typical study of a wind farm's Life cycle assessment, when not connected to the electric grid, usually results in similar findings as the following 2006 analysis of 3 installations in the US Midwest, where the carbon dioxide () emissions of wind power ranged from  per GWh (14\u201333 g\/kWh) of energy produced, with most of the  emission intensity coming from producing steel, concrete, and plastic\/fiberglass composites for the turbine structure and foundation. By combining similar data from numerous individual studies in a meta-analysis, the median global warming potential for wind power was found to be 11\u201312\u00a0g CO2\/kWh and unlikely to change significantly.\n\nThis higher dependence on back-up\/Load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the"}
{"text":" knock-on-effect of more frequent inefficient (in e g\/kWh) throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent power source's variable output. When one includes the total effect of intermittent sources on other power sources in the grid system, that is, including these inefficient start up emissions of backup power sources to cater for wind energy, into wind energy's total system-wide life cycle, this results in a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity. Higher than the direct g\/kWh value that is determined from looking at the power source in isolation and thus ignores all down-stream detrimental\/inefficiency effects it has on the grid.\nThis higher dependence on back-up\/Load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output forces fossil power plants to operate in less efficient states.\n\nIn comparison to other low carbon power sources wind turbines, when assessed in isolation, have a median life cycle emission value of between 11 and 12 (geq\/kWh). While an increase in emissions due to the practical issues of load balancing is an issue, Pehnt et al. still conclude that these 20 and 80\u00a0g CO2-eq\/kWh added penalties still result in wind being roughly ten times less polluting than fossil gas and coal which emit ~400 and 900\u00a0g CO2-eq\/kWh respectively. As these losses occur due to the cycling of fossil power plants, they may at some point become smaller when more than 20\u201330% of wind energy is added to the power grid, as fossil power plants are replaced, however this has yet to occur in practice.\n\nRare-earth use \n\nThe production of permanent magnets used in some wind turbines makes use of neodymium.  Pollution concerns associated with the extraction of this rare-earth element, which is primarily exported by China, have prompted government action in recent years, and international research attempts to refine the extraction process. Research is underway on turbine and generator designs which reduce the need for neodymium, or eliminate the use of rare-earth metals altogether. Additionally, the large wind turbine manufacturer Enercon GmbH chose very early not to use permanent magnets for its direct drive turbines, to avoid responsibility for the adverse environmental impact of rare-earth mining.\n\nMaterial inputs \nInternational Energy Agency study projects the demand for mined resources such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, copper, nickel and rare earths will rise 4x by 2040 and notes insufficient supply of these materials to match demand imposed by expected large-scale deployments of decentralized technologies solar and wind power, and required grid upgrades. For example, an on-shore wind farm requires 9x more materials than a similar fossil gas plant. According to a 2018 study significant increase of wind power would require 1000% increase in supply of these metals by 2060, requiring significant increase in mining operations.\n\nWaste, recycling, repurposing \nModern wind turbine blades are made from plastic\/fiberglass composite designs that provide a service lifetime of less than about 20 years. , there was no economical technology and market for recycling these old blades, and the most common disposal procedure is to truck them to landfills. Other options for disposing of the blades includes incinerating the material or grinding it up into powder, but both of these methods are not only expensive, but also inefficient and involves additional energy usage. Blade incineration emits a significant amount of green house gases, though it can be used as a source of heat and power, which somewhat offsets these emissions. Because of their hollow design for less weight, blades can take up an enormous volume compared to their mass, making road transport difficult, expensive, and dangerous due to wide turning berths, extra safety vehicles, and longer flatbed trucks.\n\nSince many blades are still trashed, landfill operators have started requiring blades to be cut to pieces and sometimes crushed before they can be landfilled, which consumes further energy. Along with ongoing development work to extend the generating efficiency and service life of newer turbines, blade recycling solutions continue to be pursued that are economical, energy efficient, and market scalable.\n\nThere may be as much as 45% additional waste resulting from processes that occur during the lifecycle of the turbine blades, and it is estimated that total annual blade waste of all countries may reach 2.9 million tons by 2050. In comparison, global solar photovoltaic cell waste is expected to reach about 78 million tons by 2050.\n\nRecycling and repurposing \n\nAs much as 80% of the wind turbine structure can be recycled, though this does not include the foundation of the structure, which is typically made from reinforced concrete, or the blades. Alternatively, these components of the turbine structure that are not easily recycled into new turbines can still be repurposed and used in other ways.\n\nThe large volume of the turbine blades, while difficult to handle, is advantageous in repurposing the blades as playground structures, bike"}
{"text":" shelters and footbridges. Other recycling methods include creating pellets for waterproof boards and injectable plastics, as well as pyrolysis for producing paints, glues, and both cement and concrete.\nCarbon fiber blades can now be recycled, the fiber first being separated from the epoxy resin binder, then chopped into small particles. After the separation, the resin is used as a fuel source for the next materials to be processed. After pyrolysis, the resulting material can be further separated and the glass fibers extracted to be used in insulation or fiber reinforcement.\n\nThe blades may also be repurposed into building materials and structural components. Research indicates that turbine blades could successfully be repurposed as electrical transmission poles as their strength and structural stability was found to be comparable to the materials that are typically used. Sections of the blades have been adapted to create roofs for small houses and these structures meet the requirements of building codes and may prove to be a viable way to reuse blade materials without extensive processes needed to make the material usable. Components of the turbine could be reused by implementing segmentation, where the object is divided into different elements. Research on segmentation suggests that the resulting materials are better than conventional construction materials when measuring specific flexural stiffness and flexural strength.\n\nOverall, there are several different avenues through which wind turbine components can be recycled, reused, or repurposed, all with their advantages and disadvantages, and there continues to be research conducted to determine even more ways that the materials can economically utilized. While various methods for recycling or repurposing the turbine blades have been proven effective, they have not been implemented on a large enough scale to adequately address the rapidly rising amounts of turbine blade waste being produced.\n\nAlternative building materials \nIn addition to carbon fiber blades sometimes being installed due to lower weight and higher strength and durability compared to fiberglass-epoxy composites, as of 2020 there is now a wind turbine with a modular wooden structural support trunk in Gothenburg, Sweden, which is stronger, lighter, easier to recycle and transport, and more carbon-neutral than steel. These wooden towers would not need to be recycled as often as steel due to their fire-resistance and higher tolerance of metal-oxidizing chemicals. Other alternative building materials include recyclable polymers (thermoplastic, recyclable thermosets, polyurethane), bamboo, natural fiber composites, biodegradable resins, and bio-based carbon fibers.\n\nResearch on wind turbine materials also focuses on how to make the turbine blades more resistant to damage as this would extend their lifespan and reduce the replacement turnover (frequency of replacements). In addition to adapting the materials used in the blades to increase their resistance to damage, there are also potential methods of altering the turbine's activity during certain weather events in order to decrease any damage caused by wind or rain.\n\nEcology\n\nLand use \nWind power has low life-cycle surface power density of 1.84 W\/m2 which is three orders of magnitude (103 times, which is equivalent to 1,000x) less than nuclear or fossil fuel power and 3x less than PV.\n\nWind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms are minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind farms are decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition.\n\nA study by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory of US wind farms built between 2000 and 2009 found that, on average, only 1.1 percent of the total wind farm area suffered surface disturbance, and only 0.43 percent was permanently disturbed by wind power installations. On average, there were  of total wind farm area per MW of capacity, but only  of permanently disturbed area per MW of wind power capacity.\n\nIn the UK many prime wind farm sites \u2013 locations with the best average wind speeds \u2013 are in upland areas that are frequently covered by blanket bog. This type of habitat exists in areas of relatively high rainfall where large areas of land remain permanently sodden. Construction work may create a risk of disruption to peatland hydrology which could cause localised areas of peat within the area of a wind farm to dry out, disintegrate, and so release their stored carbon. At the same time, the warming climate which renewable energy schemes seek to mitigate could itself pose an existential threat to peatlands throughout the UK. A Scottish MEP campaigned for a moratorium on wind developments on peatlands saying that \"Damaging the peat causes the release of more carbon dioxide than wind farms save\". A 2014 report for the Northern Ireland Environment Agency noted that siting wind turbines on peatland could release considerable carbon dioxide from the peat, and also damage the peatland contributions to flood control and water quality: \"The potential knock-on effects of using the peatland resource for wind turbines are considerable and it is arguable that"}
{"text":" the impacts on this facet of biodiversity will have the most noticeable and greatest financial implications for Northern Ireland.\" Wind farm construction near wetlands has been linked to several bog landslides in Ireland that have polluted rivers, such as at Derrybrien (2003) and Meenbog (2020). Such incidents could be prevented with stricter planning procedures and siting guidelines.\n\nWind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land is used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% can still be used for farming. A wind turbine needs about 200\u2013400\u00a0m2 for the foundation. With the increasing size of the wind turbine the relative size of the foundation decreases. Critics point out that on some locations in forests the clearing of trees around tower bases may be necessary for installation sites on mountain ridges, such as in the northeastern U.S. This usually takes the clearing of 5,000\u00a0m2 per wind turbine.\n\nDuring construction of wind farms in Scotland in 2007\u20132008 over 3.4 million trees were removed on 6202 acres of forest, out of which 31.5% has been replanted.\n\nTurbines are not generally installed in urban areas. Buildings interfere with the wind, turbines must be sited a safe distance (\"setback\") from residences in case of failure, and the value of land is high. There are a few notable exceptions to this. The WindShare ExPlace wind turbine was erected in December 2002, on the grounds of Exhibition Place, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre. Steel Winds also has a 20 MW urban project south of Buffalo, New York. Both of these projects are in urban locations, but benefit from being on uninhabited lakeshore property.\n\nIn Greece, wind turbine sites have been installed \"on mountain peaks, in forests, near archaeological sites, on islands, in protected habitats\" and in highly populated tourist areas, causing disruption to hospitality business and protests of residents.\n\nLivestock \nThe land can still be used for farming and cattle grazing. Livestock is unaffected by the presence of wind farms. International experience shows that livestock will \"graze right up to the base of wind turbines and often use them as rubbing posts or for shade\".\n\nIn 2014, a first of its kind veterinary study attempted to determine the effects of rearing livestock near a wind turbine, the study compared the health effects of a wind turbine on the development of two groups of growing geese, preliminary results found that geese raised within 50 meters of a wind turbine gained less weight and had a higher concentration of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood than geese at a distance of 500 meters.\n\nSemi-domestic reindeer avoid the construction activity, but seem unaffected when the turbines are operating.\n\nImpact on wildlife \n\nEnvironmental assessments are routinely carried out for wind farm proposals, and potential impacts on the local environment (e.g. plants, animals, soils) are evaluated. Turbine locations and operations are often modified as part of the approval process to avoid or minimise impacts on threatened species and their habitats. Any unavoidable impacts can be offset with conservation improvements of similar ecosystems which are unaffected by the proposal.\n\nA research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, suggests modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and residential wildlife with respect to geographic features and weather, to provide a basis for science-based decisions about where to site new wind projects. More specifically, it suggests:\n Use existing data on migratory and other movements of wildlife to develop predictive models of risk.\n Use new and emerging technologies, including radar, acoustics, and thermal imaging, to fill gaps in knowledge of wildlife movements.\n Identify specific species or sets of species most at risk in areas of high potential wind resources.\nWind turbines, like many other human activities and buildings, also increase the death rate of avian creatures such as birds and bats. A summary of the existing field studies compiled in 2010 from the National Wind Coordinating Collaborative identified fewer than 14 and typically less than four bird deaths per installed megawatt per year, but a wider variation in the number of bat deaths.  Like other investigations, it concluded that some species (e.g. migrating bats and songbirds) are known to be harmed more than others and that factors such as turbine siting can be important. However, many details, as well as the overall impact from the growing number of turbines, remain unclear. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory maintains a database of the scientific literature on the subject.\n\nBirds \nThe impact of wind energy on birds, which can fly into turbines, or have their habitats degraded by wind development, is complex. Displacement is thought to be more of a threat to species than collisions. Habitat loss is highly variable between species.\n\nHundreds"}
{"text":" of thousands of birds, including raptors and migrants, are killed each year because of wind turbines and their power lines, but this is less than the number killed (or not born) because of fossil fuel (coal and gas) power stations. Wind farms are estimated to be responsible for losing less than 0.4 birds per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity generated, compared to over 5 birds per GWh for fossil fueled power stations. As well as threatening extinction, one of the effects of climate change is to already cause a decline in bird population, and this is the main cause of bird loss from fossil power.\n\nOn some important migration routes turbines are banned, or birds may alter their flight paths to avoid them. Biological surveys beforehand and correctly siting turbines is very important, especially for raptors as they are slow to breed. Methods to help birds avoid turbines include painting of one of the turbine blades black, and making ultrasonic noise. Some approaching birds can be spotted, for example by avian radar, in time for turbines to be slowed to a speed which is safe for them. Wind farms may need more power lines, and lines may be made less damaging to compensate. Making permits for the number of birds (such as eagles) killed tradeable has been suggested, in order to save the most birds at the least cost.\n\nBats \n\nBats may be injured by direct impact with turbine blades, towers, or transmission lines. Recent research shows that bats may also be killed when suddenly passing through a low air pressure region surrounding the turbine blade tips. The numbers of bats killed by existing onshore and near-shore facilities have troubled bat enthusiasts. In April 2009 the Bats and Wind Energy Cooperative released initial study results showing a 73% drop in bat fatalities when wind farm operations are stopped during low wind conditions, when bats are most active. Bats avoid radar transmitters, and placing microwave transmitters on wind turbine towers may reduce the number of bat collisions.\n\nIt is hypothesized that a portion of bat fatalities are attributed to the wind displacement caused by the wind turbine blades as they move through the air causing insects in the area to become disoriented making it a dense area of prey \u2013 an attractive hunting ground for bats. To combat this phenomenon ultrasonic deterrents have been tested on select wind turbines and has been shown to reduce bat fatalities from collision and barotrauma.  Testing of the ultrasonic deterrents has shown significantly reduced bat activity around wind turbines; according to study done in Zzyzyx, California, bat activity was reduced by 89.6\u201397.5% when ultrasonic acoustic deterrents were used.\n\nA 2013 study produced an estimate that wind turbines killed more than 600,000 bats in the U.S. the previous year, with the greatest mortality occurring in the Appalachian Mountains. Some earlier studies had produced estimates of between 33,000 and 888,000 bat deaths per year.Mortality, specifically in migratory birds and bats, seems to be increased in locations where wind patterns seem to facilitate both migration paths and energy production.\n\nMarine life\nWind farms designed to be more efficient from lack of airflow-impeding obstacles, offshore wind farms, have altered marine ecosystems by providing refuge from humans in the form of fishing-restricted areas due to safety concerns of moving blades. Interestingly, the regions of refuge are not directly at the location of the wind turbines but rather slightly closer to shore.  As an example, new colonies of Blue Mussels in the North Sea fed by phytoplankton are a food source for other predators, namely fish and crabs, and further up the food chain, pinnipeds, colloquially known as seals. Blue Mussels also reduce turbidity in the ocean water, making for greater underwater visibility, and leave behind their shells as shelter, further altering possible inhabitants of their coastal domain.\n\nWeather and climate change \n\nWind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity. Turbulence from spinning wind turbine rotors increases vertical mixing of heat and water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind, including rainfall. Overall, wind farms lead to a slight warming at night and a slight cooling during the day time. This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence. Warming at night could \"benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season. Many farmers already do this with air circulators\".\n\nA number of studies have used climate models to study the effect of extremely large wind farms. One study reports simulations that show detectable changes in global climate for very high wind farm usage, on the order of 10% of the world's land area. Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver \"enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of  and air pollutants\". Another peer-reviewed study suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could actually have a warming effect, causing temperatures"}
{"text":" to rise by  in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of. Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study \"as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research\".  \"We're not pessimistic about wind,\" he said. \"We haven't absolutely proven this effect, and we'd rather see that people undertake further research\".\n\nAnother study by David Keith and Lee Miller on climactic impacts of wind power which predicted warming when considering the area of the United States has been criticized by Mark Z. Jacobson on the grounds of its limited geographical scope, with the argument that a large-scale wind energy extraction would significantly lower global temperatures.\n\nImpacts on people\n\nAesthetics \n\nAesthetic considerations of wind power stations have often a significant role in their evaluation process. To some, the perceived  aesthetic aspects of wind power stations may conflict with the protection of historical sites. Wind power stations are less likely to be perceived negatively in urbanized and industrial regions. Aesthetic issues are subjective and some people find wind farms pleasant or see them as symbols of energy independence and local prosperity. While studies in Scotland predict wind farms will damage tourism, in other countries some wind farms have themselves become tourist attractions, with several having visitor centers at ground level or even observation decks atop turbine towers.\n\nIn the 1980s, wind energy was being discussed as part of a soft energy path. Renewable energy commercialization led to an increasing industrial image of wind power, which is being criticized by various stakeholders in the planning process, including nature protection associations. Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations. Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses.\n\nCoastal areas and areas of higher altitude such as ridgelines are considered prime for wind farms, due to constant wind speeds. However, both locations tend to be areas of high visual impact and can be a contributing factor in local communities' resistance to some projects. Both the proximity to densely populated areas and the necessary wind speeds make coastal locations ideal for wind farms.\n\nWind power stations can impact on important sight relations which are a key part of culturally important landscapes, such as in the Rhine Gorge or Moselle valley. Conflicts between the heritage status of certain areas and wind power projects have arisen in various countries. In 2011 UNESCO raised concerns regarding a proposed wind farm 17 kilometres away from the French island abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel. In Germany, the impact of wind farms on valuable cultural landscapes has implications on zoning and land-use planning. For example, sensitive parts of the Moselle valley and the background of the Hambach Castle, according to the plans of the state government, will be kept free of wind turbines.\n\nWind turbines require aircraft warning lights, which may create light pollution. Complaints about these lights have caused the US FAA to consider allowing fewer lights per turbine in certain areas. Residents near turbines may complain of \"shadow flicker\" caused by rotating turbine blades, when the sun passes behind the turbine. This can be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or by turning the turbine off for the time of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker. If a turbine is poorly sited and adjacent to many homes, the duration of shadow flicker on a neighbourhood can last hours.\n\nNoise \n\nWind turbines also generate noise, and at a residential distance of  this may be around 45\u00a0dB; however, at a distance of, most wind turbines become inaudible. Loud or persistent noise increases stress which could then lead to diseases. Wind turbines do not affect human health with their noise when properly placed. However, when improperly sited, data from the monitoring of two groups of growing geese revealed substantially lower body weights and higher concentrations of a stress hormone in the blood of the first group of geese who were situated 50 meters away compared to a second group which was at a distance of 500 meters from the turbine.\n\nA 2014 study by Health Canada  involving 1238 households (representing 79 percent of the households in the geographic area studied) and 4000 hours of testing in Ontario and on Prince Edward Island includes the following supportive statements of wind turbine low frequency noise annoyance in its summary:\n\n\"Wind turbines emit low frequency noise, which can enter the home with little or no reduction in energy, potentially resulting in.. annoyance.\"\n\nRegarding the comparison of low frequency wind turbine noise annoyance to transportation noise annoyance, the Health Canada study summary states:  \"Studies have consistently shown.. that, in comparison to the scientific literature on noise annoyance"}
{"text":" to transportation noise sources such as rail or road traffic, community annoyance with (low frequency) wind turbine noise begins at a lower sound level and increases more rapidly with increasing wind turbine noise.\"\n\nThe summary also includes the following three findings of its own study:\n\n\"Statistically significant exposure-response relationships were found between increasing wind turbine noise levels and the prevalence of reporting high annoyance. These associations were found with annoyance due to noise, vibrations, blinking lights, shadow and visual impacts from wind turbines. In all cases, annoyance increased with increasing exposure to wind turbine noise levels.\"\n\n\"Community annoyance was observed to drop at distances between 1\u20132 kilometers (0.6 to 1.2 miles) in Ontario.\"  (It dropped off at 550 meters (1\/3 mile) on Prince Edward Island.)\n\n\"Annoyance was significantly lower among the 110 participants who received personal benefit, which could include rent, payments or other indirect benefits of having wind turbines in the area e.g., community improvements.\"\n\nThe above Health Canada summary states that \"no statistically significant association was observed between measured blood pressure, resting heart rate, (hair cortisol concentrations) and wind turbine noise exposure.\"\n\nWind turbine syndrome, a psychosomatic disorder, pertains to the belief that low frequency wind turbine noise, either directly or through annoyance, causes or contributes to various measurable health effects related to anxiety, for which there is little general evidence.\n\nOffshore \n\nMany offshore wind farms have contributed to electricity needs in Europe and Asia for years, and as of 2014 the first offshore wind farms are under development in U.S. waters. While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades, especially in Europe, there is still some uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment.\n\nTraditional offshore wind turbines are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the near-shore marine environment. As offshore wind technologies become more advanced, floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist.\n\nCommon environmental concerns associated with offshore wind developments include:\n The risk to seabirds being struck by wind turbine blades or being displaced from critical habitats;\n Underwater noise associated with the installation process of monopile turbines;\n The physical presence of offshore wind farms altering the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and seabirds by reasons of either attraction or avoidance;\n Potential disruption of the near-field and far-field marine environments from large offshore wind projects.\n\nGermany restricts underwater noise during pile driving to less than 160 dB.\n\nDue to the landscape protection status of large areas of the Wadden Sea, a major World Heritage Site with various national parks (e.g. Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park) German offshore installations are mostly restricted on areas outside the territorial waters. Offshore capacity in Germany is therefore way behind the British or Danish near coast installments, which face much lower restrictions.\n\nIn 2009, a comprehensive government environmental study of coastal waters in the United Kingdom concluded that there is scope for between 5,000 and 7,000 offshore wind turbines to be installed without an adverse impact on the marine environment. The studywhich forms part of the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessmentis based on more than a year's research. It included analysis of seabed geology, as well as surveys of sea birds and marine mammals. There does not seem to have been much consideration however of the likely impact of displacement of fishing activities from traditional fishing grounds.\n\nA study published in 2014 suggests that some seals prefer to hunt near turbines, likely due to the laid stones functioning as artificial reefs which attract invertebrates and fish.\n\nOffshore wind is similar to terrestrial wind technologies, as a large windmill-like turbine located in a fresh or saltwater environment. Wind causes the blades to rotate, which is then turned into electricity and connected to the grid with cables. The advantages of offshore wind are that winds are stronger and more consistent, allowing turbines of much larger size to be erected by vessels. The disadvantages are the difficulties of placing a structure in a dynamic ocean environment.\n\nThe turbines are often scaled-up versions of existing land technologies. However, the foundations are unique to offshore wind and are listed below:\n\nMonopile foundation \n\nMonopile foundations are used in shallow depth applications (0\u201330 m) and consist of a pile being driven to varying depths into the seabed (10\u201340 m) depending on the soil conditions. The pile-driving construction process is an environmental concern as the noise produced is incredibly loud and propagates far in the water, even after mitigation strategies such as bubble shields, slow start, and acoustic cladding. The footprint is relatively small, but may still cause scouring or artificial reefs. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.\n\nTripod fixed bottom \n\nT"}
{"text":"ripod fixed bottom foundations are used in transitional depth applications (20\u201380 m) and consist of three legs connecting to a central shaft that supports the turbine base. Each leg has a pile driven into the seabed, though less depth is necessary because of the wide foundation. The environmental effects are a combination of those for monopile and gravity foundations.\n\nGravity foundation \n\nGravity foundations are used in shallow depth applications (0\u201330 m) and consist of a large and heavy base constructed of steel or concrete to rest on the seabed. The footprint is relatively large and may cause scouring, artificial reefs, or physical destruction of habitat upon introduction. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.\n\nGravity tripod \n\nGravity tripod foundations are used in transitional depth applications (10\u201340 m) and consist of two heavy concrete structures connected by three legs, one structure sitting on the seabed while the other is above the water. As of 2013, no offshore windfarms are currently using this foundation. The environmental concerns are identical to those of gravity foundations, though the scouring effect may be less significant depending on the design.\n\nFloating structure \n\nFloating structure foundations are used in deep depth applications (40\u2013900 m) and consist of a balanced floating structure moored to the seabed with fixed cables. The floating structure may be stabilized using buoyancy, the mooring lines, or a ballast. The mooring lines may cause minor scouring or a potential for collision. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.\n\nSee also \n Environmental movement\n Environmental effects of coal\n Environmental effects of nuclear power\n Environmental issues with energy\n Low-carbon economy\n Renewable energy debate\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n NWCC.

The UN Security Council has issued a statement underlining \"the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of terrorism to justice\" and urged \"all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Afghan authorities\". UNAMA has denounced the senseless violence and stated that \"the use of high explosives in civilian populated areas, in circumstances almost certain to cause immense suffering to civilians, may amount to war crimes.\"\nSuch attacks clearly show the Taliban's weakness to meet Afghan forces on the battle ground due to the recent setbacks suffered by them, and their desperate attempts to terrorize the population by resorting to these violent attacks against defenseless civilians, including women and children.\nWhile Afghanistan's arms will always remain open for peace, our brave National Security and Defense Forces will spare no efforts to defeat terrorists and their supporters, financiers, and organizers.\nAfghanistan shall remain a strong and reliable partner with the international community in the fight against terrorism.\nThe Permanent Mission of the I.R. of Afghanistan expresses its deep sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of the victims and wishes the injured a speedy recovery.\nContact: Mr. Nazifullah Salarzai.

{"text":"Shutting down middle and blue-collar America\nFrom Biden to Warren, Democrat president wannabes push job-killing pseudo-green policies\nVocal activists increasingly drive Democrat Party positions across the public policy spectrum. Print, television, social and click-bait media generally support them, while permitting little debate on liberal proposals or their potential ramifications. Even semi-moderate Joe Biden has been pressured into shifting or flipping his positions on abortion, energy, climate change and other issues, to satisfy far-left factions.\nTheir policy prescriptions often find ready acceptance in coastal, urban, academic, media and big government circles. But factory workers, blue collar families and Middle America better pay very close attention to how climate change scare stories and proposed Green New Deal programs will impact their energy costs and reliability, jobs, living standards, mobility and personal choices. Warning signs abound.\nReflecting heavy dependence on wind and solar power, German and British electricity prices are already three to four times higher than what the vast majority of American households currently pay \u2013 and rising. The exorbitant prices have largely shuttered the UK's aluminum industry and what's left of its steel industry. Combined with ever-tougher carbon dioxide emission limits, factory operating costs similarly \"threaten the very existence\" of Germany's automobile industry, Volkswagen's CEO laments.\nNearly 350,000 German families have had their electricity cut off because they cannot afford to pay their power bills. German families and businesses had to cope with 172,000 localized blackouts in 2017. The country has banned fracking (hydraulic fracturing) and imports US coal and Russian natural gas.\nIn Britain more than 3,000 elderly people die every year because they cannot heat their homes properly, exposing them to constant chilly temperatures that make them more likely to contract and succumb to respiratory or heart disease. The situation is likely to get even worse. In stark contrast, abundant natural gas supplies from the fracking revolution have driven prices down in the USA, saving some 11,000 American lives each winter, according to a recent National Bureau of Economic Research study.\nMultiple widespread blackouts over a three-month period in South Australia were caused by the elimination of coal-fired power, 52% reliance on wind turbines, storms, grid instability, and an inability to predict weather conditions or peak power demand. In May 2019, they helped persuade Aussie voters to replace their climate-obsessed government with a conservative coalition that supports fossil fuels.\nChina, India and other overseas aluminum, steel and vehicle exporters to the EU and US face no climate-driven energy price or emission obstacles. The Paris Climate Agreement does not obligate them to reduce their fossil fuel use or emissions for decades to come, if ever. Indeed, China's annual increase in \"greenhouse gas\" emissions is greater than Australia's total annual nationwide emissions!\nAsia's total GHG emissions now dwarf the USA's. So even total, painful, job-killing, economy-shackling elimination of US fossil fuels would do nothing to end the steady rise in atmospheric CO2 levels.\nUnfortunately, these hard realities have had no effect on people or companies that expect to benefit politically or financially from legislated energy upheavals rooted in manmade climate change alarmism.\nNew Mexico recently joined California and Hawaii in mandating \"renewable\" electricity: 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2050. Despite the absence of any state mandate, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company wants to replace 1,850 megawatts of affordable 24\/7 coal-based electricity with 1,650 MW of expensive, intermittent, weather-dependent wind and solar, plus 1,500 MW of backup batteries.\nModern factories, offices, hospitals, schools, households and cities cannot function or survive on starvation energy diets like these. Moreover, claims that wind, solar and battery technologies are clean, climate-friendly, renewable and sustainable are little more than useful fairy tales.\nWind and solar energy are certainly renewable and perpetual. However, the massive amounts of land and raw materials required to harness, store and utilize that energy certainly are not. And many rare earth elements, lithium, cadmium, cobalt and other high-tech metals are extracted and processed by Chinese companies under zero to minimal child labor, fair wage, worker safety and environmental standards.\nBut all this generally gets swept under the rug, while tsunamis of climate chaos scare stories terrorize children and even a lot of adults into believing human civilization, wildlife and even our planet face annihilation in less than twenty years, unless the world quickly rids itself of fossil fuels.\nFrom Kamala Harris to Bernie Sanders, and now Joe Biden, every Democrat presidential candidate supports some version of the Green New Deal and would have us believe its authoritarian edicts and multi-trillion-dollar price tag are affordable and necessary.\nHelping to drive this narrative is billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 proud owner of twelve houses, a private jet and helicopter, and a fleet of pricey cars."}
{"text":" He intends to give the Sierra Club and other activist groups $500 million to conduct new campaigns to eradicate coal power and block construction of natural gas-fired generators that would otherwise replace coal-fired plants.\nIn fact, no sooner is one example of climate nonsense debunked, than another dozen take its place.\nAfter decades of frightening visitors with tall tales that Glacier National Park glaciers would all melt away by 2020 or soon thereafter, park rangers are finally acknowledging that the Grinnell, Jackson and other glaciers have actually been growing since 2010. They are now (quietly) removing signs, videos and brochures that featured the (Al) Gorey claims about catastrophic (Michael) Mann-made global warming.\nEven the Washington Post has acknowledged that the number of violent (F4-5) tornadoes has declined 40% between the 1950-1984 period and 1985-2018 interval \u2013 with not one violent tornado recorded in the USA in 2018, for the first time in history. The United States also enjoyed a record 12-year absence of Category 3-5 hurricanes making landfall, between Wilma in 2005 and Harvey in 2017. Overall, actual evidence shows no upward trend in extreme weather, floods, droughts or sea level rise.\nSo now we're being told plant and animal species are disappearing 100 times faster than historic rates, because of manmade climate change \u2013 and a million or more are at risk of extinction \u2026 out of some eight million that a new UN report claims exist on Earth. There are serious problems with this latest hysteria.\nScientists have actually identified and named only 1.8 million plant and animal species. The other 6.2 million \"have no names, have never been identified,\" and exist only as bits and bytes in computer models and fear-mongering reports and news stories, forestry ecologist and Greenpeace cofounder Dr. Patrick Moore observed during recent testimony before the House Water, Oceans and Wildlife Subcommittee.\nOnly 800 or so species have gone extinct in the last five centuries, Dr. Moore added \u2013 and most of them were victims of cats, rats, foxes and other invasive species introduced by European colonizers, or on small islands where native species had no defenses and could not escape.\nAssuming this pattern will be repeated on a global scale, across entire continents, because of climate change, for a mythical 8 million species... and plugging those assumptions into computer programs... isn't science. It's garbage \u2013 designed and intended to justify eliminating the fossil fuels that provide over 80% of the energy that the United States and world use to produce food, jobs, health and prosperity.\nWe're also supposed to swallow pseudo-scientific claims that \"surging levels\" of plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide are creating dangerous hybrid puffer fish, making salmon unable to detect danger, making sharks right-handed and unable to hunt, making Arctic plants \"too tall,\" making coffee growing impossible in many countries, causing pigs to get skinnier, turning Earth into a super-heated Venus, causing the demise of tropical birds, and many other fearsome stories of White Walkers and Days after Tomorrow.\nSadly, all too many people soak up this nonsense like sponges. (Unkind comedians might suggest they have the brain cells of a sponge.) But to have these tales... and the voters and politicians who believe and propagate them... drive our energy and economic policies would be the cruelest joke of all.\nPlace blame for recent tornadoes where It belongs\nTragically, there is nothing unique about the number or severity of more than 55 devastating tornadoes that tore through the outskirts of Kansas City, swept through Indiana and Ohio, and stretched eastward from Idaho and Colorado across eight states late last month.\nNor, unfortunately, is there anything unique regarding all-too-alluring temptations for some politicos to blame such events on \"climate change,\" a term that has come to replace \"global warming\" in name only.\nFlash back to Al Gore lamenting during a June 2013 Rhode Island energy and environment conference following a destructive Moore, Oklahoma twister that scientists \"won't let us yet\" link tornadoes to climate change. Gore claimed that shoddy historical statistics resulted in failures to connect \"these record-breaking tornadoes and the climate crisis.\"\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wasted no time attributing this latest raft of tornadoes to climate change after a hazard warning was issued for Washington, D.C. The New York Democrat immediately released an Instagram video. \"The climate crisis is real y'all,\" she said. \"Guess we're at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country?\"\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez added, \"Other regions deal with wildfires, tornadoes, droughts, etc. But ALL of these threats will be increasing in intensity as climate crisis grows and we fail to act appropriately.\"\nDemocratic 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blamed climate change for two tornadoes that hit"}
{"text":" eastern Alabama. Sanders posted a May 28 statement on his Senate Facebook account. Sanders wrote:\n\"This is insane: As Oklahoma and Arkansas face catastrophic flooding, and Ohio and Indiana reel from tornados, Trump is trying to undermine the very science that proves climate change is real. We need policy based on facts, not rightwing ideology.\"\nSo okay. Let's review some real scientific facts.\nFor starters, the 2019 tornado season wasn't a result of unusually warm spring temperatures, but rather, just the opposite conditions.\nAs explained by meteorologist Dr. Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama, tornado conditions exist only when cool and warm air masses collide. Writing in Fox News, he notes that the perfect conditions for this existed this year after winter has refused to lose its grip on the western United States.\nMay temperatures across the nation were close to 2 degrees Fahrenheit below normal. In addition, atypical snow conditions extended from Northern Michigan through Colorado to the Sierra of California into late May. Together, these circumstances produced a persistently lingering cold air mass.\nTornadoes occur when severe thunderstorms known as supercells create spiraling updrafts causing strong wind shear at the boundaries between colliding warm and cold air masses. The warm air rotates upwards at increasing speeds until it punches through the colder air layer.\nHowever, thunderstorms rarely produce tornadoes, and lacking cold air protagonists, they are virtually unknown altogether in hot and humid tropical regions.\nEvery year, springtime thunderstorms in Central and Southeast U.S. have plenty of warm, moist air to draw on from the Gulf of Mexico. This year, a large field of cold air hung around longer than usual.\nRoy Spencer notes that a very slow U.S. warming trend in recent decades has been accompanied by fewer of these cold springtime air masses over the West. According to National Weather Service statistics, the long-term trend of strong (EF3) to violent (EF5) tornadoes has been decidedly downward, with 2018 experiencing record low activity.\nThis year's spike in tornadoes is made far more dramatic in comparison with 2018 which was the first year recorded without a single violent tornado since record-keeping first began during the late 1800s.\nLast year also experienced near-lows in terms of overall tornado damage.\nThe only better ones were 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nAlthough NOAA reported a slow decline in tornado frequencies between 1954 and 2012, the actual annual numbers \u2014 those of weaker ones in particular \u2014 are uncertain prior to the advent of radar-detection technology.\nNevertheless, Patrick Marsh, a Storm Prediction Center meteorologist, reported that outbreaks of 50 or more tornadoes really aren't uncommon, having happened 63 times in U.S. history. There are even three instances of more than 100 twisters in single years.\nRoy Spencer reminds us once again not to conflate three decade or- longer climate cycles with seasonal weather which naturally varies from year to year. He writes, \"The alarmist claims of AOC, Gore, and Sanders are not just speculative; they are opposed by our observations and by meteorological theory.\"\nAs for that all too ever popular Trump-blaming mantra, perhaps he instead deserves some credit for making America's very recent climate great again. According to the U.S. Natural Hazard statistics, last year also witnessed a below 30-year average in deaths caused not only by tornadoes, but also from hurricanes, flooding and summer overheating.\nOn the other hand, don't count on the president getting cut any cool-headed climate slack either way. Staunch critics will probably still complain that the U.S. experienced a rise in deaths due to extra cold and long winter weather.\nClimate security confusion abounds\nThe news media has been reporting what looks like a conflict within the Trump Administration, over the national security implications of climate change. Supposedly the conflict is between military and intelligence reports describing serious security implications and the Administrations position that climate change is not a serious threat.\nThere may in fact be no conflict. Here is how I see it. Hypothetical security vulnerability is the big confusion!\nThe military has a practice called \"vulnerability analysis\" in which a facility, region or system is assessed via a hypothetical thought experiment. The hypothesis can be extreme and often is. I have done a few that were completely unrealistic, but these analyses can still be useful.\nThese climate alarmist military and intelligence reports are just this sort of vulnerability analysis. They are all of this logical form:\n\"Suppose an extreme case of climate change happens, what adverse security effects might it cause?\"\nApproached in this way it is no surprise that many facilities, regions and systems are classified as vulnerable to some form of hypothetical extreme climate change or other (there being so many).\nThere are certainly regions that would be hard hit by extreme droughts, naval bases unprepared for fantastic sea level rise, airfields that would be damaged by catastrophic floods, etc. in the"}
{"text":" endless list of hypothetical extreme climate change impacts it might be hard to find one that had no security implications.\nThe point is that these hypothetical vulnerability analyses are in no sense realistic threat assessments. Not if these myriad extreme climate changes are not going to occur, and there is no reason to think that they will.\nThis is the Trump Administration's position. Actionable national security threat assessments are based on what is actually happening or very likely to happen. They are never based on speculation, worst case scenarios, etc.\nThat these are not threat assessments calling for actual action needs to be made clear. As extreme hypothesis vulnerability analyses they might be okay.\nThe difference between a real threat assessment and a hypothetical vulnerability assessment is a huge confusion. (Confusion is my field.)\nNote that we have pretty much the same deep confusion with the National Climate Assessment. The authors were specifically instructed to look at worst case scenarios, which are not a basis for action. Unfortunately these hypothetical scenarios were reported as real predictions, in part because some people actually believe them.\nIn the case of the IPCC's October 2018 report that has generated the \"climate crisis\" or \"climate emergency\" scare, the confusion is different. The Paris Accord has targets that range from 2 degrees C of warming down to 1.5 degrees. The IPCC was tasked with saying what that difference looked like as far as the computer models were concerned.\nPredictably the IPCC reported that there would be more damage with 2 degrees than with 1.5 degrees. But the differences were relatively small, certainly not catastrophic, which is why 2 degrees is still the target. They also said that hitting the 1.5 degree target would be very difficult.\nIn the \"climate crisis\" scare these small differences have morphed into 1.5 degrees of warming being the threshold to catastrophe. There is no basis for this whatever in the IPCC report, but the political stampede is on, led by the Green New Deal.\nIn short, climate change policy is a sea of confusion, especially with regard to national security.\nSaving elk with coal mine reclamation\nContrary to what radical environmentalists would have you believe, rural property owners care deeply about the environment.\nThey've lived on their property oftentimes for generations. They see more wildlife in a year than many city dwellers may see in an entire lifetime.\nThus it's sad to see when leftists, the vast majority urbanites, impugn their character as being callous toward the environment.\nIn episode 2 of CFACT's \"Conservation Nation\" YouTube series, host Gabriella Hoffman interviews Leon Boyd and his volunteers who have been working to make reclaimed coal fields in Virginia suitable habitat for growing numbers of elk.\nPrivate landowners have leased land to create habitat, while local volunteers and visitors from far and wide come to lend a helping hand with their efforts. Even the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy has pitched in, allowing for these formerly-mined lands to be used for conservation purposes.\nThe program has been so successful that from 2014 to 2019, the elk herd has actually grown from 71 elk to now around 200. A stunning free-market success story, thanks to Leon's and his volunteers' work with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.\nIn the video, Leon Boyd explains how the region has been working hard to recover from Obama's disastrous \"war on coal\" \u2013 an ill-conceived political effort that hammered many hard working folks.\nNotes Leon, \"Southwest Virginia has thrived on coal for so many years and depended on coal, and with the last few years with the coal and the gas industry being on a downturn and a lot of jobs lost from our area and people leaving, by having the elk and the deer in places that we're trying to put together, we see a lot folks travel here now to spend the weekend and either ride the trails or birdwatch or just wildlife enthusiasts out here seeing whatever may be on the properties.\"\nThe mantra of the green agenda for America's forests and wilderness is \"don't touch!\" But history tells us that environmental solutions are best fostered when humans are empowered with market incentives and strong protections of their property rights \u2014 not when they are prohibited from having any interaction with the natural world whatsoever.\nSkeptical Australian Radio commentator slammed over climate change remarks on TV science panel\nThat weed Karoly has been a Warmist from wayback. He is far from an unbiased scientist. Note that all he points to is raised levels of CO2. But nobody disputes that. What about the global temperature? Is that rising? Crickets. (It's falling). Typical Greenie deviousness\nHis argument that Australia is contributing more than its \"fair share\" of global warming is also faulty. What he is referring to is again CO2 emissions. And skeptics see CO2 as being primarily plant food -- which it undoubtedly is -- and not as any significant influence on global temperature. There have been long periods when CO2 has shot up while temperatuers"}

Karoly has his head in an unmentionable place\nAlan Jones copped an absolute roasting on tonight's episode of Q&A \u2014 despite not even being on the panel.\nThe radio shock jock was slammed by a panel of science experts for downplaying human impact on climate change, after he said we only contribute three per cent to greenhouse gas emissions during his own Q&A appearance last month.\n\"I saw the radio commentator Alan Jones on TV recently, and he said that 0.04 per cent of the world's atmosphere is CO2,\" the questioner said. \"'Three per cent of that human beings create around the world, and of that, 1.3 per cent is created by Australians'. Is that correct, and if so, is human activity really making a difference?\"\nProfessor David Karoly, an Australian atmospheric scientist based at CSIRO, bluntly responded: \"Not everything Jones says is factually accurate.\"\nProf Karoly said that, while it's correct that 0.04 per cent of the world's atmosphere is carbon dioxide, Jones' statistics around humans causing climate change \u2014 and the role Australians specifically play \u2014 is completely false.\n\"I am a climate scientist, and Alan Jones is wrong. The reason he's wrong is because we know that yes, the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is 400 parts per million \u2026 and that corresponds to about 0.04 per cent.\n\"All his other numbers were wrong. We know that carbon dioxide concentration 100 years ago was about 280 parts per million, or 0.028 per cent, but it's grown 120 parts per million \u2014 or about 40 per cent \u2014 and that 40 per cent increase is due to human activity. We know that for absolute certain.\" [Real scientists never know anything for absolute certain]\nIn other words, Prof Karoly was saying we've technically increased greenhouse gases by 40 per cent, not the three per cent figure Jones used.\nThe scientist also slammed the radio host for implying that Australians contribute a negligible amount to global warming.\n\"Australians have contributed about 1.5 per cent. Now that sounds like a small amount, but Australia only makes up 0.3 per cent of the population, and we're contributing 1.5 per cent roughly of greenhouse gases,\" said Prof Karoly. \"So is it fair that 0.3 per cent of the global population has contributed 1.5 per cent? We've contributed much more than our fair share.\"\nParticle physicist Brian Cox said people think the climate is overly \"simple\", which is a big part of the problem. \"But actually, the climate is extremely complicated. These models are very, very complicated and constantly evolving.\n\"I think many people assume you can just work out what the climate's going to do, like it's common sense. But it's actually a very complex system.\" [Too complex to support any firm prediction, in fact]\nFor more postings from me, see DISSECTING LEFTISM, TONGUE-TIED, EDUCATION WATCH INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WATCH, FOOD & HEALTH SKEPTIC and AUSTRALIAN POLITICS.

{"text":"Global Risks 2014 is an analysis of a survey of over 700 world leaders and top businessmen from the World Economic Forum's global multi-stakeholder community. From the report, growing \"global risks\" arise from demographic trends, societal issues, technological developments, environmental concerns, and economic mismanagement.\nEnvironmental concerns include \"water crises, extreme weather events, natural catastrophes, man-made environmental catastrophes and climate change.\" Says the report, climate change in particular is both \"a key economic risk in itself and a multiplier of other risks.\" In its 5th Assessment (released in late 2013), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states \"that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.\" The Global Risks 2014 report notes, \"The increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as storm surges and droughts, is consistent with the latest IPCC modelling. The damage to economic assets, such as city and industrial infrastructure, agriculture and key global supply chains, caused by such extreme weather events is becoming more evident, as is the fragility of the global logistics and mobility systems.\" Well, super typhoon Yolanda demonstrated this quite emphatically.\nActually, it has to be questioned whether the economists who run national economies really possess the ability to craft the right economic policies. What can be observed is that most of the economists who formulate national economic policies seem firmly bound to conventional economic thinking and, consequently, restricted to inside-the-box prescriptions. For example, none seem able to abandon the cherished Keynesian belief that more spending (and more consumption) is always better than less or prepared to scuttle the long-held policy goal of striving for the greatest possible increases in GDP growth rates.\nIn any case, taking its theme as \"The Reshaping of the World,\" the World Economic Forum's just-concluded annual meeting at Davos sought \"to develop the insights, initiatives and actions necessary to respond to current and emerging challenges.\" Obviously, there was explicit recognition that \"profound political, social and, above all, technological forces are transforming our lives, communities and institutions.\" Beyond that recognition, however, little else, in terms of concrete solutions, programs, and agreements, was accomplished at the conference.\nAnd so how about our country? How will we deal with these growing global risks? These, note, are interconnected, interdependent, and, hence, complex. Not being blessed with competent and \"strategically driven\" leadership, maybe all we can really do is pray to whatever gods are out there."}

Our Research Beacons podcast series highlights how researchers at The University of Manchester are finding solutions to global challenges across five key areas: Advanced Materials, Cancer, Energy, Global Inequalities and Industrial Biotechnology, our key research beacons.\nIn our 'Spotlights On' energy podcast we'll be shining a light on energy research at Manchester and the global challenge of keeping the lights on. Over the next three episodes we will be joined by experts from across the University to hear how their work is helping to keep electricity flowing or trying to curb climate emissions and minimise the impacts of climate change.\nThere's been a transition away from coal-fired power in the UK over the last five years, following a drive to slash carbon emissions. Our energy remains dominated by North Sea oil and gas, but as we move to a low-carbon economy and with access to energy supply being used by some countries as a political tool, we've been increasing generating capacity from renewable sources. Indeed, on some days, for instance, when it's been particularly blowy, we've seen stretches of time where we've not needed any coal from the grid at all, something not seen since before the Industrial Revolution.\nNuclear power also currently provides twenty percent of our generating capacity, but our old reactors are nearing the end of their operating lives. To avoid energy shortfalls, our focus needs to be on investment in supplies that are secure, diverse, affordable and low carbon, such as renewable generation, nuclear power, coal fire generation with carbon capture and storage, pipelines to import gas from Norway and Continental Europe and terminals for imported liquid natural gas, and further gas storage.\nThis needs to be coupled with infrastructure improvements including major new electricity lines and a smart grid and energy efficiency programs. We will be investigating some of these areas in this podcast mini-series.\nToday, we're looking at nuclear and bioenergy as clean sources of energy generation. I'm pleased to welcome Professor Abbie Jones and Dr. Andrew Welfle to discuss their research and what it means for the future supply of energy.\n<Vicky> So Abbie, over to you. Why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do?\n<Abbie> Hello Vicky, I'm a professor in nuclear graphite engineering and I'm based within the School of Engineering, here at The University of Manchester. My research group is principally focused around nuclear graphite, which is contained within the core of an AGR - advanced gas-cooled reactor and what we principally do, is look at the safety and aging aspects of the nuclear graphite materials and try to predict its behaviour. To better understand safety and to better provide confidence to the office of nuclear regulation. So, within the School of Engineering we have a unique set of a graphite laboratories, so that we can work on real radioactive samples. Half the group equally are computationally very heavy. So, they build large models and try to computationally examine the behaviour of the real reactors and then we get to go into the Laboratories and test that on real samples.\n<Vicky> Fantastic, that's grand. How did you get interested in this specific area of research?\n<Abbie> Well, I've always been interested in energy and safety really. I did my PhD around carbon science, around the diamond community actually and then I went from diamond, which is a very nice, well-ordered state of carbon, to a very disordered graphite material and started working in the nuclear graphite sector and then I realised, that a lot of my research skills were directly applicable and that I could really throw"}
{"text":" my heart and soul into it.\n<Vicky> Were you motivated to make that move by anything you might have seen in the news? Or was there something that kind of made an impact on you personally? How did you go from the sparkly world of diamonds to the more interesting world of nuclear?\n<Abbie> (Laughter) Well. It's really around electricity and electrical safety and trying to do research, that has a real-life impact and has got real application. So, I wanted to get more involved in something that wasn't so fundamentally science, and that could be just as applicable in the modern world.\n<Vicky> Great. I will go a little bit more into, kind of how that research has been applied in a moment. Andrew if you could answer the same questions. If you could tell us who you are and what you do, that would be great?\n<Andrew> Thank you. I'm Andrew Welfle and I'm a research fellow at The University of Manchester and I'm based in a group called the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. My work very much revolves around bioenergy. So that's working in anything to do with bioenergy. That being a renewable energy technology. So basically, how can that technology be used more so in the future, to meet our climate change commitments and to generate renewable energy and to stimulate sustainable development. So, basically, the work I do is everything.\n<Vicky> Very important and you mentioned the Tyndall Centre and the climate change research where you work. Is there anything you want to tell us about specifically your area?\n<Andrew> It's a really interesting place to work, the Tyndall Centre. So basically, we are sitting in the School of Engineering, but in our department the Tyndall Centre, there's not many Engineers. We're quite unique, in that we have people who are engineers or physicists to social scientists, geographers and we all kind of work with a fellow mission, to work on climate change research. So, we kind of accompany and work alongside engineers to basically develop the solutions for energy and sustainability, so it's quite a unique place to work.\n<Vicky> A great example of lots of different disciplines coming together towards a common goal for a greater good. Then what interested you in your area of research?\n<Andrew> I went on a bit of a journey. I started off many years ago and did a geography undergraduate degree. I was very much interested in the earth, environment, land systems - environment essentially - and I got interested in climate change and sustainability through that. Then my first few jobs were with engineering companies. So I went on a bit of a journey towards the engineering world and when it came to deciding what I want to do for a PhD, bioenergy kind of sits between those, so I kind of felt at home. It was very much bioenergy, analysing natural systems lands, forests or whatever it maybe and it's also got that engineering slant, as in the technologies to create the energy at the end.\n<Vicky> Fantastic. Was there anything that kind of inspired you, kind of in the greater world, to go into this, like in the news or anything personally that made you think?\n<Andrew> Well, obviously, looming over us all in media is climate change, it's there all the time. So, I work heavily in that field. But renewable energy is something that interests me, and I just see the work I do with bioenergy as such a flexible and unique technology. You can take any organic material basically and produced energy from it, using all sorts of fancy chemical engineering processes. So, it's a quite interesting.\n<Vicky> Fascinating and there's lots of different people working in lots of different areas and obviously you're linked in with that. Which is great. So, we've talked about two different aspects of energy generation for the UK and the world. I guess here in the UK we don't really think about electricity that much. We tend to take it for granted. The fact that it's kind of on tap, there's constant supply there. Should we be worried that a constant reliable energy supply might not always be the case?\n<Abbie> Yes absolutely. Well from my perspective definitely so. We're at a point with the nuclear reactors within the UK, that are providing 20% of our electricity, are really coming towards their end of their life and over the next 10 years, will progressively see that decline from 20% down to zero and we'll just end up with more and more reliance on gas. Which is not the way we want to be going.\n<Andrew> I think we've been really spoilt in this country, as in fossil fuels provide such an amazing technology; so flexible, its energy is there when you need it. There's lots of energy there, but the problem is the emissions and climate change. We need to ween our"}
{"text":" self, off those fossil fuels. So, we have been a bit spoilt, in terms of those energies always being there. The challenge and interest in our research field is very much, 'how can we meet that challenge of renewable technologies and bring a mix of technologies, and balance those demands with the different technologies?', that I think can tackle fossil fuels.\n<Vicky> Do you think the general public have a perception that energy is constantly on tap? Do you think they're worried or complacent?\n<Andrew> I think in this country, like many countries in Europe, for example, we don't have the same perception as maybe other parts of the world. Energy is always there; we don't have many power cuts. Previously we haven't really thought about where the energy comes from. I think that's changing slightly because of the news agenda. People are starting to think about coal, natural gas and shale gas has been quite prominent. So yeah, it's something that people are starting to think about.\n<Vicky> How, is your research very specifically addressing this challenge of keeping our lights on?\n<Abbie> Well, we're addressing the problem of continued safe operation. I mentioned earlier that our reactors are aging and so we need as many combined heads as possible. So that we can understand its behaviour going forward and we've got the safest and most reliable supply and confidence in nuclear technology.\n<Vicky> So, I guess we need to plug that gap as you say, for the reactors that are going to be decommissioned. Nothing is replacing that 20%, unless we rely on fossil fuels. So, it's how can we make them last?\n<Abbie> Making them last as long as possible and plug that gap to be able to get new low-carbon technologies for the future, with renewables, by investing in next generation nuclear reactors. So that we've got something to give us a constant supply and be hand-in-hand with renewables and with other low carbon suppliers out there. That can really give us a safe and secure supply to the UK.\n<Vicky> Great. That kind of leads into your renewable research and how that's being addressed?\n<Andrew> Yeah so we basically do lots of work with policymakers, because the looming target at the minute, is that the UK's decided to go carbon neutral by 2050 and that's harder than you think it's going to be. So, lots of policy makers are running around like headless chickens at the moment. Behind the scenes working at how to get there. They're talking to a lot of academics and people such as the group I'm involved with, to work out how my technology or other peoples can try and fill that gap. So, working in bioenergy is quite interesting because it can provide heat, it can provide power, transport fuels. It's quite a flexible option and we're working at how bioenergy can contribute the most to each of those.\n<Vicky> What's your food source, what's the food stock for your specific area of bioenergy.\n<Andrew> My research particularly focuses on resource. So how much resource do we have? What and where is it? How do we mobilise it? How do we make the most of it? So that's everything from the stuff you put in the bin after having food. Restaurants and any industry that produces waste which is organic; that's a resource. There's also the stuff that people commonly associate with bioenergy forests, wood pellets, wood chips. Hopefully, that's sustainable. You have agriculture straws animal waste basically anything organic is a potential feedstock for bioenergy process. So, my job is very much looking at what's available, how best to use it and what kind of energy can we generate from it?\n<Vicky> So, you're kind of tackling two challenges, because you're helping with the waste issue, which is another big area in sustainability and the circular economy.\n<Andrew> Yes, lots of lots of work we do is around waste. How can we develop waste management strategies? Where bio energy can be generated from our waste? And at the same time mitigating emissions that maybe generated from waste that goes on to landfill. Likewise, how can bioenergy be linked to the agricultural sector and use resources that may otherwise decay or rot in the fields and produce methane. So basically, bioenergy can kind of accompany work along with other sectors, to provide energy and to also reduce emissions along the way.\n<Vicky> Fantastic stuff. Your research obviously has massive benefit for the society. Is there anything you both might want to add about the kind of impact and benefit this research has specifically had?\n<Abbie> Well, I think we're both hand-in-hand in trying to reduce carbon content and then CO2 emissions from a nuclear perspective. Just helping to keep the lights on without nuclear reactors has helped to save forty-two million tons of CO2 over the last five"}
{"text":" years, just from continued operation of the AGR's \u2013 Advanced Gas Cooled reactors.\n<Vicky> Wow. An impressive figure.\n<Andrew> Likewise, we work with policymakers themselves, but we also work with organizations that try and push policymakers, for example. We recently worked with the Committee for Climate Change. So, we work on reports which are basically sent to government to advise them how the UK could grow its bioeconomy. So, we were kind of advising and saying why aren't we doing this, why aren't we doing that. Our research in Manchester shows that essentially if the UK did push the boat out, we could generate vast quantities of energy at home from our biomass resources, if we so wanted to. So, a lot of our work is poking politicians and policymakers to make the decisions to up their game when on renewables.\n<Vicky> I guess also within both of these industries, there are jobs created as well?\n<Abbie> Yes, well typically the nuclear sector provides around 10,000 jobs across the UK. Around two thousand jobs per station and a further two to 300 jobs in the local community. So, it's very beneficial.\n<Vicky> There's an economic, societal, environmental impact of the important work that you're both involved in?\n<Andrew> Yeah, I think it's important that academics and specialist in our area talk to politicians in the language they want to hear. They want to know about jobs. So, if we talk about for example the recent election that took place, lots of talk was about our forestation and planting trees. That's a big opportunity for bioenergy based on sustainability, but also that's going to make lots of jobs. So, if we can talk in the language of the politicians, there is no reason why we can't meet everyone's gains.\n<Vicky> So, what's the legacy of your research and is there anything that we can do now, that we didn't know about before the research took place? What can we look to do in the future?\n<Abbie> So, our modelling capability that we've developed at Manchester, really has helped us understand the radiation behaviour of the current nuclear reactors to a much longer lifetime than we ever thought we could. Going forward, we can really help to address some of the fundamental kind of areas that are lacking in knowledge for next generation reactors, because we've developed a good understanding of our current stations.\n<Andrew> Likewise, if you probably don't know at home, bioenergy is the number one renewable energy source in the UK in terms of generation from renewables. Much of that is currently power, so a lot of our work has been involved around 'where is the resource coming from to power these power stations?' So, we've done lots of stuff around sustainability and that has filtered through into policy and legislation. That has required that resources, particularly importantly from elsewhere, meet certain sustainability standards. So that's a strong legacy, that hopefully we've built on but as you move away from power and other technologies such as PV or wind turbines take over, there's opportunities for bio energies and heat and transport fuels particularly. So hopefully we'll continue that legacy and make renewable sustainable energy.\n<Vicky> What, challenges, still remain? What's next? What do you want to tackle in five years going forward?\n<Abbie> How, can we make systems more efficient? So, we can generate process heat and we've always got this constant supply, whichever technology it is. We want to get to a really efficient system where we're not having any waste lost. And that we can then start to use batteries when they come online to store the heat, until that we've got a supply of electricity going forward.\n<Andrew> Going back again, about climate change. The net zero target is going to be the main thing that everyone's going to be working on in the sector, to a certain extent in the next few years. We're very good in this country of creating pathways or trajectory of how to get there. So, a lot of much of our work will hopefully be focusing on getting these ideas off the ground. These calculations off our papers into reality.\n<Vicky> Yeah, I think it's, great the work that the Tyndall Centre have done setting the carbon trajectories for city regions and Greater Manchester.\n<Andrew> Yeah, so we're very good at telling people how to get there. The hard bit is them getting there, them implementing the plan. So, I think much of the future work will be focused on that.\n<Vicky> So hopefully when we've got our a crystal ball or we kind of time travel into the future and look back, we can see all these great things that have that have been achieved, fingers crossed, and I guess instrumental to enabling what our policy makers and politicians are doing today to enable a better future. So, if you had 10 minutes with one of"}
{"text":" our current cabinet ministers involved in one of these areas; what sort of things would you be telling them? What would your asks be in relation to this topic?\n<Abbie> Well I would ask them why aren't we now investing in low-carbon and very safe reliable nuclear systems, hand in hand with renewables that will last us 60 to 70 years into the future? Why are we really not putting that investment into the next generation reactors and why are we just lagging behind and relying on gas?\n<Andrew> Likewise, I mentioned much my work revolves around identifying opportunities from different resources that we could produce energy from. Which we're not doing currently and that includes identifying land on which we could grow crops for various types of energy. Going forward I'd say to a politician, we have a unique opportunity whether you like it or not from leaving the EU. The common agricultural policy, we can reform that, why not reform it in a way that benefits things such as energy in addition to food.\n<Abby> Leads to security in the UK.\n<Andrew> Yeah definitely.\n<Vicky> Absolutely. Solves the energy trilemma and the current challenge. Fantastic. Well it's been a pleasure to chat to you both and find out more information. We'll also be able to post some links to the relevant research and papers that you're both involved in, if people are interested in finding out more about these interesting areas and very important research.\nListen to our next energy podcast to find out more about how the grid is burning up to growth and demand at dramatically different mix of sources of generation from when it was put in place over six decades ago and whether it can cope with increasing extreme weather events.

We've been joined by experts from across the University to hear how their work is helping to keep electricity flowing and keep the lights on. Infrastructure improvements are necessary to avoid energy shortfalls, including major new electricity lines, a smart grid, and work to enhance the resilience around the energy network is vital. Today I'm joined by Dr Vidyadhar Peesapati, Dr Mathaios Panteli and PhD student Matt Nobel.\n<Vicky> So, over to you Viddy. Why don't you tell us a bit about who you are and what you do?\n<Viddy> I'm a research fellow in high-voltage engineering and my area is conditioning monitoring and asset health. So, what I tend to do is try to understand the health of equipment, the high voltage equipment that's on the network. Which is predominantly an aging network. So, we try to find faults that happen and try and see if we can predict failures before they happen. I work in in UK's largest high voltage lab of any academic institution. We can reach voltages that are capable of testing the equipment connected on the UK's network. The UK's largest transmission voltage at the moment is 400 KV AC. Our equipment can go to twice that and we can also do it impulse testing i.e. lightning testing on equipment. We try and try and replicate things that could happen on a real network and that's basically what I do. I test equipment sometimes to failure, to understand if we can pick up little diagnostics, to see what happens to equipment before they actually go bang.\n<Vicky> So, I think you've probably made a lot of people very jealous by working in such a fantastic laboratory"}
{"text":", being able to generate lightning strikes and the works. What actually got you involved in this area of research in the first place?\n<Viddy> I came to the University to do a masters in Power Systems and at that time, this was 15 or 16 years ago, there was a massive shift in what was going to happen in terms of the renewables being connected to the network. So, not only was it a very interesting area, but it's very attractive area from an employment perspective. So, I got interested in high-voltage engineering. I did a PhD on lightning, which meant I did a lot of hands-on testing and using the equipment in the high voltage lab and slowly that shift is where I started enjoying testing equipment. Testing equipment to failure, understanding why things failed. Almost like an MOT or a blood test. We try and pick up signatures on equipment, to make sure or to understand what's happening to it, especially as it's an aging network.\nI've been in the area for a good 15 years now and I genuinely enjoy it. Especially when you get to use some cool equipment that not a lot of other universities have in the world. So, it's a great place to be at the moment.\n<Vicky> Fantastic. Sounds really exciting. Over to Mathaios. Tell us a bit about who you are and what you're involved in.\n<Mathaios> Thank you so much Vicky. So, I'm a lecturer in resilient low-carbon energy systems in the power generation division here at The University of Manchester. So, my main research area is looking at how we can make the transition to low carbon energy systems, while maintaining high levels of quality electricity supplies to the customers. The energy landscape is currently going through a lot of changes; drastic changes as you said Vicky. We have the penetration of emerging technologies, such as battery energy systems, PV, intermittent renewable sources, which bring many benefits to the decarbonisation of the energy systems, as well as many challenges. So, my research focuses on developing advanced mathematical tools to see how I can optimise the operation and the planning of an energy system, to actually accommodate and facilitate the benefits of these low-carbon technologies.\nA power outage in the electricity infrastructure can have cascading effects on other infrastructure, for example communication, transportation and so on. So, in my research, I'm also looking at how to evaluate these interdependencies between critical infrastructures and how to build a resilient infrastructure in the UK, against extreme events and catastrophic impacts. We're doing work both in the UK, looking at the resilience of the UK electricity grid, as well as internationally. So, we are leading international projects at The University of Manchester, under the global challenges research fund. And we're looking at solving global challenges faced mainly from the global South where we're looking at the electrification challenges in developing countries, for example, how to build in resilience and sustainability, and for countries that are currently developing and are exposed to extreme weather events. So, our research goes far beyond just UK and to the need to tackle global challenges as well.\n<Vicky> Great stuff and then finally over to you Matt. Do you want to tell us a little bit about what you're up to at the moment?\n<Matt> Yeah, thank you. So, I'm a final year PhD student at the power systems research group here in Manchester and I look at the resilience of power networks. That means how to keep the lights on during extreme events and severe weather conditions. My particular research interest is, that while it's fairly straightforward to avoid these black outs by just building more and more transmission lines and building more and more generation capacity, it's also a very expensive way of doing it. So, I look more at methods that exploit or use the skills and features modern systems already have, in order to avoid these blackouts from happening.\n<Vicky> Great and then what got you interested in all of this?\n<Matt> So I think keeping the lights on, is actually one of the main challenges of electricity supplier at moment and we are actually quite dependent on electricity, because everything we use, everything we do somehow depends on electricity. We use communications, we use public transport, and some people heat their homes with electricity. So every single aspect depends on electricity, And while we have to make sure the lights stay on, we also have to make sure everything is affordable and sustainable and I think this is a very interesting and challenging task and it's very fascinating to look at.\n<Vicky> So it's great that we've got our researchers on the case looking at all these issues. So here in the UK we do tend to take for granted, that when we switch on that light switch and we want to watch something on Netflix, it's always going to be there and available. You mentioned that it's an area that's a bit of a challenge. How worried should we be about our electricity supply? Should"}
{"text":" we be? Do you think the general public are quite complacent about it?\n<Viddy> I think there is a significant shift in how we use electricity and how we generate electricity as well. I don't want to use the word worry, but I think the change is happening at a very alarming rate. That change - how we generate, how we use, how we distribute and how we transmit energy - is going to may have a big impact and how we actually use it. So, if everyone has an electric car that will change the demand. That will also have an impact on supply. That actually will have an impact on the equipment that's in the network. So, all of these things need to be looked at. One event happening can have a cascading effect on the network and with our over-reliance on electricity, anything of that sort, can actually have a huge impact on our day-to-day life. So yeah it is something that has to be thought about and looked at.\n<Mathaios> I totally agree. I would not I say we should be worried as the National Grid is doing fantastic job, in keeping the reliability of the Grid at 99.9999%, but there's still that 0.0001% of events that we should worry about and this area of research is what we now call 'High impact - Low probability' events. As I said before, the August 2019 blackout was a once-every-30-years event. So there are a lot of changes going on in the energy landscape which we don't fully understand yet and we still need to better model, better understand their impacts and the challenges that they can impose on the electricity grid. As well as the exposure of the power grid to more and more frequent extreme weather events that challenge the traditional way that the system has been designed and operated for many decades now. So, I will not say we should worry, but what I would like to say is that we should rethink a bit about the way that we are designing, planning and operating the power system. In order to be resilient and flexible enough to accommodate the emerging technologies and all the challenges that come with these technology and technologies in the future.\n<Vicky> So, it's a lot of planning ahead that's involved here and looking at what's on the horizon and acting accordingly.\n<Mathaios> Yes exactly.\n<Vicky> Can you tell how your research has actually benefited us in the UK, or in a country across the globe? Are there any sort of specific examples you can tell us about?\n<Viddy> Yes so basically at The University of Manchester, we're leading a number of international projects with partners from around the world. I would say the highlight of our research so far has been winning the 2018 Newton prize. Which is basically an annual prize awarded from the British government to projects that demonstrated excellence in impact, innovation and research. That related to a joint project with Chile, where we're aiming to design their electricity grid to be robust and resilient against earthquakes. We're very happy that our planning and optimisation tool, that we developed, has actually been adopted from the electricity coordinator in Chile. Which led so far to over 50 million U.S. dollars of investments in the Chilean grid. Which also led to another project to broaden the impact of our mathematical tools to other countries in Latin America to hopefully make those countries more resilient and sustainable.\n<Vicky> Fantastic. Are there any examples in the UK as well, of the work you've been doing here at The University of Manchester that will have an impact for the UK?\n<Viddy> Laughter - Yes absolutely. We successfully completed a project a couple of years ago called Resilience Electricity Networks for Great Britain. Which was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council here in the UK, where they were looking at the impact of climate change and extreme weather event and the risk resilience of transmission networks. So basically, we had a very nice partnership with the Tyndall Centre here in Manchester, where we're getting different and future climate scenarios, future demand scenarios and generation scenarios for the UK. Then we're using those scenarios to basically assess the future resilience of the grid against the many challenges you mentioned the beginning - that basically we will experience different changes in generation demand behaviour, exposure to different weather events and so on - to make the electricity infrastructure of the UK more resilient to such events. We also have the opportunity to work closely with social scientists. So, we expanded if you like the core engineering work that were very good at, as engineers, to look more into the social aspects of climate change and the reliance electricity supply into our work as well.\n<Vicky> Fantastic. So, there's a real mix of disciplines coming together to help address this as a challenge, as well, which is great to hear. What do you think are the key challenges on the horizon over the next five years? What's the things we need to really be focused on tackling?\n"}
{"text":"<Mathaios> I think there's a few things actually. I think getting to grips on how we will be using electricity is one of the key agendas, at least from my perspective. For me it's understanding especially the equipment. We work significantly with a lot of the utilities companies for the National Grid, Scottish and Southern energy WPD. We are always checking equipment, testing equipment to understand aging and we're trying to understand the impact of all the changing infrastructure that's going to happen. Especially electric vehicles, distribution generation, wind and the cost of the equipment. I think that's actually quite an important thing, because the shift that we are seeing right now is only going to go ahead within the next 10 next 15 years. We are in a very comfortable state at the moment, where we turn the switch on it and it's an uninterrupted power supply and to expect that to happen for the next 5, 10 or 15 years. When you have such a significant change and I think the talk recently about electric vehicles being the only mode of personal transport in the next 15 years, almost a certain extent taking out petrol and diesel vehicles, will have a significant impact on the infrastructure. So, I think the next five years we'll see how that is going to change our network and what we do on the network to almost, give it that extra strength for instance. So quite exciting times going forward.\n<Viddy> We, should not only look at this from the perspective of the industry or the academics, but also from the perspective of society. People tend to not to think about the availability of electricity, but the availability of services. So, it doesn't really matter to them how their home is warmed or how they get transported, as long as the homes are warm, and they get transported. So, from the perspective of resilience, if people still have access to these services, even during a blackout, then the impact of these outages would be less severe.\n<Mathaios> I agree with Viddy. Just to further emphasise the need for flexibility in our electricity grid, looking ahead in the future because we have traditionally designed the system to be robust enough to deal with abnormal conditions, let's say. So, we are doing a very good job when, for example, when losing an element in the system. Keeping it live as well and we made a very good job in keeping the lights on under these expected conditions, but we see more and more events hitting the network that we didn't predict. So, building a bit of flexibility in the system, in order to be able to cope with potentially unforeseen contingencies and events is becoming very very critical in the future.\n<Vicky> What kind of events have been hitting us that we've not seen before? Can you give us some examples?\n<Mathaios> Yeah, the most vivid example is the blackout that happened in the UK in August 2019. Where basically we lost a number of assets in the power grids more or less at the same time. That was a unique experience, as far as I know, in the history of UK.\n<Vidy> There was lightning strike involved in that as well, and it's interesting that's the kind of things that you have to account for. To a certain extent you're planning for abnormal events that you know could happen, if that's the right word to use. So, you're almost trying to predict to a certain extent, these events that could happen again. I like that word that Mathaios was using, high impact but low probability. The sheer fact of the high impact makes us have to think about it and worry about it. Our network is a living thing and that's the thing that people need to understand, it's happening now as we speak. So, changes are immediate the network has been planned with a surplus and that surplus will not be a surplus, as we move towards higher electrification.\n<Mathaios> So we need to really define the surplus.\n<Vidy> Exactly. So where does that come from? Matt actually highlighted that as well. As a community we are used to having that service. That could be heating, turning on your kettle or turning on your TV and then suddenly if you had to make a choice between, what you turn on and when you turn it on. You will start to ask questions. All of these things are things that networks have to think about. To be fair, the distribution networks do think about this. Transmission networks think about it; that's the reason why they're so robust. They were heavily designed to take on these hits, but we are doing more of it and expecting more of it, as well. Which is kind of where we all come in really.\n<Mathaios> Yeah, I mean just to add to what Viddy said about distribution networks. The UK blackout in 2019 is a great example of the impact of the distribution networks, as well, the reliability of the overall electricity grid because we lost generation."}
{"text":"\n<Viddy> There was a huge disruption on the railway network as well. Vicky were you on a train at the time?\n<Vicky> Yeah. I was on a train, trapped on the hottest day of the year in July 2019. Which is a little bit unpleasant, but that was caused by the sagging in the overhead lines and the train just snarled to a halt for three hours.\n<Viddy> That's interesting. There's only a few of us in this room and you don't have to go too far to understand that already there's things that have happened, that have impacted on our day-to-day lives to some extent.\n<Vicky> All external events can affect the knowns, the unknowns and then the black swan event. Matt you mentioned about lessening the impact of the blackouts through actions that we can take, like community resilience and other areas. Are there any examples of countries where that has been done really well? Where it's works effectively?\n<Matt> There are countries which have faced lots of blackouts in the past and the people in these countries help themselves by buying solar backup power generators and storage systems. So, it's not only electricity; it's also knowing where to access these services, if the electricity fails. So, for example, if electricity fails on the large scale, then usually the water supply fails. So, the question is, where do you get water from? So, you need people who know where there are clean springs that you can use for water. So, it's really like, preparing communities. So, the community knows and maybe somebody has a back-up generator in the cellar. Maybe somebody has batteries which other people can use to charge their phones. So, by enabling the community you can reduce many of the impacts of such a blackout.\n<Vicky> I guess that's all down to communications as well as knowledge that you're talking about. Where these services are, might come down to effective communications.\n<Mathaios> It really comes down to the support that is provided from the network operator. To those vulnerable and exposed customers and believe it or not, even in the UK, there are Distribution Network Organisations that categorise customers that are vulnerable. Who are very weakly connected to the main grid. For example, there are areas in the North West and in the Lake District for example and even in North Wales, which are exposed very frequently to disconnection of electricity assets, due to extreme weather events. As Matt said they organise communities to deal with these events. For example, they have backup generators to connect to in case their electricity goes off. And it goes off much more frequently than it does in metropolitan areas of the UK.\n<Vicky> I love the story, I think it was in New York, I can't remember what year. Where people were out in the streets and lighting candles and the fact that they had a blackout actually brought people together. There's a bit of a nice community atmosphere there. So, I guess we need to stock up on a few candles.\n<Viddy> I have an example of that actually in the UK that a friend of mine shared a few years ago. There was a power outage in his area and during Christmas time. I said that must have been horrible and he actually said it was the best Christmas ever because the children's phones ran out of battery. So, they got candles out and they sat together and played different board games. So, they came closer as a family and they had the best Christmas of their life.\n<Vicky> So maybe we need to learn from the past and apply some learnings to the future as well? Finally, I've got a last question for you. If you had 5 minutes with a cabinet minister - I don't know, maybe you're stuck in a lift, because the electricity is gone out and you time to chat there for a while - have you got any key messages about what maybe government can be doing from a policy perspective in these areas? What focus do we need to put on certain things?\n<Viddy> Infrastructure. Change is needed and it needs a huge boost right now. For me, if I had been able to, I'd talk about infrastructure. You kind of think electric vehicles and stuff like that. I don't think we're at a point where we have a network of let's say fast charging points. Where people can just take a car and just go wherever they want for thousands of kilometres. I don't think that exists anywhere. That's one of the key reasons when people talk about infrastructure. I think is quite an interesting thing and I think that would be doing something. I definitely would discuss that with someone in a decision maker position to be honest, yeah.\nI think it's very important to link the different types of infrastructure. So, transport, water, electricity, communication all together and look at them from a whole system perspective. To"}
{"text":" make use of any interconnection and links between them; that's one thing policymakers and regulators, as well, should look at. The other thing is strengthening the communities and preparing them for these kinds of events.\n<Mathaios> From my point of view, I was very pleased to see that OfGem the electricity regulator in UK is considering resilience against unknown events within the next regulatory framework in the UK, to become active in a couple of years' time. So, I'm really looking forward to seeing if there's going to be a change as we have discussed just now in the way that we plan the system we operate the system to be more flexible. To accommodate all these changes that are going on in the energy landscape. So in my opinion we should invent more flexibility, as I said before in the way that we operate the system and it would be nice for this to be captured in the regulatory framework as well in order to enable the development of business case studies basically. The room and the area for all the new technologies to penetrated into the system, in a secure and reliable way.\n<Vicky> Thanks ever so much for your time. You've given us a lot to think about and for external bodies to think about as well as the general public. So, I'll let you get back to the great work that you're doing in there keeping our lights on and electricity flowing.\nListen to our next energy podcast to find out more about keeping the lights on and some practical tips we can all take to help mitigate against climate change and carbon emissions. I'll be talking to Dr. John Broderick about why the term keeping the lights on, is in itself problematic and we were talking about the upcoming COP26 conference in Glasgow and some key themes around the research he's doing on carbon budget setting.\nTo hear more about our research, advanced materials, cancer, energy, global inequalities and industrial biotechnology go to manchester.ac.uk\nAssessing the effect of preventive islanding on power grid resilience\nIdentifying optimal portfolios of resilient network investments against natural hazards, with applications to earthquakes\nPower systems resilience assessment: hardening and smart operational enhancement strategies\nFlexibility in sustainable electricity systems: multivector and multisector nexus perspectives\nBlog: Community resilience \u2013 are we unable to deal with power cuts?\nEpisode three: Achieving net zero\nWhat can we do as citizens to meet our electricity demand against the net zero challenge?

Today we're going to be talking about the term keeping the lights on and what that means for us as citizens and what we can do to really help in striving for the zero carbon targets that we're trying to achieve to mitigate the effects of climate change. So, we'll cover a few issues around that, but firstly John, over to you, if you'd like to tell us who you are and what you do?\n<John> My name is John Broderick and I'm a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, and I do research as part of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.\n<Vicky> Fantastic. Could you tell us a little bit more about the Tyndall Centre and maybe anything that's kind of special about that group or facility?\n<John> I really enjoy working at the Tyndall Centre because it is such a diverse community of researchers. We have got engineers and physical scientists and natural scientists and social scientists as well. So, we have people who work on sociology and social psychology, alongside people working on the fundamental technologies.\n<Vicky> So that's kind of multidisciplinary research coming together for the greater good?\n<John> Well yes, and to analyse the problems that climate change puts up towards us. In Manchester, we focus on the energy system.\n<Vicky> Can you tell us about your area of research and what got you interested in that?\n<John> I'm interested in carbon budgeting. So, I look at the quantities of emissions on aggregate that energy systems and energy technologies produce. I got into this about ten years ago when aviation and offsetting was becoming a hot topic and we were looking at what we could do to reduce the impact of air travel. Now that went quiet for a bit and I did some work on shale gas and on smart grids, but aviation is coming right back around and that's where some current research direction is going.\n<Vicky> What motivated you to get into this? Is it something you saw on the news? Something that"}
{"text":" had an impact on you personally?\n<John> Well the start of this motivation was as a six former I won a science prize. The prize was to go on an ecology field trip in the Bahamas. Which was all very exciting and glamorous but when we got out there the coral reefs that we were meant to be monitoring we're in a pretty bad state. They were suffering from coral bleaching. I don't know if you know but the corals themselves are a symbiosis between a little sea anemone creature that builds the physical skeleton. The carbonate skeleton of the coral reef has little tentacles and captures plankton. But also, within its cells it has some algae that photosynthesise and when the corals are stressed, they eject those algae. The symbiosis breaks down, they go white and they lose their colour because they lose their photosynthetic pigments and then they can ultimately, and frequently, die off.\nThat removes the physical basis of the whole coral reef ecosystem. So, this was many moons ago and we were seeing in that particular year a significant bleaching event and it was striking. I mean visually striking seeing white corals on the reef. So that really made me think about the physical and the biological consequences of climate change.\n<Vicky> Yes, that's a really tangible experience that kind of roots what's happening, what we've contributed to. You can actually see the effects of that. I guess we're seeing more and more of these kinds of effects?\n<John> The coral ecosystems are some of the first that will be most heavily affected by climate change because it's the warming background temperatures that drive this stress that causes the bleaching impact.\n<Vicky> There's examples obviously we can see; ice caps melting, all the way through to the two fires in Australia. It looks like we're getting more and more signals that the planet's not going to cope very well forever with the contribution we are making so carbon emissions.\n<John> Yes and so I decided a few years later that actually I didn't just want to be watching things going downhill. I wanted to be working on analysing the causes of the problems and the solutions to the problems. So that's how I ended up in engineering department.\n<Vicky> Well thank you for all the work you are doing to benefit the world and we'll probably come on to a little bit more about what you do there. Just to link into the theme of the podcast and the previous conversations we've had on parts on and two, we're talking about keeping the lights on, as a theme for our 'Spotlight On' energy and we've covered generation and how we can meet the demand through generation and obviously climate change came up quite heavily in that conversation. Looking at how we can find energy sources that are low carbon emitters, we talked to experts in the field of nuclear energy as a clean fuel and how we can kind of bridge the energy gap with nuclear power and plant life extension of existing reactors to keep the power going. We also talked to Dr. Andrew Welfle, who told us about his work in bioenergy, as a clean source of renewable energy, to help move away from our dependence on fossil fuels.\nWe covered generation issues in part one and then in part two. We talked about the resilience of the network and the work that some of our academics in the Department of Electric and Electronic Engineering are doing about the grid and how we can make the grid more resilient and robust, with the integration of more renewables on the system. We also considered the fact that it's quite an old network, 60 years old, and the extreme weather events that cause effects. We also looked globally as well at places like Chile, and how the electricity network stands up to some Black Swan extreme weather events. So, we covered those areas in terms of how we can keep the lights on, both from meeting that energy demand and looking at low carbon energy sources. We've also spoken about the network itself and how that can bear up with the fact we're sat here with the lights on and we just take that for granted that it will always be the case, that we will have access to electricity. So, I just wondered what your thoughts are around keeping the lights on.\n<Andrew> Keeping the lights on. It's a phrase that turns up a lot, but actually I don't think is terribly helpful when we're thinking about the energy system, from two main perspectives. First is quite a trivial one. It's about lights and we use that as a metaphor that stands for energy. It tends to stand for electricity, and we need to remember that electricity is only a small part of our energy system. It's only about a seventh of the total primary energy that we consume that is coming to us in the form of electricity. So, we need to look much broader at how we produce and consume energy. We need to recognise how much energy is used in heat and in transport. That currently has very little to"}
{"text":" do with the electricity system. So that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is that it sets up the idea that somebody else should be responsible for keeping the lights on and that we are passive beneficiaries of their work. I actually think as we move towards greater penetration of intermittent renewables and potentially inflexible nuclear plants or plants with limited flexibility and we move more demands on to our electricity system, we move heat and road transport towards electrification. Then we're going to have to become more active and involved ourselves as participants in the energy system and become familiar with using energy in a different way.\nI'll give you a trivial example. My wife and I have an electric vehicle at home and we also have an economy 7 tariff which enables us to charge it at a very low rate through the middle of the night on an off-peak basis. Now this has benefits both for the network and for us financially, where we see a much lower cost in our electricity bills. It still requires us to manually set the timer on the vehicle, plug the car in at particular times. Maybe go back out in the cold, after dark to make sure it's set and actually, that's a bit of a burden to be honest. Maybe one that we need to shoulder ourselves. I mean actually, when we think about, going back out at night and plugging the car in is a small additional effort. Also, something that maybe technology providers need to be working on is the integration of those systems. So, we can automate some of this, so that we don't have to have so much manual intervention. So yes, keeping the lights on hides a couple of the really key themes that I think will be part of our energy system transformation in the next decade or two.\n<Vicky> Hmm. So, there's a lot of talk around things like smart grid interventions and that being key for going forwards. This obviously touches on consumer behaviour, as well and changes and shifts in how we live our lives day-to-day and how we ourselves can contribute to the big issues and energy. I guess it'd be really good at this point to ask you, if there's anybody listening out there and thinking what can I do? What's the top tips people could do on a practical level that will make a real impact on mitigating against climate change and our emissions and helping conserve energy as well?\n<Andrew> I think one of the biggest things people can do is speak to their elected representatives. Speak to their local and the national politicians about the climate negotiations that are going to happen in Glasgow. I think the UK is taking a strong leadership position there and being effective is the most significant thing that we can do globally as citizens. The first thing I would say to people to do is, if they think that climate change and energy system transformation is important, is to make sure that their politicians know that that's the case. In terms of what we can do in our own lives, to reduce the quantity of energy that we demand makes it so much easier for the rest of the energy system to be able to meet those demands. So, looking at how much we travel. How energy-intensive that travel is. Looking at how we use heat in our homes, that would be the next thing to do. Now they're not easy things. They're not little things but they're things that will make a big difference. So, I would encourage people to think about their home insulation and what they could do to reduce the amount of heat. Think about the controls in their heating systems. Do they need to be heating all of the house all of the time? Can they get a little bit smarter with some thermostatic radiator valves and maybe some smart controls or just a well-set timer control? Then think about road transport and air transport particularly, because they're the most carbon intensive at present. How far and how frequently we're traveling and are there opportunities to reduce that?\n<Vicky> Fantastic. I shall stock up on my supply of jumpers and thermals to wear around the house.\n<Andrew> Again just as a little kind of personal anecdote on that. Two or three years ago we did a big insulation project on our home and I have been absolutely overjoyed at how the house feels now. All of the rooms are at a moderate comfortable temperature for a much longer part of the day. The house is just so much nicer to be in. It was a lot of upheaval to do the works, but I've been so pleased with it.\n<Vicky> It all pays off doesn't it? Like you say people might think these are options are quite insignificant - what change can I make? - but on that scale little actions actually do contribute a lot.\n<Andrew> Well they do when they are multiplied, when you talk to other people. So, when you talk to the building industry and you say, 'I want higher standards'. When you encourage people to do things slightly differently. When you show and you tell other people"}
{"text":" about it. That's when you begin to see a broader social change. So, I think it's not enough to passively consume some of these technologies, but to actively increase their uptake more broadly.\n<Vicky> Yes, it's great to have all this on the radar isn't it? We talked about keeping the lights on, we need to make sure we're turning them off in rooms where we're not going to be using them, and as we exit from one room to another, and that that kind of thing as well. So, you mentioned COP26. If you could talk to one of the cabinet ministers, have you got any top things you'd be saying to them?\n<Andrew> I think that they should recognise the scale of the issue, because we have been talking and making such limited progress to date, we are making the problem harder and harder for ourselves. So, I would encourage all global leaders to recognise the scale of that challenge and to be able to bring forth some strong collaborations and commitments.\nI think need some progress, particularly in the aviation sector because there hasn't any been to date. It has been moving slowly and is only proposing an offsetting scheme, rather than reductions within the sector. So, I think that that is something that needs to be addressed but that's not going to be the major topic of conversation at COP26. At COP26 we need ambition on the emissions targets that matches the targets that are in the Paris Agreement from 2015.\n<Vicky> So it's joining all that together and working together across countries and getting different politicians committing to all that change.\n<Andrew> I think we're going to need for someone to show some leadership and then bring other people with them. However, that's achieved at international diplomatic levels and so that's really what I think the UK could offer.\n<Vicky> A really good example of what the UK is doing, and Tyndall Manchester were involved in, is the city carbon budgets. The work that was done there by Tyndall Manchester and that's obviously contributing towards GMCA's carbon targets the 2038.\n<Andrew> Yes, what we did there was strip out the negative emissions technologies from many of the future emissions reduction scenarios. So, there's the presumption in lots of government and scientific models that we have technology that takes CO2 out of the atmosphere in the second half of the century. Now that's a big ask, to be able to deliver those technologies at the global scale. It's not to say that the technologies are a pipe dream. We have them as demonstrators, we know they exist but to scale them up is a big risk. So, we took that out and we said what are the safe quantities of emissions that could be fairly allocated to a developed country like the UK? Then how could that be scaled down to the city?\nWhat we found is that we need to have a very significant increases in the rates of reductions than we're seeing at the moment. So, the recent trend has been reductions to the order of about six percent per annum. Slowing last year and that's been due to us getting coal out of the national electricity system. That's a really significant piece of progress but it's a one-off and we need to keep pushing. In fact, we found that we needed to increase that rate of reduction to greater than 10% per annum. So, it's not just the 2038 zero target that we have. It's important we need to know that everything needs to get to zero.\nThat's a fundamental feature of the climate science and the way that CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere. If you don't have carbon emission sucking technologies, then you have to get to zero. Then the other part is that yes we need to be keeping ourselves within our carbon budget and the carbon budget shows us that we need to be looking at greater than 10% per annum reductions and really scaling up our efforts. That perhaps implies coming back to the issues that I mentioned in the introduction. That we think more about how we demand energy and how we demand particularly carbon-intensive energy services because the easiest way of cutting our emissions is to cut our demand especially for services like air travel. That currently have a very high carbon intensity.\n<Vicky> Great thanks John. That's been fantastic. So, the key take out of taken from all this is, we need to act now, and that action needs to be both on the micro and the macro level. All the way from the actions we take as individuals, through to a regional level like GMCA are doing. All the way up to the global and what we're doing together as one planet to save the world.

{"text":"Ministerial Advice (Document)\nby Admin | 19 February 2012\n1. Name and description of the key threatening process\n1.1 Title of the process\nThe introduction in Australian inland waters of native or non-native fish that are outside their natural geographic distribution.\n1.2 Description of the process\nThe introduction of non-native or native fish outside their natural ranges is one of the major conservation issues in inland aquatic environments. Regional differences in fish communities are decreasing as non-native species become established and native species decline and, in some cases, become locally extinct (Rahel, 2002). Worldwide, six areas have been identified as invasion 'hotspots', including southern Australia and New Zealand. In these hotspots, non-native fish represent more than a quarter of the total number of fish species (Leprieur et al., 2008). Approximately 8% of Australia\"s freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction and 25% have significantly declined in distribution or occur in restricted areas (Wager and Jackson, 1993).\nIn Australia, 43 non-native freshwater fish species occur in the wild and, of these, 34 have established populations (Koehn and McKenzie, 2004; Lintermans, 2004). One additional species, rosy barb (Puntius conchonius) is now established in northern and western Australia (Corfield et al., 2008). Five of the species established in Australia were nominated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as among the world\"s 100 most invasive species (Lowe et al., 2000). These are: carp (Cyprinus carpio), Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki),rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)and brown trout (Salmo trutta). There are also at least 53 native species in Australia that have been introduced outside their natural geographic distribution (Lintermans, 2004).\nThere are several pathways that lead to the introduction of native and non-native freshwater fish species. Lintermans (2004) identifies the following human-assisted mechanisms for the introduction, legal or otherwise, of native and non-native freshwater fish species in Australia:\nDiscarding of aquarium fish;\nEscape from aquaculture facilities;\nDeliberate introductions for pest control;\nDeliberate legal or illegal stocking;\nContaminants from fish stocking;\nBait bucket introductions;\nTransfers via water diversions;\nEscape from ponds and dams;\nTransfer on commercial fishing gear;\nDeliberate release for cultural ceremonies and\nContaminants of ballast water in coastal and international shipping.\nOf the 35 non-native species established in fresh waters in Australia, 23 were introduced through aquarium releases (Lintermans, 2004; Corfield et al., 2008). Millions of ornamental fish are kept in aquaria in homes and workplaces around Australia. In 2005 alone, over 15.5 million ornamental fish were imported into Australia, 97% of these being freshwater species (Bureau of Rural Sciences, 2007). Of the remaining 12 species established in Australian waters, eight were introduced by acclimatisation societies, one by aquaculture, one for bio-control and two from ballast water (Lintermans, 2004). These introductions are summarised in Table 1.\nTable 1.

These include: a history of successful establishment outside the species' natural range, characteristics that promote success at multiple stages of the invasion process (for example, wide physiological tolerances), introduction into habitat that matches the species\" native habitat, introduction into a region with comparatively high fish species richness (including other introduced species) and introduction of many (100 or more) individuals at a time.\nThe threatening process concerns the impacts of introduced native and non-native freshwater fish species on Australian native species and ecological communities. It does not include the introduction of native fish species for the purpose of conservation (for example, section on Swan galaxias on page 12). It is recognised, however, that the introduction of native fish species for conservation purposes must be preceded by a comprehensive risk assessment to prevent adverse impacts on the receiving environment.\n1.3 Threats to native species\nThe Committee considers that introduced fish have had, and are continuing to have, adverse impacts on a number of native fish species. This includes native species of blackfish, blue-eyes, cod, galaxioids, gobies, gudgeons, perches, pygmy perches, rainbowfish, and freshwater catfish. Several frog species are also impacted by introduced fish, including the threatened Litoria nannotis(waterfall frog) L. rheocola (common mistfrog), L. spenceri(spotted tree frog) and L. aurea (green and golden bell frog) (Morgan and Buttermer, 1996; White and Pike, 1996; Gillespie, 2001; 2009 in press; Burrows, 2004).\nNative and non-native introduced freshwater fish can impact upon endemic native species through predation and competition, introduction of disease, ecosystem alterations and genetic effects.\n1.3.1 Predation and Competition\nSome introduced fish species prey on native animals, including aquatic insects, small fish, amphibian eggs and tadpoles, and crustaceans (e.g. Barlow et al., 1987; Sanger and Fulton, 1991; Raadik, 1995; Morgan and Buttemer, 1996; Howe et al., 1997; Koehn et al., 2000; Gillespie, 2001; Morgan et al., 2002). In particular, predation by brown trout and rainbow trout has seriously impacted the family Galaxiidae and Gadopsis marmoratus (River Blackfish) (Jackson, 1978; McDowall, 2006; Stuart-Smith et al., 2008).\nCompetition can occur through one species establishing a territory and physically excluding the other species or by both species sharing a resource that is limited (Fletcher, 1986). Introduced fish compete with native fish for food and habitat resources. For example, the decline of the Galaxias pedderensis(Pedder galaxias)following inundation of Lake Pedder was likely to be caused by a combination of predation and competition by brown trout and the native Galaxias brevipinnis(climbing Galaxias) (TSSC, 2005).\nThe Committee notes that further research is required to fully document the impacts of predation and competition by introduced native and non-native fish on native endemic species.\n1.3.2 Introduction of diseases\nThe"}
{"text":" introduction of diseases and parasites through introduced native and non-native species may pose a significant threat to local fish populations. Live aquarium fish are the greatest risk group for introducing aquatic animal diseases in Australia (Corfield et al., 2008). Corfield et al. (2008) reviewed the environmental impacts of introduced ornamental fish in Australia, including the impacts associated with the spread of parasites and pathogens, and showed that 21 ornamental fish species harboured disease agents alien to Australia.\nKey examples include:\nAquarium fish led to the spread of the goldfish ulcer disease that was introduced into Australia via infected goldfish, and which subsequently spread to native fish such as Bidyanus bidyanus(silver perch) (Corfield et al., 2008).\nLernaea (Lernaea cyprinacea) is an introduced parasite that burrows into the fins of infected fish, or in finely-scaled species, into the skin itself. Carp and introduced trout are effective vectors of the parasite. Recreational anglers and fish researchers have noted heavy infestations of native fish by lernaea, particularly the EPBC Act listed species,\nMaccullochella peelii peelii(Murray cod) and Macquaria australasica(Macquarie Perch). Lernaeainfestations may be a significant source of mortality for native fish species. Ebner (2006) documented sub-adult Murray cod killed by heavy lernaea infestation, and Bond (2004) documented reduced swimming performance in Galaxias olidus(mountain galaxias), followed by death of all specimens, in a study in experimental aquaria.\nIntroduced fish are also the source of the Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi), which has caused substantial mortalities in Hypseleotris klunzingeri(Western carp gudgeon) in the Canberra region (Dove et al., 1997). As with lernaea, this parasite has the potential to be a significant source of mortality for native fish species.\nIntroduced redfin perch are the main host for Australia\"s first recorded finfish virus, the Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (EHNV)(Langdon et al., 1986; Whittington and Reddacliff, 1995; Reddacliff and Whittington, 1996; Whittington et al., 1996). EHNV is highly pathogenic to a number of native species, including Macquarie perch, mountain galaxias and silver perch (Langdon, 1989).\n1.3.3 Ecosystem modifications\nThe ability to modify habitats and ecosystems is a trait of many invasive species (Bomford,cited inKoehn, 2004).In particular, carp can destroy or reduce the value of habitat for native fish by increasing turbidity and destroying aquatic plant beds (Roberts et al., 1995; Harris and Schiller, 2001). Introduced fish may lead to changes in algal abundance, leaf litter abundance and water quality (Burrows, 2004).\n1.3.4 Genetic effects\nThe introduction of native or non-native fish species may lead to hybridisation with closely related local native fish species (Moyle, 1976). Non-native fish species established in Australia are not from the same taxonomic families as native fish, and therefore hybridisation is extremely unlikely to occur (Fletcher, 1986; Arthington, 1991). However, introduced native fish can hybridise with endemic native species, leading to reduced genetic fitness and hence viability of endemic native fish populations. Introductions of Murray cod into the Clarence River in northern New South Wales pose a substantial threat to the endangered endemic eastern freshwater cod (Maccullochella ikei) (Rowland, 1993). An experimental programme of cross-breeding Murray cod and eastern freshwater cod in a hatchery produced few viable eggs and an extremely high proportion of physically deformed larvae (Rowland, 1993).\nThere are a number of other native fish species that could be affected by hybridisation if related species are introduced into their range. For example, introductions of silver perch from the Murray-Darling Basin into the Lake Eyre Basin could lead to adverse genetic impacts on Bidyanus welchi (Welch's grunter) (NSW DPI, 2006).\n1.4 Listing status under State and Territory legislation\n\"The deliberate or accidental introduction of live fish into public or private waters within a Victorian river catchment, in which the taxon to which the fish belongs cannot reliably be inferred to have been present prior to the year 1770 AD\" is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.\n\"The introduction of fish to fresh waters within a river catchment outside their natural range' is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the NSWF isheries Management Act, 1994. 'Predation by the plague minnow (Gamb"}
{"text":"usia holbrooki)' is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995.\n2.How judged by the Committee in relation to the EPBC Act criteria\nSection 188(4) of the EPBC Act states:\nA threatening process is eligible to be treated as a Key Threatening Process if:\na)it could cause a native species or an ecological community to become eligible for listing in any category, other than conservation dependent; or\nb)it could cause a listed threatened species or a listed threate ned ecological community to become eligible to be listed in another category representing a higher degree of\nendangerment; or\nc)it adversely affects 2 or more listed threatened species (other than conservation dependent species) or 2 or more listed threatened ecological communities.\nA. Could the threatening process cause a native species or an ecological community to become eligible for listing as Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable?\nThere are a number of species not listed as \"threatened\" under the EPBC Act that are likely to be negatively impacted by introduced fish. However, there are currently insufficient data available to enable quantitative assessment of the impacts on most of these species against this criterion. There is however, evidence that the threatening process could cause Ambassis agassizii(olive perchlet), Galaxias olidus(mountain galaxias) and Nannoperca vittata(western pygmy perch)to become eligible for listing as threatened. This evidence is presented below.\nAmbassis agassizii(olive perchlet)\nThis species' eligibility for listing under the EPBC Act can be assessed using relevant criteria set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000. The species would be considered to be \"vulnerable' if it met any one of the criteria set out in the regulations. The following criterion is relevant in the case of olive perchlet: 'It has undergone, is suspected to have undergone or is likely to undergo in the immediate future, a substantial reduction in numbers'.\nThe olive perchlet (also known as Agassiz's glassfish)is historically known from the Murray-Darling system in South Australia, Victoria, western New South Wales and southern Queensland. The species is also known from coastal drainages of New South Wales and Queensland between Lake Hiawatha (NSW) and the Mowbray River (QLD) (Allen, 1996; Allen et al., 2002).\nThe olive perchlet has declined in geographic distribution in most of the Murray-Darling Basin (Lintermans,2007). It is now extinct in Victoria and only known from a single translocated population in South Australia (Morris et al., 2001; Lintermans, 2007). In New South Wales, previously recorded populations of the olive perchlet are now likely to be locally extinct (Gilligan, 2005). The species is still present in coastal streams from northern NSW to north Queensland (Lintermans, 2007).\nSignificant factors in the species' decline in the Murray-Darling Basin are predation by introduced fish, particularly eastern gambusia and redfin perch, cold water pollution that restricts spawning, habitat degradation and rapid fluctuations in water levels resulting from river regulation (Lintermans, 2007).\nOne introduced fish species, carp, accounts for 58% of the total fishbiomass across the Murray-Darling Basin, and in some rivers more than 90% of the total fish biomass (Native Fish Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin, 2003; Davies et al., 2008). Carp are known to destroy aquatic vegetation through dislodging plants during foraging (Roberts et al., 1995). The olive perchlet inhabits the vegetated edges of rivers, creeks and swamps, and appears to be heavily reliant upon aquatic vegetation for cover (Allen and Burgess, 1990; Moffat and Voller, 2002). The species also uses aquatic vegetation as shelter in which to release its eggs, which then attach to vegetation and rocks (Morris et al., 2000, Lintermans, 2007). Destruction of vegetation by carp is likely to have a significant negative impact on the olive perchlet (Koehn 2004).\nThe Murrumbidgee catchment was invaded by carp in 1972. Although other threats may also have been impacting on the olive perchlet, the invasion of carp closely coincided with the olive perchlet's shift from being relatively common to locally extinct in many parts of the catchment (Gilligan, 2005). Gilligan (2005) states that carp are \"likely to be the principal, or at least a major factor\" in the species\" decline in the catchment. Given the high biomass of carp in the Murray-Darling Basin, habitat degradation caused by carp is also likely to be impacting on the olive perchlet in other parts of the Murray"}
{"text":"-Darling Basin.\nFuture declines in population size and geographic distribution are likely if introduced fish continue to expand into the olive perchlet's habitat. Koehn (2004) noted that there is still potential for carp to expand their range.\nCarp impact on the olive perchlet by destroying habitat required for shelter and reproduction. Local extinctions in the Murrumbidgee catchment are attributed to the impacts of carp and it is likely that they have contributed to the species' decline in geographic distribution throughout the Basin. However, there are a number of threats impacting on the olive perchlet and the current evidence available on the role of introduced fish in the species' decline tends to be circumstantial.\nSummary of assessment:The olive perchlet was historically widespread in the Murray-Darling Basin but its geographic distribution has undergone a significant decline. The Committee considers that this decline is likely to have been accompanied by a commensurate reduction in population numbers. Introduced fish are likely to have been a significant cause of this decline through habitat degradation and predation.\nFurther, the decline in population size may continue due to the continuing threat posed by introduced fish. The level of this threat is not quantified at present but could occur as a result of ongoing expansion of introduced fish distribution, additional expansion as a result of stochastic events (e.g. flood conditions) and through intentional and unintentional human action. The Committee judges that the ongoing spread of introduced fish in the Murray-Darling Basin and other olive perchlet habitat could cause the olive perchlet to become eligible for listing under the EPBC Act.\nGalaxias olidus(mountain galaxias)\nMountaing alaxias constitutes a species complex that is currently under review (Raadik, pers. comm., 2010.). The review aims to identify and describe any forms thatwarrant separate species status (Raadik, 2001). For the purpose of this advice,mountain galaxias is treated as a single species.\nThis species' eligibility for listing under the EPBC Act can be assessed using relevant criteria set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000. The species would be considered 'vulnerable' if it met any one of the criteria set out in the regulations. Two criteria are relevant:\n'It has undergone, is suspected to have undergone or is likely to undergo in the immediate future, a substantial reduction in numbers'; and,\n'Its geographic distribution is precarious for the survival of the species and is limited'.\nThe mountain galaxias occurs from southern Queensland, in tributaries of the upper Darling River system, to eastern South Australia. It is found at moderate to high elevations in rivers draining the Great Dividing Range and associated mountains, and also occurs upstream of Narrandera on the Murrumbidgee River (Morris et al., 2001).\nIntroduced trout predate on and compete with mountain galaxias for food and habitat resources (Fletcher, 1986; Bishop and Tilzey cited in McDowall 2006). A number of studies have shown that introduced trout have caused a decline in the species' abundance through a reduction in area of occupancy. Trout have also fragmented the species' distribution into a number of small, isolated populations (Cadwallader, Jackson and Williams, Jackson and Davies, Jones et al.,Koehn and O'Connor, Lintermans and Rutzou, Lintermans, cited in: Lintermans, 2000).For example, Tilzey (1976) studied the interaction of brown and rainbow trout with mountain galaxias in NSW streams. He found that invasion of a stream containing mountain galaxias by rainbow trout led to the disappearance of mountain galaxias from this location. In the same stream, mountain galaxias still occurred above a waterfall, which presented a natural barrier to trout. The invasion of rainbow trout is likely to have caused the disappearance of the mountain galaxias in the lower section of the stream.\nIn many rivers, mountain galaxias are now only present in upstream areas inaccessible to trout. Lintermans (2000) found that removal of introduced rainbow trout from a stream in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) resulted in recolonisation by mountain galaxias.In this study,rainbow trout were eradicated from a small section of a creek, upstream of an impassable barrier. Introduced trout were not eradicated downstream from the barrier. Following eradication of the rainbow trout, mountain galaxias naturally recolonised the stream. However, recovery of the mountain galaxias did not occur downstream of the barrier, where introduced trout were still present. The results of this study indicate that recovery of the mountain galaxias in this stream was a direct response to the removal of introduced trout. This is consistent with a survey of the lower Cotter River catchment (ACT) in 1990, which found that mountain galaxias only occurred in stream sections where downstream barriers prevented access by introduced trout"}
{"text":" (Lintermans, 2000).\nFuture declines in population size and geographic distribution of mountain galaxias are likely if introduced fish continue to expand into the species\" remaining habitat. This could cause further fragmentation of existing populations and reduced genetic variability.\nThe lack of predator-avoidance behaviour in the mountain galaxias is likely to be a major contributor to the decline of this species (Closs, McDowall, Tilzey cited in Lintermans, 2000). Mountain galaxias and brown trout may also compete for food as their diets overlap (Fletcher cited inFletcher, 1986). Competition for habitat is also possible due to the aggressive, territorial nature of introduced trout (Fletcher, 1986).\nThere is some evidence that the introduced oriental weatherloach may be responsible for a localised decline of mountain galaxias in part of the Ginninderra Creek catchment in the ACT (Environment ACT, 2002).\nOriental weatherloach may affect native species by competing for spawning sites, disturbance or predation of eggs, competition for food and shelter, and alteration of habitat (Lintermans et al., 1990; Environment ACT, 2002). Oriental weatherloach have a mutually exclusive distribution with the mountain galaxias in Halls Creek, ACT. This may represent exclusion by oriental weatherloach or exploitation of habitat unsuitable to mountain galaxias (Lintermans et al., 1990). The distribution of the oriental weatherloach appears to be expanding (Koster et al., 2005) and its spread into the mountain galaxias' habitat could result in future declines.\nSummary of assessment:The mountain galaxias is likely to have previously been extensively and continuously distributed in upland and foothill freshwater habitats within its range. However the species has been adversely affected by predation and competition from introduced fish species.\nThe Committee considers that the species has undergone a substantial reduction in numbers consistent with a substantial reduction in the area of occupancy. The species is currently confined only to places largely inaccessible to introduced fish. The species is also now severely fragmented into a number of small isolated populations, such as above waterfalls or other impassable barriers.\nFurther, the decline in population size and geographic distribution may continue and may be precarious for the species\" survival if the threat of introduction of non-native fish continues. The level of this threat is not yet quantified but is occurring or could occur as a result of ongoing expansion of introduced fish distribution, additional expansion as a result of stochastic events (e.g. flood conditions) or through intentional and unintentional human action.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process could cause the mountain galaxias to become eligible for listing under the EPBC Act.\nNannoperca vittata(western pygmy perch)\nThis species' eligibility for listing under the EPBC Act can be assessed using relevant criteria set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000. The species would be considered to be \"vulnerable\" if it met any one of the criteria set out in the regulations. The following criterion is relevant in the case of western pygmy perch: \"Its geographic distribution is precarious for the survival of the species and is limited'.\nThe western pygmy perch isendemic to Western Australia where it's known from coastal drainages between the Arrowsmith River north of Perth and the Philipps River east of Albany (Allen et al., 2002). The species is one of the most common and widespread native fishes in the south-west (Allen et al., 2002).\nBoth eastern gambusia and redfin perch are threats to the western pygmy perch. In tank-based experiments, the presence of eastern gambusia affected the survival of the western pygmy perch through fin-nipping which lead to parasitic and fungal infections (Gill et al., 1997). In the wild, western pygmy perch are unable to co-exist with eastern gambusia in lenticwaterbodies that don't contain cover. This is due to an increase in the mortality rate through fin-nipping and competition for food and space (Gill et al., 1997). However, in habitats that contain cover, the species do co-exist (Gill et al., 1997).\nRedfin perch is known to predate on the western pygmy perch (Pen and Potter, 1992) and is likely to have eliminated the species from much of the Murray River in Western Australia (Hutchinson, 1991). Hutchinson (1991) found that the two species only co-existed at one of the 17 sites sampled and this site had only been recently invaded at the time of the study. Morgan et al. (2002) found that the western pygmy perch disappeared from the Big Brook Dam of the Warren River shortly after the introduction and proliferation of redfin perch. However, in some situations redfin perch may have little impact on the western pygmy per"}
{"text":"ch, such as in waterbodies where an alternative food source is readily available (Pen and Potter, 1992).\nFuture declines in, and fragmentation of, the western pygmy perch's geographic distribution may occur due to the impacts of introduced fish. Impacts are likely to be greater in environments lacking cover or where food and space become limited, for example when pools contract in size during summer and autumn (Pen and Potter, 1992).\nSummary of assessment:Introduced fish have reduced the abundance of the western pygmy perch in some rivers and changed its distribution through predation, competition and aggressive interactions.\nThe Committee judges that the ongoing spread of introduced fish into the western pygmy perch's habitat, particularly in combination with other threats, such as degradation of habitat leading to reduced cover and refuges, could cause the species to become eligible for listing under the EPBC Act.\nConclusion for Criterion A:The Committee considers that the threatening process is eligible under this criterionas the process could cause three native species, the olive perchlet, mountain galaxias and western pygmy perch, to become eligible for listing as threatened under the EPBC Act.\nB. Could the threatening process cause a listed threatened species or a listed threatened ecological community to become eligible to be listed in another category representing a higher degree of endangerment?\nThere are insufficient data available to assess the threatening process against this criterion.\nC. Does the threatening process adversely affect two or more listed threatened species (other than conservation dependent species) or two or more listed threatened ecological communities?\nAs discussed under \"Threats to Native Species\", a number of species are impacted upon by this threatening process. The following species, listed as threatened under the EPBC Act,are examples that demonstrate the adverse impacts of introduced fish on threatened Australian native species. These species are being affected by introduced fish primarily through predation, competition and habitat degradation. There are also likely to be additional species listed as threatened under the EPBC Act that are affected by this process.\nCraterocephalus fluviatilis (Murray hardyhead)\nGalaxias fontanus(Swan galaxias)\nGalaxias fuscus(barred galaxias)\nGalaxias johnstoni (Clarence galaxias)\nLitoria aurea(green and golden bell frog)\nLitoria booroolongensis(Booroolong frog)\nLitoria spenceri(spotted tree frog)\nMelanotaenia eachamensis(Lake Eacham rainbowfish)\nScaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis (redfin blue eye)\nThe Murray hardyhead is currently listed as \"vulnerable\" under the EPBC Act. The species is endemic to the mid and lower Murray-Darling River system in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.\nThe Murray hardyhead was formerly widespread and abundant, however it has suffered population declines and is now absent from most of its former distribution in the Murray-Darling River system (Ebner and Raadik, 2001; Allen et al., 2002; NSW Fisheries, 2005; Wedderburn et al., 2007, 2008; Backhouse et al., 2008).\nThe species is currently known from approximately 13 populations -nine in South Australia and four in Victoria. As many as 15 populations may have become extinct in the last 50 years (Backhouse et al., 2008). In NSW, there has been only one report of the Murray hardyhead since 1970 (Harris and Gehrke, 1997). A 2004 survey failed to detect populations of the Murray hardyhead at three locations where they had previously occurred in the Murrumbidgee catchment, and it is highly likely that the species is locally extinct (Gilligan, 2005; NSW Fisheries Scientific Committee, 2006).\nThe historical decline in the species' distribution and population size has been attributed to the general threats facing native freshwater fish in the Murray-Darling River system. These includeincreasing salinity, river regulation, decreasing irrigation run-off (to wetlands used as disposal basins), high nutrient levels, acid sulphate soils, environmental contamination, sedimentation, barriers to migration and impacts of introduced fish. The species is now further threatened by many years of extensive dry conditions occurring throughout the Murray-Darling Basin (Backhouse et al., 2008).\nAlthough the precise impact of introduced fish on the species is unknown, its small size, pelagic habit and requirement for aquatic vegetation in which to spawn make it susceptible to predation and habitat degradation (Backhouse et al., 2008). Carp, goldfish, redfin perch and eastern gambusia all currently occur in Murray hardyhead habitat. Predation and competition from carp, redfin perch and eastern gambusia have been identified as threats to the species (NSW Fisheries, 2005; NSW Fisheries Scientific Committee, 2006).\nThe Murrumbidgee catch"}
{"text":"ment was invaded by Carp in 1972. This is likely to be a major factor in the decline of the Murray Hardyhead in this area. Although other threats may also have been impacting on this species, the invasion of carp closely coincided with the species\" shift from being relatively common to locally extinct in many parts of the catchment (Gilligan, 2005). Carp are known to destroy aquatic vegetation, which is required for the Murray hardyhead to spawn and therefore are likely to have contributed to the species\" decline. Gilligan (2005) also notes that carp contributed to declines in populations of the olive perchlet (Ambassis agassizii), southern purple-spotted gudgeon (Mogurnda adspersa)and southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) in this area.\nSummary of assessment: Introduced fish are very likely to be a cause of decline in the population size and distribution of the Murray hardyhead, with local extinctions common in the river system. The behaviour of carp is likely to have had an adverse impact on the species which is susceptible to predation and habitat degradation.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the Murray hardyhead.\nThe Swan galaxias is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species is endemic to Tasmania and occurs naturally in the headwaters of the Swan River and tributaries of the upper Macquarie River in eastern Tasmania (Allen et al., 2002; Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nSince the 1980s, three natural populations of Swan galaxias have experienced severe declines in numbers and the species now has a severely fragmented distribution throughout its habitat (Sanger and Fulton, 1991;Sanger, 1993). The Swan galaxias is currently known from nine isolated natural populations, occupying a total stream length of 11 km (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).The species has also been successfully introduced to several fish-free streams for conservation purposes. These introductions have resulted in nine additional established populations, which occupy a stream length of approximately 30 km (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nThe main threat to the Swan galaxias is predation and competition from introduced fish, including brown trout and redfin perch. The decline in population numbers of the Swan galaxias is largely due to invasion of its habitat by these two introduced species(Sanger and Fulton, 1991; Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006). The Swan galaxias' geographic distribution has also been fragmented into isolated populations as a result of introduced fish. The species is unable to co-exist with introduced trout and all natural populations are limited by the presence of brown trout downstream (Sanger and Fulton, 1991; Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nThe Swan galaxias may also be impacted by the native common jollytail (Galaxias maculatus). The native jollytail was recently introduced into the upper Macquarie River and has become a potential threat to Swan galaxias populations in the catchment (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006). The jollytail has established a large population in the lake and is spreading downstream and into at least one tributary containing Swan galaxias (Jackson, pers. comm., 2006). The jollytail may be able to exclude Swan galaxias through competition for food and habitat, as the Swan galaxias has evolved in the absence of any other galaxias species and the jollytail is possibly a more aggressive species (Jackson,pers. comm., 2006).\nOther potential threats to the Swan galaxias include hydrological effects from vegetation clearing and climate change. The species may also be threatened by the construction of water storage infrastructure as this could lead to inundation of habitat, introduction of non-native fish, destruction of barriers that prevent non-native fish invading Swan galaxias habitat, and alteration of flow regimes (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nSummary of assessment:The Swan galaxias has experienced a reduction in numbers and its geographic distribution is severely fragmented.The species is unable to co-exist with some species of introduced fish. Predation and competition by introduced fish are the main reasons for the decline and habitat change of Swan galaxias in Tasmania. These impacts are likely to result in continued reduction in numbers in the future if introduced native and non-native fish invade other areas of the species' distribution.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the Swan galaxias.\nThe barred galaxias is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species is endemic to south-eastern Australia and is restricted to small tributaries of the upper Goulburn, Big and Acheron Rivers, north of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria (Morris et al., 2001).\nThe barred galaxias has suffered a reduction in numbers over most of its distribution and remaining"}
{"text":" populations are fragmented. Five populations are presumed to have become extinct since the species was first described in the 1930s (Raadik, 1995). The species is currently known from 12 populations occurring in seven small streams (Lintermans and Raadik, 2003). The main threat to the barred galaxias is predation by introduced brown trout and rainbow trout (Raadik, 1995; Morris et al., 2001; Koehn and Raadik, 2003). Introduced trout have expanded into nearly all existing barred galaxias populations and are continuing to expand further into upstream habitats. This has led to a decline in the species\" distribution. There is strong evidence that brown trout and rainbow trout prey directly on adults and juveniles of the species (Raadik, 1995). This threat is exacerbated by the small sizeand fragmentation of existing populations.\nCompetition from introduced trout is also considered to be a threat to the barred galaxias. There is evidence that introduced trout compete with the barred galaxias for food and habitat resources (Shirley, cited in Morris et al., 2001).\nThe barred galaxias may also be threatened by stream sedimentation, reduced runoff to streams and reduced stream shading from the removal of instream cover and vegetation. As known populations are small and isolated they may also be at risk of extinction fromcatastrophic events such as drought, bushfire and landslides (Department of Sustainability and Environment Victoria, 2006).\nSummary of assessment: The barred galaxias has experienced a decline in numbers and its geographic distribution is fragmented across a number of populations due to predation and competition by introduced fish. This decline and fragmentation is likely to continue because introduced fish prey directly on the species and may compete for food and habitat resources.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the barred galaxias.\nThe Clarence galaxias is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species is endemic to Tasmania where it is known from seven populations in small isolated parts of the upper Derwent catchment in the southeastern Central Plateau (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nWhile the historical distribution of Clarence galaxias is unknown, the species was described in 1936 from Brown Marsh Rivulet (Scott, 1936) in the lower part of the Clarence River catchment. It has not been recorded in this system since that time. Brown trout are now common in Brown Marsh Rivulet and appear to have replaced Clarence galaxias completely (Sanger and Fulton, 1991). Clarence galaxias doesn\"t occur in any areas containing brown trout. In addition, all populations are limited downstream due to the presence of brown trout or physically unsuitable habitat(Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nBrown and rainbow trout are thought to prey on and compete with Clarence galaxias (Crook and Sanger, 1997).Heavy predation on Clarence galaxias by illegally introduced rainbow trout has been observed in Johnsons Lagoon (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006). Future declines in population size and geographic distribution of Clarence galaxias are likely if brown trout expand into the species\" remaining habitat. Other predatory non-native species, such as redfin perch, are also likely to be a threat if introduced into the species' habitat (Department of Primary Industries and Water Tasmania, 2006).\nSummary of assessment: Distributional evidence strongly suggests that the distribution and population size of the Clarence galaxias has been adversely affected by introduced fish. The species is unable to co-exist with some species of introduced fish and is threatened by predation and competition. A future decline in population size and geographic distribution may occur if non-native fish expand into the species' remaining habitat.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the Clarence galaxias.\nThe green and golden bell frog is currently listed as vulnerable under the EPBC Act. The species has been recorded along the south-east coast from East Gippsland in Victoria, to Byron Bay in New South Wales (DEWHA Species Profile, 2008). The green and golden bell frog was formerly considered to be an extremely abundant species (NSW Department of Environment and Conservation,2005). Rapid declines in the distribution and abundance of the green and golden bell frog were first noticed in the early 1990s and the species now has only a fragmented distribution throughout this former range (NSW Department of Environment and Conservation,2005; White and Pyke, 1996). The species is considered to be absent from at least 90% of its historical distribution (Mahony, White, cited in NSW Department of Environment and Conservation,2005; White and Pyke, 1996). Surveys of populations throughout the distribution of the green and golden bell frog indicate that many populations are small, with most estimates being less than 20 mature individuals (White and Pyke, 1996).\nThe Draft Recovery Plan for the green and golden bell frog identifies the following factors as possible causes of the species\" decline: habitat loss, modification and disturbance, fragmentation and isolation of habitat,"}
{"text":" predation by introduced fish, disease and water quality (NSW Department of Environment and Conservation,2005).\nThe NSW Scientific Committee determined that predation by eastern gambusia is a serious threat to the green and golden bell frog. Eastern gambusia is known to prey upon eggs and tadpoles of the species (Morgan and Buttermer, 1996; White and Pike, 1996). In addition, breeding by the species is almost completely restricted to water bodies where eastern gambusia is absent (NSW Scientific Committee, 1999). In contrast, studies have shown that amphibian tadpoles possess effective survival traits, such as unpalatability, which allow them to coexist with predatory endemic native fish (Kats et al., Hero et al., cited in Gillespie, 2001).\nOne study found that eastern gambusia significantly reduced tadpole survival in the absence of aquatic vegetation. However, in the presence of aquatic vegetation, the effect was substantially reduced, and no significant impact of eastern gambusia could be detected on the species after three days (Morgan and Buttermer, 1996). These findings indicate that presence of eastern gambusia may significantly affect the survival of tadpoles, but that this is likely to be influenced by habitat structure and tadpole behaviour (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2003).\nSummary of assessment: Introduced fish prey on eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog; this is likely to have led to a decline in population numbers and fragmentation of the species' distribution.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the green and golden bell frog.\nThe Booroolong Frog is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. It was historically known to occur in catchments within the Northern Tablelands, Central Tablelands and Southern Highlands of eastern Australia, predominantly in western-flowing streams of the Great Dividing Range. There are also several historic records of the species from the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range north of Sydney (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2004).\nThe Booroolong frog has undergone a severe decline and is no longer present across more than 50% of its former range. Since 1998, surveys have been undertaken to determine the extent and cause of decline in the species. Although no definite causes have been identified, several threatening processes have been proposed as contributing to the decline, including habitat disturbance, the disease chytridiomycosis, and predation of tadpoles by introduced fish (TSSC, 2007). Nearly all streams currently occupied by the Booroolong frog are also inhabited by a range of introduced fish including brown and rainbow trout, carp, goldfish, redfin perch and eastern gambusia (Gillespie, 1999, 2000; Hunter and Gillespie, 1999). Research has demonstrated that tadpoles of the Booroolong frog are palatable to introduced trout, redfin perch, eastern gambusia and carp (Hunter 2003, Hunter unpublished data). Providing alternative prey and shelter did not change the tadpole consumption rates for redfin perch, eastern gambusia or carp (Hunter unpublished data). This research also showed that Booroolong frog tadpoles were not palatable to two native fish species, mountain galaxias and two-spined river blackfish (Gadopsis bispinosus) (Hunter, 2003, Hunter unpublished data).\nIt is very likely that introduced non-native fish species are adversely affecting the Booroolong frog throughout its distribution. These impacts may be substantial in areas where this species exists in small populations, along small sections of a stream (Hunter, pers. comm., 2006). In addition to predation by introduced non-native fish, the potential for carp to increase suspended sediment loads in streams is likely to impact on the Booroolong frog by reducing the availability of rock crevices used by this species as sites for laying eggs (Anstis et al., 1998; Hunter, pers. comm., 2006).\nSummary of assessment:Introduced fish are a threat to the survival of the Booroolongfrog as they have the potential to prey on tadpoles of the species, and alter the habitat. These, together with other threatening processes, has resulted in a severe decline in the species' geographic distribution.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the Booroolong frog.\nThe spotted tree frog is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species is confined predominantly to the north-west side of the Great Dividing Range between the Central Highlands in Victoria and Mt Kosciuszko in New South Wales (Gillespie and Hollis, 1996).\nThe spotted tree frog is currently known from 13 populations, many of which are small and restricted to relatively short sections of streams(Robertson and Gillespie, 1998). Extensive surveys of the species\" distribution and abundance have revealed that the spotted tree frog suffered significant reductions in numbers in the 1970s and early 1980s (Watson et"}
{"text":" al.,1991;\nRobertson and Gillespie, 1998). Surveys undertaken in 1996 failed to locate the species at four streams where it had previously been recorded. These surveys also failed to detect the spotted tree frog at sites on a further four streams where it had been previously recorded, but located the species elsewhere along those streams (Gillespie and Hollis, 1996). In 1996, a population at Bogong Creek suffered a major decline to extremely small numbers, possibly as the result of severe flooding or disease (Gillespie and Hines, 1999).\nThreats that have been implicated in the decline of the spotted tree frog involve disturbance to streams and in catchments of streams (Gillespie and Hollis, 1996). This includes: timber harvesting, eductor dredging, human disturbance, weed invasion, predation by exotic animals (including introduced non-native fish), impoundments, herbicides, inappropriate fire regimes and possibly grazing (Robertson and Gillespie, 1998).\nGillespie (2001) examined the role of introduced trout in the decline in numbers and population fragmentation of the spotted tree frog and found that the species is susceptible to predation from brown trout and rainbow trout. The study showed that in a stream pool experiment, the presence of rainbow trout significantly reduced survival of tadpoles of the spotted tree frog (Gillespie, 2001). In contrast, native fish species that were capable of preying on tadpoles ate very few of this species. This suggests that tadpoles of the spotted tree frog may be unpalatable to native fish species with overlapping distributions (Gillespie, 2001).\nThe impact of introduced trout predation on developing tadpole survival is expected to be far greater in natural habitats than that observed in the stream pool experiment (Gillespie, 2001). Introduced trout may not directly eliminate the spotted tree frog, but do reduce recruitment levels or restrict populations to certain sections of streams, causing fragmentation and reducing population size (Gillespie, 2001). The distribution of the spotted tree frog in relation to introduced trout, along with differences in age-specific survival between populations, provides evidence of the predatory impact of non-native fish on this species (Gillespie, 2001; 2010).\nAt lower altitudes the species may also be subject to predation by redfin perch, carp and eastern gambusia (Harris, 1999).\nSummary of assessment:Introduced fish are predators of spotted tree frog tadpoles and there is documented evidence of their adverse impact on recruitment success. They may also contribute to the fragmentation of populations. It is likely that introduced fish have contributed to a significant decline in numbers and the fragmentation of populations.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the spotted tree frog.\nThe Lake Eacham rainbowfish is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species was originally thought to occur only in Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tablelands in North Queensland. The specieswas abundant in this location in the 1970s, but became locally extinct by 1987. Additional natural populations have since been found at other locations on the Atherton Tablelands between the Barron and South Johnstone river systems (Allen et al., 2002).\nBarlow et al. (1987) found that the fish fauna in Lake Eacham changed significantly between 1983 and 1987. A number of native species, including the Lake Eacham rainbowfish, underwent a decline in numbers during this period. These declines occurred as populations of introduced native species including the mouth almighty (Glossamia aprion), banded grunter (Amniataba perciodes), archer fish (Toxotes chatareus) and bony herring (Nematalosa erebi) became established in the lake. Although the exact timing of these introductions is unknown, the mouth almighty was first observed in the lake in 1983, the archer fish and the bony herring in 1984, and the banded grunter in 1987 (Barlow et al., 1987).\nThe local extinction of the Lake Eacham rainbowfish was primarily due to interaction with introduced native species, in particular, predation by the mouth almighty (Barlow et al., 1987). Further, the dietary habits of the introduced native species (apart from the bony herring) suggest that they contributed to the decline of the Lake Eacham rainbowfish by predation (Barlow et al. 1987).\nSummary of assessment: Predation by introduced native fish is likely to be a significant factor in the local extinction of the Lake Eacham rainbowfish in Lake Eacham.Extant populations of the species could also be adversely impacted by introduced fish.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the Lake Eacham rainbowfish.\nScaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis(redfin blue eye)\nThe redfin blue eye is currently listed as endangered under the EPBC Act. The species is endemic to Queensland, where it is restricted to Ed"}
{"text":"gbaston Springs north of Aramac. These springs are a single complex emanating from the Great Artesian Basin (Fairfax et al., 2007).\nThe redfin blue eye has been recorded as naturally occurring in eight separate springs (Wager, 1994). The species has suffered a decline in area of occupancy since its discovery in 1990, with five populations becoming extinct (Wager, 1994; Fairfax et al., 2007). In 2006,the species was known from five populations occurring in four springs, two of which were naturally recolonised following previous extirpations (Fairfax et al., 2007). Attempts to translocate the species to springs elsewhere within the complex have failed.Changes in water flow to the springs may have caused these failures (Fairfax et al. 2007).\nEastern gambusia is likely to be a significant threat to the redfin blue eye in the wild and is implicated in the local extirpation of redfin blue eye populations (Wager and Unmack, 2004; Fairfax et al., 2007). In 2006, eastern gambusia was present in four of the five springs where redfin blue eye populations had been extirpated. Four out of the five remaining subpopulations of the species occured in springs that were free from eastern gambusia (Fairfax et al., 2007). Although there was evidence of spatial separation within the spring pool where the species co-occurred, they are forced together when seasonal extremes affect spring size and water temperature (Wager, 1994: Fairfax et al., 2007) and redfin blue eyes have recently become locally extinct in the last pool where they co-existed with eastern gambusia (Fensham personal communication).\nEastern gambusia has been observed nipping the tail fins of redfin blue eyes (Unmack and Brumley, 1991; Wager, 1994). This occurs particularly where eastern gambusia are larger than redfin blue eyes (Wager, 1994). Wager (1994) attributed the absence of juvenile redfin blue eyes in one spring to predation of eggs or fry by eastern gambusia. Domestic stock, feral goats and pigs that utilise the springs and can negatively affect water quality and flow patterns are likely to intensify the impact of eastern gambusia. Water levels and flow have also declined due to the construction of artesian bores (Faifax et al., 2007) and this is likely to negatively affect the species.\nSummary of assessment:The redfin blue eye has experienced a decline in area of occupancy associated with the extinction of populations from several springs. Adverse impacts from introduced fish are likely to be a significant factor in these extinctions. These impacts include aggressive interactions (fin nipping) and possibly predation on the eggs or fry of redfin blue eyes. Redfin blue eyes now exist only in pools that have not yet been reached by eastern gambusia.\nThe Committee judges that this threatening process is adversely affecting the redfin blue eye.\nConclusion for Criterion C:The Committee considers that the threatening process is eligible under this criterion as the process is adversely affecting population numbers and geographic distribution of at least nine listed threatened species, primarily through predation, competition and habitat degradation.\nCONCLUSION: The threatening process does not meet s188(4)(b) of the EPBC Act. However, the threatening process does meet s188(4)(a) and s188(4)(c) of the EPBC Act, and is therefore eligible to be listed as a Key Threatening Process\n3.Threat Abatement Plan Recommendation\nDegree of threat\nThirty five non-native species are established in Australian freshwaters and at least 53 Australian native species have been introduced outside their natural geographic distribution. These introductions have resulted in adverse impacts on a number of fish and frog species, including many listed as threatened under the EPBC Act. Native species, such as the Murray hardyhead, have experienced both a reduction in numbers and local extinctions of populations. Some species, including the mountain galaxias, are no longer found in rivers where they previously occurred and have undergone a decline in geographic distribution. This is largely a result of predation, competition and degradation of habitat by introduced fish. The impacts of disease and hybridisation have also contributed to declines in some cases.\nPotential of threatened species and ecosystems to recover\nThe threats posed by introduced native and non-native fish can be controlled by preventing further spread into new habitats, eradication of introduced fish and rehabilitation of ecosystems. Threatened species have the ability to recover from the impacts of introduced fish in Australia. Local eradications of introduced fish have led to re-colonisation of habitats by native endemic species. Some species, such as the Swan galaxias, have been successfully introduced to new streams for conservation purposes.\nThreat abatement actions\nThe table below outlines areas for threat abatement, initiatives underway in each area and options for implementing additional actions. This has been developed to highlight areas where the"}
{"text":" development of a Threat Abatement Plan could assist in implementing actions.\n1. Policy Coordination\nThreat abatement area\nRecommended (additional) action\na. An aligned legislative framework for preventing and controlling the introduction of freshwater fish would assist in a coordinated approach to management across jurisdictions. Agreement has been reached via the Vertebrate Pests Committee Pest Fish Working Group on an interim list of significant pest fish. The Pest Fish Working Group are taking the lead on developing a comprehensive strategy to address this issue including policy, surveillance, control plans, research,species prioritisation, response, communication and resourcing. Specific legislative changes would need to be undertaken by individual states and territories to achieve an aligned legislative framework in this area.This would not be aided by a TAP.\nb. Define key biodiversity assets -Introduced fish in many cases are well established and eradication is not feasible at all sites. Therefore, action should focus on achieving an outcome of protecting native species and ecological communities while acknowledging the need to focus on gaining maximum benefit possible with limited resources. This may be achieved by determining which inland waters are key to the native species impacted by this Key Threatening Process, then developing management plans (including monitoring) for introduced species at each identified water body. State and Territory Government fish stocking policy\/plans recognise some inland waters as important for native species. There is potential for additional action to be undertaken through existing mechanisms including the Pest Fish Working Group and by encouraging further consideration of protecting the identified key inland waters in state and territory fish stocking policy\/plans.\nA voluntary review could be undertaken of current state and territory strategies related to stocking and\/or a national policy could be developed for adoption by state and territory jurisdictions.\nThese actions would not be aided by a TAP.\n2. Prevention\na. Prevent the entry of certain live fish to Australia -Entry of live fish to Australia, especially aquarium species, via the large permitted live fish list under the EPBC Act 1999 and Quarantine Act 1908 heightens the risk of new introductions to inland waters. The Ornamental Fish Management Implementation Group (OFMIG), under the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, has developed an agreed list of high-risk noxious aquarium species. A \"grey\" list has also been developed that requires further scientific investigation to determine if they should be added to, or exempt from, the national noxious species list. A process is in place to assess these \"grey\" list species. No additional actions are recommended. Therefore, a TAP is not required to address this area.\nb. Educate the public about introduced fish (both non-natives and natives outside their natural range) to try to stop introductions (other than approved stocking) in designated sites.\nDevelop and disseminate public education material about the potential for introductions of introduced fish via dumping unwanted fish, use of introduced fish as live bait and accidental movement. Currently the OFMIG is developing a strategy in consultation with the ornamental fish industry to undertake this education. The Australian Government can assistwith public education through website promotion and sharing information with other stakeholders such as the Vertebrate Pests Committee.\nThe Pest Fish Working Group could consider augmenting the OFMIG strategy to cover non-ornamental species. As this is underway, a TAP is not required to undertake this action.\n3. Early Warning and Rapid Response\na. Develop and disseminate public education material and guidelines for encouraging passive monitoring for new incursions and a protocol to follow in the event of a suspected incursion. High risk areas that are key for surveillance should be identified. None identified. General principles could be developed by the Pest Fishing Working Group under their comprehensive strategy. However, as this is local area information it would need to be undertaken at a state and territory level. This action would not be aided by a TAP\nb. Develop guidelines for the rapid eradication of new incursions of introduced fish or incursions to new areas, determine who would undertake an eradication and seek their in-principle agreement. None identified. Principles could be developed and agreed at a national level through the Pest Fish Working Group. Jurisdictions would need to undertake actions in conjunction with the National Environmental Biosecurity Response Agreement for new incursions or to apply these principles at the local management level for incursions to new areas. This action would not be aided by a TAP.\n4. Containment and control\nPotential abatement actions include exclusion of introduced fish from sites identified key for the conservation of a species. Further discussion of these actions are outlined under section \"1. Policy Coordination: Definingkey biodiversity assets'.\n5. Research and Developmen\na. Identify those species that currently impact on a national scale or have the potential to impact on a national scale The Australian Government has commissioned the following four reports to identify these species and their impacts:\n-An overview of the impacts of translocated native fish species in Australia (2008)\n"}
{"text":"-Review of the impacts of gambusia, redfin perch, tench, roach, yellowfin goby and streaked goby in Australia (2008)\n-Review of the impacts of introduced ornamental fish species that have established wild populations in Australia (2008)\n-Review of the literature on the impacts of introduced salmonids on Australian native freshwater fish (In draft). Each report identifies priority research requirements which have been compiled into a table of priorities and time frames. These priority research requirements could be circulated to relevant stakeholders. A TAP is not required to undertake this action.\nb. Technical information on practical management strategies that can be applied under Australian conditions. An understanding of the level of control and method of control is necessary. None identified. On-ground management is the responsibility of individual jurisdictions and the technical requirements will vary across Australia. Individual jurisdictions may need to develop these data, although the collation of technical information for all jurisdictions to use is recommended. This would be best done through the Vertebrate Pests Committee to encourage participation from all jurisdictions. This action will not be aided by a TAP.\nc. Risks involved with aquaculture diseases and fish stocking including quality scientific data on impacts on native fish and aquatic communities, population genetic structure, carrying capacity, and monitoring. None identified Specific regulatory changes would need to be undertaken by individual states and territories. This will not be aided by a TAP.\nd. Improving the knowledge of the behavioural and biological traits of the introduced species to identify how control actions may be more effectively and efficiently applied. Carp Hotspots work by the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre has identified a limited number of breeding locations for carp in the Murray Darling Basin. Additional action could include identifying specific research requirements. This could be done through a TAP.\n6. Public Education Awareness and Involvement\na. Education about established introduced species and what action stakeholders can take for effectively reducing the impact from the introduced species. This action would needto be linked to the identified priority sites (threat abatement area 1b). Provide information on the best methods for reducing the impacts from invasive fish species generally so that action can be effective in the long term. None identified Guidance could be provided through the OFMIG and Pest Fish Working Group, but implementation would need to be undertaken by state and territory governments and local community groups. This action could be guided by a TAP.\nScientific information about pest fish impacts could be made available on the DEWHA website and via the OFMIG and Pest Fish Working Group. Links could be established to information held by jurisdictions and research organisations. A TAP is not required to undertake this action.\nCONCLUSION: The preceding analysis shows that while there are some existing initiatives in place to address the threats from this process, there are also a number of additional actions that could be undertaken. However, a national Threat Abatement Plan is not considered to be the most efficient and effective way to undertake these actions. Instead, the Committee recommends that additional actions be implemented through current initiatives, including the Ornamental Fish Management Implementation Group and the Vertebrate Pests Committee Pest Fish Working Group. In addition, the Committee recommends that relevant stakeholders, including recreational fishing groups, should be engaged in these processes.\nThe Committee has prepared \"Threat Abatement Guidelines\" which provide a summary of the Key Threatening Process along with advice on what additional threat abatement actions could be undertaken.\nThe Committee further recommends that the Australian Government undertake additional actions in line with these \"Threat Abatement Guidelines\" and report on the progress of this as part of the five year statutory review on whether to have a Threat Abatement Plan for this Key Threatening Process.\nThe Committee recommends that:\nA. The list referred to in section 183 of the EPBC Act be amended by including in the list of Key Threatening Processes: \"The introduction of native or non-native fish into Australian inland waters that are outside their natural geographic distribution.\"\nB. A Threat Abatement Plan is not considered a feasible, effective and efficient way to abate the process at this time.\nC. The Committee\"s Threat Abatement Guidelines be considered when undertaking actions in relation to this Key Threatening Process.\nD. The Australian Government undertake additional actions in line with these Threat Abatement Guidelines and report on the progress of this as part of the five year statutory review on whether to have a Threat Abatement Plan for this process.\nThreatened Species Scientific Committee 24 May 2011\nReferences cited in the advice\nAllen GR (1996).

Microalgae are of interest as a feedstock because of their high growth rates and tolerance to varying environmental conditions, and because the oils (lipids) they produce can be extracted and converted to substitute petroleum fuels such as biodiesel. Microalgae can be grown in arid and semi-arid regions with poor soil quality, and saline water from aquifers or the ocean can be used for growing microalgae. Biodiesel is an extremely attractive candidate to fulfill the need for a diesel fuel substitute. Biodiesel is a cleaner fuel than petroleum diesel; it is virtually free of sulfur, and emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulates during combustion are significantly reduced in comparison to emissions from petroleum diesel. Biodiesel provides essentially the same energy content and power output as petroleum-based diesel fuel.\nCreator: Brown, L.; Jarvis, E.; Dunahay, T.; Roessler, P.; Zeiler, K.

A Geopressured well in Texas (Pleasant Bayou) will undergo a slow test and a pressure buildup test. A geopressured well in Louisiana (Gladys McCall) will be flow tested for a short period, logged, plugged and abandoned or turned over to industry early in FY 92. A second deep geopressured well in Louisiana, the Hulin Well, is being kept on standby. Related university research in geology, numerical reservoir modeling, subsidence, microseismicity, and water quality will continue, with program data reviews initiated in appropriate areas. Increased emphasis on integrated reservoir engineering will be implemented. The well activities coupled with the related university research are designed to improve the ability to forecast reservoir productive capacity, to verify the reliability of the resource as a long-term energy resource, and to determine the environmental effects of long-term production. By these means, the Geopressured-Geothermal Research Program is developing a solid technology base that private industry can use to evaluate the geopressured-geothermal resource. The Industrial Consortium for utilization of the resource will be continued. Use projects in Louisiana and Texas will be evaluated. A geopressured reservoir review will be managed by INEL. The DOE Field Office, Idaho will make preparations to complete the program. [DJE-2005]\nDescription: Phase 1 of the HEDR Project was designed to develop and demonstrate a method for estimating radiation doses people may have received from Hanford Site operations since 1944. The method researchers developed relied on a variety of measured and reconstructed data as input to a modular computer model that generates dose estimates and their uncertainties. As part of Phase 1, researchers used the reconstructed data and computer model to calculate preliminary dose estimates for populations from limited radionuclides, in a limited geographical area and time period. Phase 1 ended in FY 1990. In February 1991, the TSP decided to shift the project planning approach away from phases--which were centered around completion of major portions of technical activities--to individual fiscal years (FYs), which span October of one year through September of the next. Therefore, activities that were previously designated to occur in phases are now designated in an integrated schedule to occur in one or more of the next fiscal years into FY 1995. Task plans are updated every 6 months. In FY 1992, scientists will continue to improve Phase 1 data and models to calculate more accurate and precise dose estimates. The plan for FY 1992 has been prepared based on activities and budgets approved by the Technical Steering Panel (TSP) at its meeting on August 19--20, 1991. The activities can be divided into four categories: (1) model and data evaluation activities, (2) additional dose estimates, (3) model and data development activities, and (4) technical and communication support. 3 figs., 2 tabs.\nHot Dry Rock Energy Annual Report Fiscal Year 1992\nDescription: Hot Dry Rock technology took a giant leap forward this year as the long-awaited long-term flow test (LTFT) of the Phase II HDR reservoir at Fenton Hill got underway. Energy"}
{"text":" was produced on a twenty-four hour a day basis for a continuous period of nearly four months of steady-state testing. Hot water was brought to the surface at 90-100 gallons per minute (gpm) with temperatures of 180[degrees]C (356[degrees]F) and higher. During that time, the HDR plant achieved an on-line record of 98.8%. Surface temperature measurements and temperature logging deep within the wellbore confirmed that no decline in the average temperature of fluid produced from the reservoir occurred. Tracer experiments indicated that flow paths within the reservoir were undergoing continuous change during the test. Remarkably, it appeared that longer flow paths carried a larger proportion of the flow as the test proceeded, while more direct fluid pathways disappeared or carried a significantly reduced flow. In sum, access to hot rock appeared to improve over the span of the test. Water losses during the test averaged 10-12% and showed a slow long-term decline. These results confirmed what had been previously discovered in static pressurization testing: Water consumption declines significantly during extended operation of an HDR reservoir. In combination with a recent demonstration by the Japanese that water losses can be greatly reduced by the proper placement of multiple production wells, the recent results at Fenton Hill have effectively demonstrated that excessive water consumption should not be an issue for a properly engineered HDR facility at a well chosen site.\nCreator: Winchester, Willanne W. & Bigio, Ruth\nHydrogen Energy Coordinating Committee annual report: Summary of DOE hydrogen programs for FY 1991--1992\nDescription: The Hydrogen Energy Coordinating Committee (HECC) was established over 14 years ago to ensure that the many varied aspects of hydrogen technology research and development within the Department are coordinated.

Letter Report on FY 1992 Activities\nDescription: The US Department of Energy (DOE) set up the Underground Storage Tank Integrated Demonstration Program (USTID) to demonstrate technologies for the retrieval and treatment of tank waste, and closure of underground storage tanks (USTs). There are more than 250 underground storage tanks throughout the DOE complex. These tanks contain a wide variety of wastes including high level, low level, transuranic, mixed and hazardous wastes. Many of the tanks have performed beyond the designed lifetime resulting in leakage and contamination of the local geologic media and groundwater. To mitigate this problem it has been proposed that an interim subterranean containment barrier be placed around the tanks. This would minimize or prevent future contamination of soil and groundwater in the event that further tank leakages occur before or during remediation. Use of interim subterranean barriers can also provide sufficient time to evaluate and select appropriate remediation alternatives. The DOE Hanford site was chosen as the demonstration site for containment barrier technologies. A panel of experts for the USTID was convened in February, 1992, to identify technologies for placement of subterranean barriers. The selection was based on the ability of candidate grouts to withstand high radiation doses, high temperatures and aggressive tank waste leachates. The group identified and ranked nine grouting technologies that have potential to place vertical barriers and five for horizontal barriers around the tank. The panel also endorsed placement technologies that require minimal excavation of soil surrounding the tanks.\nCreator: Heiser, J.

{"text":"Finkel report: A blueprint for reform that will take us half way there\nOur thoughts at a glance:\nThe final Finkel report broadly seeks to respond the two key policy challenges facing Australian energy policy \u2013 being (a) the need to better manage the integration of renewables into the NEM; and (b) to respond to the global trend towards a more intelligent and decentralised electricity supply chain.\nOn the first issue \u2013 policy to support system security \u2013 the report responds with a number of concrete and valuable proposals, the three central elements of which include:\na technology neutral Clean Energy Target (CET) which would reward all new generators that produce electricity below a specified emissions intensity threshold \u2013 rather than the Renewable Energy Target, which currently only subsidises renewable generation. It remains to be seen whether the CET will be sufficient to incentivise significant fresh investment into gas-fired generation, given the high cost of gas;\nrequiring all generators to provide at least three years' notice prior to closure to ensure better management of generator closures (exactly how these regulations would operate in circumstances where a generator's owner was no longer willing to operate the asset, invest in maintaining it or was in financial difficulty remains to be seen); and\na Generator Reliability Obligation for new generators such as wind and solar which will apply to new investment in a region where the level of dispatchable capacity falls below a certain threshold.\nOn the second issue \u2013 the need to adjust our framework to reflect the longer term disruption that is occurring in the grid \u2013 the findings are less concrete and there are some significant deficiencies. In particular, the Report:\ndoesn't deal with smart meters or electric vehicles, in any material way;\nis shallow when wrestling with the critical issue of price signals and tariffs;\nwrongly assumes that all individual consumer behaviour around DER (particularly demand management and storage) will be beneficial for network costs; and\ndespite recognising we face \"paralysis by analysis\" \u2013 still refers most key questions for further review and creates an entirely new regulatory body.\nIn our update last Friday we summarised the key recommendations in Dr Alan Finkel's Final Report on the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market. As we noted, the Final Report is a comprehensive document and contains 50 individual recommendations in support of a wide-ranging policy vision for the future of the NEM.\nThe Final Report deals with many of the issues that we raised in our recent White Paper, 'Wrestling with the Electricity market Transformation'. In that White Paper we identified two distinct policy challenges facing the NEM:\nthe decentralisation of the energy ecosystem as a result of new technology and falling costs, with major implications for the design and operation of the grid; and\nwholesale market design, the impact of the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and changes in the nature of generation has raised questions about the ability of the current energy-only wholesale market design to deliver reliable and cost effective electricity supply.\nIn our view, the Final Report has delivered a number of clear, actionable and important recommendations to deal with the second of these challenges. The Finkel report recommends a number of specific measures to increase the security of electricity supply, emphasises the need for an orderly transition to a low carbon environment with a clear policy direction and stresses the importance of more efficient gas markets in delivering that orderly transition. These are welcome and important policy recommendations.\nWe are less sure that the Final Report has delivered a clear road-map to allow the grid to manage the disruption posed by decentralisation of the energy ecosystem in an efficient and cost-effective way. The key recommendations in the report in relation to improved system planning identify the key issues, but give little specific guidance on the future direction to be taken.\nThe Final Report focusses on the importance of rewarding consumers for the benefits that individual actions such as demand management and storage can have to the broader system. However, it does not clearly identify that the actions of individual consumers can also have negative effects on the efficient operation of the broader system and the importance of ensuring that price signals are properly aligned with the total cost of individual actions. It is an easy political sell to suggest that consumers should be rewarded for taking actions such as installing solar panels or battery storage, but it is equally important to ensure that the system-wide costs of such actions are taken into account. For example, customers should continue to properly contribute to the cost of maintaining their connection to the grid even if they use that connection less frequently.\nCiting a Productivity Commission report, the Final Report noted a danger that the policy process in the NEM can sometimes descend into \"paralysis by analysis\". While we are hopeful that the proposed Blueprint will help move past analysis into action, and welcome the recommendation that COAG recommit to a national approach to energy matters, on our reading only 15 of the recommendations are for specific actions to be taken, with the others highlighting important issues and recommending that other bodes develop plans or investigate matters (including the key recommendations around the future of"}
{"text":" and governance arrangements in relation to the grid such as recommendations 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5). We also remain to be convinced that the formation of yet another body in this sector (the Energy Security Board) will contribute to more streamlined decision making process.\nOverall, the Final Report outlines a blueprint for action that seems well suited to addressing the short to medium term risks facing the NEM in terms of security and reliability of wholesale supply. These issues are clearly pressing and the recommendations on these issues are, for the most part, specific and able to be implemented. However, the report has not grappled with the longer term disruptive forces facing the electricity system. Nor does it provide a specific plan on how to ensure that this disruption is implemented in a coordinated manner that works for all users of the system, rather than allowing some users to take advantage of inefficient price signals and regulatory or policy regimes.\nDetailed overview of the Final Report\nThe remainder of this update examines the individual elements of the Final Report in more detail, other than the first section that outlines the measures that are currently being taken to improve the resilience of the NEM ahead of the FY18 summer.\nChapter 2 \u2013 Increased security\nThe Final Report defines energy security as the power system's capacity to operate in the event of emergencies such as unexpected loss of generation or load. It identifies emerging threats to energy security from natural and human sources such as cyber-attacks and extreme weather conditions and highlights that there has been a reduction in the supply of essential services that help to maintain system security such as physical inertia due to:\nincreased penetration of variable renewable electricity generators; and\nwithdrawal of synchronous generators.\nIn order to maintain a steady supply of security services, the Panel makes 12 recommendations in relation to security including that:\na package of Energy Security Obligations be adopted which requires transmission network service providers to provide and maintain a sufficient level of inertia, mandates that new generators have fast frequency response capability and an update to connection standards;\nthe AEMC review the regulatory framework for allowing distributed energy resources to participate in the provision of system security and subsequent measures to better incentivise and orchestrate such participation;\nAEMO revise the black system restart plans for each NEM region in case there is a system-wide blackout and regularly test black start equipment and processes;\nthe Energy Security Board prepare an annual report on cyber security preparedness of the NEM.\nThese recommendations have benefited from detailed work done by other bodies, particularly AEMO's analysis of past system security events and the ENA \/ CSIRO's Electricity Network Transformation Roadmap and are generally well targeted and actionable, providing a good platform for future reform in this area.\nChapter 3 \u2013 A reliable and low emissions future\nEveryone who has worked in or been exposed to the electricity sector understands that uncertainty in the political sphere about carbon abatement policy has created a hostile climate for investment in the NEM over the past decade. This fact informs the key insight in the Final Report, which is that the costs of 'business as usual' are higher than committing to a long term emissions plan (Figure 2). The Final Report notes that \"For a sector characterised by very high-cost and long-lived assets, policy transparency, credibility and durability are key.\"\nAccording to the Panel, the singular most important feature of a carbon abatement policy is to ensure it is adopted quickly by government and has wide support to stimulate investor confidence. The Panel recommends:\nimplementing a technology neutral Clean Energy Target (CET) for the electrical sector in order to reward all new generators that produce electricity below a specified emissions intensity threshold;\nregulations that all generators must provide at least three years' notice prior to closure to ensure better management of generator closures \u2013 exactly how these regulations would operate in circumstances where a generator's owner was no longer willing to operate the asset, invest in maintaining it or was in financial difficulty remains to be seen; and\nAs with the recommendations in relation to increased security, these are clear, specific and actionable recommendations that lay a sound platform for reform. The CET and Generator Reliability Obligation are discussed in more detail below.\nClean Energy Target (CET)\nThe CET is a technology neutral mechanism which aims to provide incentives to encourage low emissions generation (such as wind and gas) while not directly imposing a penalty on high emissions generation. All forms of electricity generation are eligible for the scheme as long as they produce electricity below the specified emissions intensity threshold. The report does not recommend what this threshold should be, but the modelling exercise relied on by Review (which was calibrated to achieve a 28% reduction in emissions by 2030) set a threshold of 600kg of CO2\/MWh. Under a CET, eligible generators would receive certificates for the electricity produced below the relevant threshold and retailers would be required to buy these certificates to show that a pre-determined share of their electricity is sourced from low emissions generators.\nTo avoid significant disruption to the energy sector it is recommended that the RET"}
{"text":" would continue to operate until 2020 in its current form. The CET would then commence after the expiry of the RET.\nIn our white paper, we urged policy makers to consider an emissions intensity scheme (EIS), which is generally regarded as the most efficient way to achieve carbon abatement goals. The panel grapples with the choice between a CET and EIS, and suggest that:\nthe single most important characteristic of any emissions reduction mechanism to be adopted by governments is that it is agreed expeditiously and with sufficient broad-based support that investors can be confident it will endure through many electoral cycles.\nthe Panel is hesitant to argue definitively that one mechanism, between the EIS and the CET, is superior to the other. The differences in theory may be less significant than how well the chosen scheme is implemented and aspects of its detailed design, such as a predictable process for parameter changes and a robust and proportionate compliance and enforcement regime.\nThe Final Report also notes that the CET would build directly on the experience of operating the RET, which was well understood by market participants. These points are well made and ultimately the difference between the two schemes is one of degree \u2013 both share the same desirable feature of being technologically neutral, and in that respect are a clear improvement on the RET.\nGenerator Reliability Obligation\nTo promote reliability in the electricity supply, the panel recommends that the AEMC oversee a new Generator Reliability Obligation that would be imposed on variable renewable electricity (VRE) generators connecting to the NEM. Under the arrangement, there will be a (non-specified) minimum dispatchable capacity required for each region to maintain system security and reliability. In circumstances where there are high levels of VRE penetration in a particular region, the Generator Reliability Obligation would help ensure sufficient dispatchable generation can bolster the electricity supply in order to maintain reliability.\nDrawing on work done by AGL, the Final Report calculates presents information on the levelised cost of new generation taking into account the cost of 'firming' that capacity (Figure 3). If these figures, which assume continued downward trend of pricing in wind and solar, are representative then renewable generation would still be highly cost effective even under a reliability obligation.\nChapter 4 \u2013 More efficient gas markets\nThe Final Report, correctly notes that gas and electricity markets are highly dependent. As aging coal-fired generation retires, it can be substituted with gas-fired generation, which is a reliable, dispatchable source of supply that is significantly lower in emissions intensity than coal. The Final Report finds that in the short to medium-term, the NEM is likely to depend on flexible, gas-fired generation to support VRE generation. However, due to the rising price of gas and depletion of gas supplies, the gas market needs to be highly efficient if gas fired generators are to contribute to an affordable electrical supply.\nThe Report notes the significant increases of east coast prices in recent years, driven in large part by the LNG projects in in Queensland which have linked Australia to international gas prices. These price increases have a very significant impact on the short run costs of gas fired generators.\nTo help ensure additional gas supplies and secure affordable gas prices, the Final Report contains a number of recommendations, including that:\nAEMO should be given greater oversight power of gas supply contracts for gas-fired generators;\nGovernments should help ensure the safe exploration and production of unconventional gas, (including fair compensation for landowners) by working with communities and industry;\nto assist in securing public support for gas exploration and development, measures be taken to improve the transparency and accessibility of Gas industry performance data e.g. seismic activity, fracking fluid composition, aquifer purity and fugitive emissions.\nOne of the most significant barriers to securing reliable and affordable domestic gas supplies is public opposition to exploration and extraction of onshore gas resources in NSW and Victoria. The measures proposed in the Final Report seem like a sensible way to help move the debate forward, although whether they are able to overcome the intense opposition to gas development in some communities remain to be seen.\nChapter 5 - Improved system planning\nThe Final Report highlights the importance of a more strategic approach to transmission planning. Transmission network planning increasingly needs to take into account future deployments of large-scale and distributed VRE generation which will increase as coal-fired generation exits the market.\nWhile recognising the challenges facing the transmission sector, the recommendations in the Final Report in relation to this issue are much less specific than those relating to the wholesale market. They include recommendations that:\nAEMO develop an integrated grid plan to facilitate the development and connection of renewable energy zones across the NEM;\nthe COAG Energy Council review the ways in which AEMO's role in transmission planning can be enhanced; and\nthe COAG Energy Council commission a review of the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission by mid-2020.\nOther than the recommendation relating to the pre-existing proposed reforms to the Limited Merits Review regime (5.4), none of the recommendations"}
{"text":" in relation to systems planning are specific, clear and actionable. This is disappointing. There is no substantive discussion of difficult and important issues such as network tariffs or the way in which overly stringent ring-fencing obligations may create barriers to transmission networks being able to properly assess the desirability of non-network investments.\nChapter 6 - Rewarding consumers\nThe Final Report recommends that all electricity be rewarded for their actions that enhance the reliability and security of the NEM. Such actions include demand response, provision of system security services and allowing distributed resources to be orchestrated in line with broader system needs. The Final Report also recommends that network provides be provided with appropriate incentives to invest in non-network technologies.\nTo help incentivise such activities, the Final Report suggests, among other things, that:\nthe ACCC make recommendations on how to improve the transparency and clarity of electricity retail prices to help improve customer engagement with the electricity market;\nthe AEMC be directed to undertake a review to recommend a mechanism to facilitate demand response in the wholesale energy market; and\nthat a study be commissioned to determine whether network businesses are more powerfully incentivised to make capital investments rather than undertake operational expenditure on demand-side measures.\nThe Final Report correctly emphasises the importance of orchestration of DER resources to achieve the potential system-wide benefits of their deployment. Unfortunately, the Final Report contains no specific recommendation as to how orchestration could be achieved or incentivised.\nIn the absence of such orchestration, or a change in price signals, there is a risk that those able to afford the initial costs of DER installation will receive benefits but those that do not will be forced to pay a greater share of network and system costs. The Final Report observes that low income consumers and those that rent or occupy high-density buildings are unlikely to install DER systems themselves. As a result, in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that such deployments to result in system wide benefits, these users will bear the brunt of the costs of the transformation of the electricity system without sharing in its benefits. This is a pressing issue, and will need to be grappled with, but the Final Report provides no clear guidance on the path forward which is disappointing.\nAlso notable is that the Final Report highlights the importance of smart meters in enabling many of these mechanisms to reward consumer behaviour, but does not contain any discussion of how installation of these meters can be encouraged. In addition, the Final Report does not contain any discussion about the importance of Australia having a long term strategic plan for the integration of electric vehicles into the grid. This is a missed opportunity, as electric vehicles represent a long term development that has the potential to cause major changes to the level and location of electricity demand in the NEM, and this should be coordinated.\nChapter 7 \u2013 Stronger governance\nThe Final Report notes the importance of strong and resilient energy governance in achieving a secure and reliable low emissions system. It states that good governance requires institutions such as the AER, AEMO, and the AEMC to be 'trusted, capable, empowered and accountable', able to act in a coordinated and timely way to the rapid changes that will occur in the NEM.\nThe Final Report highlights the critical role of the COAG Energy Council, which is responsible for coordinating NEM institutional arrangements. The Final Report highlighted that the Vertigan Review had found that the Energy Council lacked strategic direction and suggested that, while improvements had been made, more needs to be done to deliver active policy leadership in the energy industry. To address this, the Panel recommends that the Energy Council develop and implement a strategic energy plan informed by the Panel's blueprint. The Final Report also recommends that the Vertigan Review proposals relating to rules change process be implemented by the end of 2017 and that further optimisation be considered by the ESB and other bodies.\nThe Final Report also recommends the establishment of a non-statutory body, the Energy Security Board (ESB). The ESB would be comprised of the chairs of the AEMC and the AER and the Chief Executive of AEMO and two independent members. The ESB would be responsible for overseeing and implementing the Finkel Review's blueprint as well as publishing an annual report into the health of the NEM.\nImportantly, the Final Report also highlights that the level of commitment by the Federal, State and Territory governments to the existing Australia Energy Market Agreement (AEMA) has waned. It suggests that a new AEMA be agreed to in order to refocus and reaffirm the Federal, State and Territory governments' commitment to a national energy and emissions reduction policy. Whether such a commitment is politically realistic in the current environment remains to be seen.\nCompetition + Regulation\nJeremy Jose\nSimon Muys\nContact Simon\nChristopher Flynn\nContact Christopher\nLuke Woodward\nContact Luke\nJennifer Barron\nGeoff Petersen\nContact Geoff\nSmart Counsel\nA one-stop shop for the most frequently asked legal questions by in-house counsel, providing expert tips, example clauses and usage guides."}

{"text":"Energy, Transport & Urban Development~, Geopolitics & Multipolarity~\nChina produces three and a half times more solar capacity than the US\nThe world is adopting renewable energy at an unprecedented pace, and solar power is the energy source leading the way.\nDespite a 4.5% fall in global energy demand in 2020, renewable energy technologies showed promising progress. While the growth in renewables was strong across the board, solar power led from the front with 127 gigawatts installed in 2020, its largest-ever annual capacity expansion.\nThe Solar Power Leaderboard\nFrom the Americas to Oceania, countries in virtually every continent (except Antarctica) added more solar to their mix last year. Below is a snapshot of solar power capacity by country at the beginning of 2021. Data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows solar power capacity by top 10 countries in 2021. This includes both solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power capacity.\nChina is the undisputed leader in solar installations, with over 35% of global capacity. What's more, the country is showing no signs of slowing down. It has the world's largest wind and solar project in the pipeline, which could add another 400,000MW to its clean energy capacity.\nFollowing China from afar is the U.S., which recently surpassed 100,000MW of solar power capacity after installing another 50,000MW in the first three months of 2021. Annual solar growth in the U.S. has averaged an impressive 42% over the last decade. Policies like the solar investment tax credit, which offers a 26% tax credit on residential and commercial solar systems, have helped propel the industry forward.\nAlthough Australia hosts a fraction of China's solar capacity, it tops the per capita rankings due to its relatively low population of 26 million people. The Australian continent receives the highest amount of solar radiation of any continent, and over 30% of Australian households now have rooftop solar PV systems.\nThree Gorges Dam Co will develop three of China's planned new 100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower projects, two in China's sunny Qinghai province, teaming up with new private CSP developer Shouhang in one of these, and one in Gansu Province.\nChina: The Solar Champion\nIn 2020, President Xi Jinping stated that China aims to be carbon neutral by 2060, and the country is taking steps to get there.\nHuanghe Hydropower Hainan Solar Park, 2.2GW- China\nChina is a leader in the solar industry, and it seems to have cracked the code for the entire solar supply chain. In 2019, Chinese firms produced 66% of the world's polysilicon, the initial building block of silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) panels. Furthermore, more than three-quarters of solar cells came from China, along with 72% of the world's PV panels.\nWith that said, it's no surprise that 5 of the world's 10 largest solar parks are in China, and it will likely continue to build more as it transitions to carbon neutrality.\nWhat's Driving the Rush for Solar Power?\nThe energy transition is a major factor in the rise of renewables, but solar's growth is partly due to how cheap it has become over time. Solar energy costs have fallen exponentially over the last decade, and it's now the cheapest source of new energy generation.\nSince 2010, the cost of solar power has seen a 85% decrease, down from $0.28 to $0.04 per kWh. According to MIT researchers, economies of scale have been the single-largest factor in continuing the cost decline for the last decade. In other words, as the world installed and made more solar panels, production became cheaper and more efficient.\nThis year, solar costs are rising due to supply chain issues, but the rise is likely to be temporary as bottlenecks resolve.\nSource: Elements, November 15, 2021. https:\/\/elements.visualcapitalist.com\/mapped-solar-power-by-country-in-2021\/\n2 February 2022 admin\nPrevious Previous post: Fact-checking Western media reports on Beijing Winter Olympics\nNext Next post: World's largest solar powered Green Hydrogen plant begins operation in China"}

This recent exchange amongst the comments on a post about climate \"skepticism\" caught my eye because Dan Miller's explanation for the difficulty of communicating the climate crisis is so succinct.\nGordon Shephard said:\n\u2026 Ernest Becker, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his book \"The Denial of Death,\" argues that anxiety about one's mortality is (for the vast majority of people) the psyche's strongest motivator. It is not that people don't believe they are going to die, or that they fear death specifically, but that they hope that, somehow, their symbolic immortality will be assured as long as their particular vision of the future of humanity persists. Tell someone that their particular version is doomed, and they will fight you tooth and nail.\nCertainly some individuals have conscious motives for \"sowing confusion.\" But many will feel (unconsciously) that the possibility of a radical change in the course of humanity's future (such as that which will result from significant climate change) is a direct threat to their vision of their symbolic immortality. They will grasp the thinnest of straws just to say it isn't so.\nDan Miller replied:\nIn addition to the psychological resistance to a vision of a failed future, there are other psychological barriers to facing climate change.\nHumans evolved to filter information and focus on near-term dangers, like a lion approaching. There are six triggers that get us to focus on a problem: 1. Immediate, 2. Visible, 3. Historical Precedence, 4. Simple Causality, 5. Direct Personal Consequences, and 6. Caused by an Enemy. Until recently, climate change had 0 of 6 (you could now say that it is somewhat visible). Number 6 is an important one\u2026 imagine if we found out tomorrow that all the excess CO2 is being released by North Korea in order to destabilize the climate. We would take care of that swiftly!\nIt's almost as if the climate crisis was designed by a diabolical genius specifically so that we will not respond in time.

{"text":" atmosphere. (NASA's version is one of the simplest, clearest and most authoritative if you need to direct anyone to such a resource.) However, the scientific work continues to improve our knowledge every year. Two significant recent publications are discussed in not-too-technical terms in two highly regarded blogs, RealClimate and ThinkProgress.\nShould we trust the bloggers? These bloggers, yes. Stefan Rahmstorf, who discusses Marcott's paper in Science, teaches physics of the oceans as a professor at Potsdam University, is a member of the Advisory Council on Global Change of the German government and is a lead author of the paleoclimate chapter of the 4th assessment report of the IPCC. Joe Romm, who discusses Hansen's paper, worked at the highest levels of the US Department of Energy in the 1990s before moving into full-time environmental campaigning. (For more about them, see Wikipedia: Rahmstorf, Romm.) From here on, this summary uses their words, drastically condensed; follow the links at the end for the full versions.\nMarcott study: The End of the Holocene\nby Stefan Rahmstorf\nRecently a group of researchers from Harvard and Oregon State University has published the first global temperature reconstruction for the last 11,000 years \u2013 that's the whole Holocene (Marcott et al. 2013). The results are striking.\nOver the last decades, numerous researchers have painstakingly collected, analyzed, dated, and calibrated many data series that allow us to reconstruct climate before the age of direct measurements. Such data come e.g. from sediment drilling in the deep sea, from corals, ice cores and other sources. Shaun Marcott and colleagues for the first time assembled 73 such data sets from around the world into a global temperature reconstruction for the Holocene [i.e. the 11,700 years since the last Ice Age].\nGlobal temperature reconstruction from proxy data by Marcott et al, Science 2013\nThe climate curve looks like a \"hump\". At the beginning of the Holocene global temperature increased, and subsequently it decreased again by 0.7 \u00b0 C over the past 5000 years. The well-known transition from the relatively warm Medieval into the \"little ice age\" turns out to be part of a much longer-term cooling, which ended abruptly with the rapid warming of the 20th Century. Within a hundred years, the cooling of the previous 5000 years was undone. (One result of this is, for example, that the famous iceman '\u00d6tzi', who disappeared under ice 5000 years ago, reappeared in 1991.)\nThe curve of Marcott et al. will not be the last word on the global temperature history during the Holocene; like Mann et al. in 1998 [the famous \"Hockey Stick\" which was a similar temperature record for the last 1,000 years] it is the opening of the scientific discussion. There will certainly be some corrections and improvements. However, I believe that (as was the case with Mann et al.) the basic shape will prove correct: a relatively smooth curve with slow cooling trend lasting millennia from the Holocene optimum to the \"little ice age\", mainly driven by the orbital cycles. At the end this cooling trend is abruptly reversed by the modern anthropogenic warming. \u2026\nJust looking at the known drivers [factors affecting climate change] and the actual temperature history shows it directly, without need for a climate model: without the increase in greenhouse gases caused by humans, the slow cooling trend would have continued. Thus virtually the entire warming of the 20th Century is due to man. This May, for the first time in at least a million years, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has exceeded the threshold of 400 ppm. If we do not stop this trend very soon, we will not recognize our Earth by the end of this century.\nHansen study: Climate Sensitivity is High, Burning All Fossil Fuels Would Make Most of Planet 'Uninhabitable'\nby Joe Romm, Sept 17, 2013\nJames Hansen, the country's most prescient climatologist, is out with another must-read paper, \"Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide,\" \u2026 co-authored by a number of Hansen's former colleagues at NASA. \u2026 The key findings are:\n\u2022 The Earth's actual sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 levels from preindustrial levels (to 550 ppm) \u2014 including slow feedbacks \u2014 is likely to be larger than 3\u20134\u00b0C (5.4-7.2\u00b0F).\n\u2022 Given that we are headed towards a tripling (820 ppm) or quadrupling (1100 ppm) of atmospheric CO2 levels, inaction is untenable.\n\u2022 \"Burning all fossil fuels\" would warm land areas on average about 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) and warm the poles a stunning 30\u00b0C (54\u00b0F). This \"would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to"}
{"text":" climate change.\"\nBurning all or even most fossil fuels would be a true scorched Earth policy.\nGiven that James Hansen has been right about global warming for more than 3 decades, his climate warnings need to be taken seriously. [The] whole paper is worth reading. The authors conclude:\nMost of the remaining fossil fuel carbon is in coal and unconventional oil and gas. Thus, it seems, humanity stands at a fork in the road. As conventional oil and gas are depleted, will we move to carbon-free energy and efficiency\u2014or to unconventional fossil fuels and coal?\nIf fossil fuels were made to pay their costs to society, costs of pollution and climate change, carbon-free alternatives might supplant fossil fuels over a period of decades. However, if governments force the public to bear the external costs and even subsidize fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to continue to grow, with deleterious consequences for young people and future generations.\nIt seems implausible that humanity will not alter its energy course as consequences of burning all fossil fuels become clearer. Yet strong evidence about the dangers of human-made climate change have so far had little effect. Whether governments continue to be so foolhardy as to allow or encourage development of all fossil fuels may determine the fate of humanity.\nThat's the end of my quote from Romm's blog, and now you know the considered opinion of the experts. But we will be all right here in Oz, of course:\nRealclimate post on Marcott: http:\/\/www.realclimate.org\/index.php\/archives\/2013\/09\/paleoclimate-the-end-of-the-holocene\/\nMarcott's paper on Science: http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/339\/6124\/1198.abstract\nScience 8 March 2013\nA Reconstruction of Regional and Global Temperature for the Past 11,300 Years\nShaun A.

Climate, they say, is what you expect, while weather is what you get. But if climate is changing, how do we know what to expect?\nThat may sound flippant but it has become quite a serious question in climate science circles of late, for two reasons: communicating climate science to the public, and dealing with the statistical problem of defining a moving target.\nOn the first question, for instance, we have a typical member of the public asking on the RealClimate open thread, \"One thing that has confused me is how long it takes for weather to become climate.\"\nOne of the regulars replied: \"WMO (World Meteorological Organization) states that climate is 30 or more years of weather data.\" Another backed him up, saying, \"The traditional answer is 30 years or thereabouts.\" 'SecularAnimist', another regular, answered at greater length:\nI think this question is increasingly irrelevant, and the \"traditional\" answer is becoming obsolete.\nThe question was relevant when we were asking whether the various atmospheric conditions, processes, events and patterns of events that comprise \"climate\" are in fact changing, and wanted to know over what length of time we'd need to observe those phenomena as ever-changing, short term \"weather\" to be able to conclude that the changes are sufficiently long-term to be considered \"climate\" change. But we already know that the climate is changing, and will continue to change, as a result of our CO2 emissions. We don't need 30 more years of observations to tell us that, now.\nAnd the \"traditional\" answer is obsolete because it presumes that the Earth's climate is sufficiently stable, and changing so slowly, that it really does take 30 or more years of observations to detect any long-term, large-scale change. That's no longer the case, because the climate system is being driven to change more rapidly and extremely than it has ever done in human history. It's unlikely to take another 30 years for the American midwest to become desert. It's unlikely to take another 30 years for the Arctic sea ice to disappear completely during summer \u2014 with all of the prodigious effects that implies.\nThere is every reason to expect that permanent, large-scale, dramatic changes, which cannot reasonably be called anything but \"climate change\", may now occur on time scales of a few years, rather than a few decades, as would have been expected in the pre-AGW world.\nThe more technical problem with the definition of climate is that weather needs to be averaged over"}
{"text":" enough annual cycles to iron out the bumps caused by specific weather events (that's where the '30 years' comes from) but if, for instance, the averages of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s are successively quite different from each other then a 'climate' defined by the 1980-2010 average becomes meaningless.\nShould we just average over a shorter period, then? No, because known multi-year cycles such as El Nino will distort the result too much. As far as I know, the experts are still working out what to do about that. Meanwhile they tend to define our baseline climate by the period from 1951-1980. James Hansen, whom I have mentioned before, presents the reasons very sensibly in a very recent discussion of his recent 'climate dice' paper:\nStudies of climate change generally use some base period to define an average climate and calculate \"anomalies\" relative to that average, i.e., climate anomalies are the deviations from that average climate. In our papers we used 1951-1980 as the base period.\nGlobal temperature change over the past century (Fig. 1) helps us discuss possible effects of the choice of base period. Our choice of 1951-1980 as a base period has several merits:\n1) The period 1951-1980 is prior to the large warming of the past few decades. If we wish to examine the effect of that global warming on climate, we must compare with the climate that existed prior to that warming.\n2) The 1951-1980 period has the best global data coverage and can best characterize climate variability. Spatial coverage of data was poorer at earlier times.\n3) 1951-1980 was the base period used by the National Weather Service and other researchers when we made our first analyses of observations and climate simulations. For comparison with these early analyses and climate simulations we should use the same base period.\n4) Many of today's adults, baby-boomers, grew up during 1951-1980, so it is recent enough for many people to remember what the climate was like.\nThe whole discussion is well worth reading, since it presents the key findings of the longer and more technical paper in a very approachable way.

{"text":"\\section{Introduction}\nConventional district heating (DH) systems are a combination of heat from recycled sources (combined heat and power generation, waste to energy plants and industrial processes) and renewable sources such as biomass fuels and solar collectors (\\cite{werner2017international}). The conventional wisdom is that heat is collected or produced locally and distributed to customers in a citywide distribution network (\\cite{lygnerud2018challenges}). The most recent technological development is the usage of local, low temperature heat sources stemming from city infrastructure such as metro systems and sewage and commercial activity from sources such as data centres (\\cite{lygnerud2019contracts}). Low temperature heat recovery is referred to as 4th and 5th generation district heating technology where the 5th generation represents lower distribution temperatures than the 4th. The technology shift is, at present, new and far from established. However, utilisation of urban heat sources will become increasingly important in a future with no fossil fuels, lower available volumes of waste to incinerate and demand for alternative uses of biofuels. This presents an opportunity since such sources are numerous and tend to be situated close to urban areas of high heat demand; aspects that reinforce the resilience of the energy system overall. \\par\n \nThe combination of industrial and urban waste heat sources provides great potential for the replacement of fossil fuel based heating in Europe and globally. The global extent of waste heat recovery from industrial sources is not known. However, it is estimated that, in 2014, 331 PJ of industrial heat was recovered, whilst 16 PJ was recovered in Sweden. The potential for industrial heat recovery in district heating systems has been estimated for the UK (\\cite{mckenna2010spatial}), Spain (\\cite{miro2016methodologies}), Germany (\\cite{miro2016methodologies, bruckner2014using}), China (\\cite{fang2015key, li2016case}) and the EU as a whole (\\cite{connolly2013heat}). The potentials are high but, in all cases, there is a significant risk that the industrial waste heat provider will cease to operate (\\cite{werner2017international}). \\par\n\nAround 2.7 EJ\/year of industrial waste heat is estimated to be available in Europe. Additionally, around 1.2 EJ\/year of low temperature heat is available from data centres, metro stations, waste water treatment plants and service sector buildings (\\cite{lygnerud2019contracts}). For context, the EU's total demand for domestic heat and hot water is estimated at 10.7 EJ\/year (\\cite{persson2018accessible}). Despite the great potential for urban waste heat recovery, uptake has, so far, been low. Research has shown that urban waste heat recovery investment is hindered by untested technical solutions, the absence of standardised contracts and the current cost of carbon, making the business model more appropriate for circumstances beyond 2050 (\\cite{lygnerud2019contracts}). \\par\n\nThis paper was written from the perspective of the ReUseHeat project, funded by the European Commission. The project demonstrates four system innovations for recovering urban waste heat and conducts research into stakeholder perspectives, investment risks, requirements of investors and business models. The project is a forerunner in terms of low temperature waste heat recovery and showcases what the district heating sector may look like in 2050. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of policy in encouraging urban waste heat recovery for the heating and cooling sector in Europe.  \\par\n\n\\section{Literature review} \\label{section:literature_review}\n\\subsection{Heat market overview}\nIn the EU, district heating has an overall 13 percent market share of the heating sector.  However, in some markets, there is a longer tradition and the market is more mature.  District heating contributes to over 50 percent of heat demand in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (\\cite{werner2017international}). In terms of absolute numbers, however, the biggest district heating markets in the EU can be found in Germany and Poland (\\cite{ECOHEAT4EU}). In Germany, the prevalence of district heating is higher in eastern states (approximately 30 percent) than in western states (around 9 percent) (\\cite{ECOHEAT4EU}). The European district energy landscape can be split into four categories: consolidation countries, refurbishment countries, expansion countries and new developing countries (\\cite{aronsson2011existing}). \\par\n\n\\subsection{EU frameworks that impact district heating}\nFrameworks that impact the implementation of district energy in the EU originate both from EU directives and national legislation.  Legal frameworks for district heating differ significantly between regions and countries. Laws explicitly targeting district heating are in place in Denmark, Sweden, Norway"}
{"text":", Lithuania and Germany. In other countries, such as Finland, France, the UK and the USA, energy and competition laws dominate and apply to district energy markets (\\cite{werner2017international}). \\par\n\nIn 2016, the European Commission drafted a strategy for district heating and cooling which, among other things, aims to better integrate it with the electricity system. Further, the strategy aims to reduce energy waste in industry by utilising waste heat in district heating systems (\\cite{lygnerud2019contracts}). However, the strategy is not currently implemented across the European Union in a structure that resembles the directive. In a study of 14 EU countries (\\cite{aronsson2011existing}), directives with an impact on district energy have been identified. These are:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2002\/91\/EC on the energy performance of buildings.\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2004\/8\/EC on the promotion of cogeneration, based on useful heat demand in the internal energy market, amending Directive 92\/42\/EEC.\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2006\/32\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and Energy Efficiency Directive 2012\/12\/EU.\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2008\/1\/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC).\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2008\/98\/EC of the European Parliament on waste and repealing certain Directives.\n\\item European Parliament Directive 2009\/28\/EC of the European Parliament on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nDifferent countries within the EU have different traditions towards regulation. Below, countries adhering to the tradition of explicit heat regulation and those adhering to broader energy and competition regulation are discussed. At the end of the section, lessons that can be learned from these examples are discussed. \\par\n\n\\subsection{Countries with explicit heat regulations}\nTwo examples of countries with explicit heat regulations and mature heat markets are now discussed (Denmark and Sweden). Both countries have explicit heat regulation whilst one market is regulated (Denmark) and the other is privatised (Sweden). \\par \n\n\\subsubsection{Denmark}\nIn Denmark, there are several measures in place that support district heating.  These are (i) heat planning regulation, (ii) taxation, (iii) subsidies, (iv) heat price regulation, (v) CHP requirements, (v) a ban on electrical heating and (vi) a law on district cooling. There is a tradition of encouraging efficient use of energy by ensuring there is a market for collective heat supply. This is achieved through heat planning regulation. This planning also encompasses planning for the usage of waste. Taxation is applied on energy as a fuel and on its emissions, promoting a shift from fossil fuels. Before the millennium, there were different, direct subsidies impacting district heating usage (such as subsidies for converting older houses to DH, speeding up the process of planned networks and conversion from coal to gas). The heat price is regulated to reflect the actual cost. The idea is to outweigh the disadvantage to consumers of the natural monopolies that come from district heating ventures. The current electricity act stipulates that CHPs are built with the main ambition of generating electricity. However, heat recovery from CHPs is mandatory. A ban on electric heating in buildings also encourages DH. The last support mechanism for DH is that there is law that allows municipalities to operate commercial district cooling schemes using the same infrastructure as for DH (\\cite{aronsson2011existing}). \\par\n\nIn Denmark, in March 2012, parliament agreed on a 2020 climate strategy and to a long-term target to reach 100 percent renewable energy in the energy system by 2050. In 2018, the Danish government signed a new energy agreement with the support of all sitting parties in parliament reaffirming and strengthening Denmark's climate and energy goals leading up to 2030. The energy agreement contains a wide range of ambitious green initiatives. Companies and consumers will, in the upcoming years, receive cheaper heating through a modernisation of the heating sector, where both the district heating sector and consumers will have a free choice to decide on future investments.  This will result in cheap heating both for companies and consumers (\\cite{tian2019large}). Since the Danish government imposes an energy tax on natural gas, solar district heating plants are given the opportunity to compete with natural gas boilers. Consequently, solar district heating plants are commercially viable solutions in Danish district energy systems (\\cite{tian2019large}). Taking the interest of low temperature district heating investments into account, it is noted that, in Denmark, the 4DH research centre was active between 2012 and 2018 with contributions from several Danish and international universities, together with many Danish district heating and companies. Researchers within this centre have written a 4GDH definition paper (\\c"}
{"text":"ite{lund20144th}) and a 4GDH status paper (\\cite{lund2018status}). Many papers have also been published in scientific journals from the annual international 4DH conferences since 2015 (\\cite{lund2019perspectives}). Other than this initiative, however, there are no dedicated low temperature district heating incentive in place. \\par\n\n\\subsubsection{Sweden}\nWith the support of energy and climate policy, district heating systems have been developed since the 1970's and transformed from a dependence on fossil fuels to biomass. This progression has resulted in the DH sector being almost fossil free (\\cite{lygnerud2018challenges}). Sweden, for example, has the largest percentage of industrial heat recovery in its district heating systems in the world \\cite{lygnerud2017risk}.  An energy and carbon tax was introduced on fuels used in heat production in 1991. From 2008 onwards, the carbon tax was gradually phased out for those combustion plants covered by the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), in order not to interfere with this policy. Two governmental investment grant schemes (1991-1996 and 1997-2002) played an important role in the construction phase of biomass-based CHPs. A scheme for Tradable Renewable Electricity Certificates (TRC) was introduced in 2003 in order to support electricity from renewable energy sources and peat. This led to additional CHP production and, consequently, a shift from fossil fuels to biomass in CHP plants (\\cite{bouchikhi2003escaping,brange2016prosumers}). \\par\n\nIn 1996, the Swedish heat market was deregulated. Prior to this, the largest challenge to the district heating industry was to improve its production technology to meet the increasing demand (\\cite{lygnerud2006value}), but, since 1996, the industry has had to cope with challenges beyond technology. Examples of institutional challenges are a new district heating law (2008), the threat of price regulation (2009) and third party access (2009).  The Energy Efficiency Plan 2011 and the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012\/12\/EU (also known as EED) promote effective heat recovery systems from electricity and industrial production processes as a way to help reach the EU target. The national proposal for the implementation of the EED in Sweden states that a cost-benefit analysis should be performed to evaluate investments in the use of excess heat in comparison with other thermal supply systems (\\cite{energisverige}). The Swedish government bill states that a DH company has no obligation to allow regulated access ``if it can show that there is a risk that it will suffer damage as a result of the access''. This means that Swedish policy currently neither promotes nor advises against using excess heat recovery in DH (\\cite{energisverige}). On December 4th, 2019 it was announced that new legislation placing a tax on waste incineration will be introduced from April 1st, 2020. In combination with the new tax, the energy and $C0_{2}$ tax on CHP in will increase from 30 percent to 100 percent and 11 percent to 91 percent respectively. These new taxes will be a challenge to Swedish CHPs. Taking the interests of low temperature district heating investments into account, it is noted that no regulation explicitly supporting such investments exists in Sweden (\\cite{reuseheat_2_1}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Countries with energy and competition law regulation}\nGermany, France and the UK are examples of countries with energy and competition law regulation.  Out of these, Germany is a mature market, France has had a district heating market for a long time which is currently experiencing significant expansion and the UK is a new district heating market. Each of these countries are now discussed.\n\n\\subsubsection{Germany}\nThe district-heating sector in Germany has a 14 percent market share of the heating market. Electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks are regulated in German Energy Law but no such regulation exists for district heating; instead general rules of German competition law apply. Third party access to district-heating distribution grids is allowed but, at present, this has not been done to in any major extent.  The German government has put an emphasis on Combined Heat and Power and District Heating and Cooling as solutions for meeting environmental targets. A Combined Heat and Power Act (KWKModG) is planned to contribute to the objective of reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions. The Act also serves as the implementation of Directive 2004\/8\/EC on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market (Cogeneration Directive). The system shares some similarities with the Act on Granting Priority to Renewable Energy Sources (EEG) (\\cite{ECOHEAT4EU}). \\par\n\nIn Germany, the W{\\\"a}rmenetzsysteme 4.0 initiative has provided 100"}
{"text":" million euro for funding feasibility studies and pilot projects related to low temperature heat recovery 4GDH. \\par\n\n\\subsubsection{United Kingdom}\nA key initiative in England and Wales is the Heat Network Delivery Unit (HNDU), which was formed within the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in summer 2013 (\\cite{sneum2018policy}) to help meet 2050 targets. The Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) is a mandatory scheme that aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce $CO_{2}$. Eligible organisations must buy allowances to cover their reported emissions; hence, green DH investments have benefited from the scheme. Another mechanism with which to meet the 2050 goal is national and regional planning for infrastructure. The plans set the policy framework for infrastructure decisions (including heating infrastructure) through Planning Policy Statements (PPS). District heating plays a part in this scheme. These statements are combined with the Climate Change Levy (CCL) tax which taxes supplies of energy within the non-domestic sector including industry, commerce and the public sector. In the CCL, there are exemptions for fuel inputs and energy outputs from CHPs. \\par \n\nAn Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECA) scheme provides businesses with enhanced tax relief for investments in equipment that meet published energy-saving criteria. Eligibility for an ECA is a fiscal benefit available to new CHP schemes certified under the CHPQA programme. Since the most capital intensive element of distribution networks (the pipes) are not included, the scheme has limited overall effect in this sector. A number of funding programmes have been carried out in UK. These include both grant capital support and assistance with pre-investment activities. One example is the Community Energy programme that aims to deliver new community heating schemes and refurbish old ones, thus reducing carbon emissions, alleviating fuel poverty and reducing frontline energy costs. Another similar scheme was provided through the Homes and Communities Agency (\\cite{aronsson2011existing}). \\par\n\nThe government is progressing policy incentives that will reduce the heat demand of the existing building stock while promoting the uptake of renewable heating technologies. The recently deployed Green Deal is expected to remove the barrier of initial costs for energy efficiency improvements while the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) attempts to support market roll out of renewable heat technologies. However, the success of these policy initiatives is uncertain and the impacts on technology deployment are yet to be identified (\\cite{ziemele2016effect}). The need for district energy market regulation has been discussed but, to date, there is no regulation of the heat market (\\cite{sneum2018policy}). Taking the interest of low temperature district heating investments into account, it is notable that no regulation explicitly supporting such investments exists in the UK (\\cite{reuseheat_2_1}). \\par\n\n\\subsubsection{France} \nA large proportion of the supply of primary energy in France comes from nuclear power (\\cite{percebois2012quel}). Use of renewables such as hydropower, wind and solar is growing, however. France is increasingly focusing on energy savings and the reduction of waste. The Grenelle laws focus on decreasing energy consumption in buildings. However, the use of central heating (\\cite{belaid2016understanding}) makes the incentives blunt. France also offers tax credits for energy-efficient goods and zero-rate loans for energy efficiency renovations up to EUR 30,000 per dwelling.  The government has implemented energy performance contracts to be set up between owners and operators, establishing an energy efficiency target for a building.  Such contracts are increasingly considered by local authorities (\\cite{eshien2013contrats}). \n\nThere are two direct support measures for DH in France. The first one is reduced VAT (from 20 to 5.5 percent) for thermal heat delivery through DH systems. France also has a heat fund for heat from renewable sources (biomass, geothermal, biogas, PV). The idea is to provide incentives for increased shares of renewables in the fuel mix. Taking low temperature district heating investments into account, it is noted that no regulation explicitly supporting such investments exists in France (\\cite{reuseheat_2_1}).\n\n\\subsection{Lessons learned}\nDistrict heating is widely acknowledged for its contribution to 2050 targets. Price regulation of heat has been implemented (Denmark) or discussed (Sweden) in two markets with explicit DH legislation. All five countries have put taxation in place to directly or indirectly support DH.  In two of the five countries, there is explicit support for low temperature heat recovery (Denmark and Germany). These conclusions are summarised in table~\\ref{table:regulations} below. \\par\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\fontsize{6}{6}\n\\selectfont\n\\label{table:regulations}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l"}

A total of 76 respondents took part in the study and one major conclusion was that waste heat (both industrial and low temperature) is not explicitly mentioned in existing support schemes for DH. Since there are explicit incentives for different forms of renewables, a competition between DH with waste heat and DH with renewables emerges. This is an unfortunate situation that brings us back to the purpose of this paper, that is to discuss the role of policy in future proofing the heating and cooling sector in Europe, by allowing urban waste heat recovery. \\par\n\n\n\n\\section{Methodology}\nThe results in this paper derive from a number of sources described below\n\n\\subsection{Stakeholder Interviews}\nAn aim of the ReUseHeat project is to gather the views of various stakeholders and potential stakeholders of urban waste heat recovery.

{"text":" urban waste heat recovery in reaching 2050 targets}\nA number of `Roadmaps' have been designed defining options for achieving 2050 goals. An important example is the European Union Roadmap 2050 project which sets out pathways\nto achieve an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (\\cite{Roadmap_2050}). The Heat Roadmap Europe project (a series of commission funded projects mapping relevant heat sources for district heating) sets out approaches to the decarbonisation of the energy system in Europe. The examples provided in section~\\ref{section:literature_review} indicate that DH can support reaching these targets. This is further confirmed by other sources of information. In 2050, the cost of carbon will be higher than it is today, fossil fuels will not be available and the fuels that are currently used (such as waste and biofuels) will be increasingly scarce. It is then that urban waste heat recovery will become crucial and, possibly, a critical component for reaching the desired targets. \\par\n\n\\subsection{Creating awareness}\nA significant challenge for waste heat recovery is a low level of awareness about the potential opportunities that it presents, both for owners of excess heat and for those that may wish to exploit it. Well targeted government policy may be able to improve this situation. For historical reasons, the prevalence of district heating varies significantly around Europe and the wider world and this has an important impact on the level of awareness of the opportunities of waste heat recovery. Sweden is the country in the world with highest volumes of industrial waste heat recovered in district heating systems. Even so, the volumes recovered are modest in comparison to volumes available. There is awareness about the available potential and there is knowledge about barriers in the research community whereas the awareness about waste heat recovery appears to be lower amongst other stakeholder groups. \\par\n\nThe UK government has attempted to gauge awareness of waste heat recovery among businesses. A report published in 2016 found that awareness of waste heat recovery in the UK is mixed \\cite{Barriers_enablers}. Companies whose energy costs were relatively high tended to have significant interest in energy efficiency measures and most had a good awareness of waste heat recovery. Among companies with relatively low energy costs, most of which were smaller, awareness of waste heat recovery tended to be low. \\par\n\nIn a study of Swedish industrial waste heat recovery from 1974 onwards, it was found that large collaborations tended to be more viable than small ones. Collaborations involving recovery of large volumes typically had a longer lifespan than those involving low volumes (\\cite{lygnerud2017risk}). It seems likely that the nature of low temperature heat recovery means that businesses are less likely to consider the idea without being prompt. It is perhaps intuitive that high temperature waste heat from, for example, heavy industry may have some value and that there ought to be some way of using it to increase the overall efficiency. The operator of a waste water treatment plant, on the other hand, is unlikely to be intuitively aware that their waste heat is worth anything at all. Increasing awareness for lower temperature heat sources may therefore be a bigger challenge. Despite this, one study on low temperature district heating business model development (\\cite{lygnerud2018challenges}) shows that it is often the owner of the low temperature waste heat that approaches the district heating company asking for their support to make use of the waste heat generated. Again, in conclusion, urban waste heat recovery solution is seen as a future proof solution and to achieve a greater uptake, awareness of its potential is imperative. \\par\n\n\\subsection{Capacity building}\nLow temperature waste heat recovery is in its infancy as a technology and its prevalence is low. Currently, there are a number of barriers and government intervention may be required to break them down. Whilst few measures are in place targeting waste heat recovery specifically, there are proven government measures that can help in the context of low temperature district heating. Examples are direct incentives such as tax breaks and investment subsidies. Other measures directly targeting urban waste heat sources are either voluntary, such as pilot projects, or mandatory, such as obligations to make use of urban waste heat whenever generated. Implementation of urban waste heat recovery is, at present, predominantly undertaken in the form of pilot studies. In an ongoing project for the International Energy Association, more than 150 low temperature heat recovery pilot sites have been identified. The advantage of pilot sites is that they provide data on operations and risk which act as important inputs for potential investors. Formal assessment of the impact of a measure is crucially important to determining its effectiveness. Ideally, impact assessments should be performed before the measures are put in place and followed up once the policy is implemented. This can be done with mathematical models alongside risk assessment such as sensitivity analysis and Scenario Analysis. An important consideration is that different measures may interact with each other and therefore should be treated as part of a tree of decisions, rather than one stand alone decision. \\par\n\nThe European Union's `Better Regulation' initiative performs impact assessments on"}
{"text":" proposed laws that are expected to have economic, social or environmental impacts (\\cite{Better_regulation}). In addition, consultations with stakeholders and citizens are recommended. The EU commission also looks for areas of improvement in existing law. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are an important aspect of impact assessments, helping to quantify the performance of each measure. Often, multiple KPIs create trade offs. Perhaps the most prominent of these concerns a trade off between reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the overall cost of a project since a more `green' technology is often more expensive. A crucial target for government policy should therefore be to reverse this situation such that businesses are motivated to pursue green options. \\par\n\nThe European Commission is directly funding two large demonstration projects on low temperature heat recovery, in a total of 12 sites across Europe (for more information please consult the Reuseheat and Rewardheat projects). Limits on greenhouse gas emissions by regulation would benefit urban waste heat recovery technology. Such regulation can be directly linked to taxes aimed at the phasing out of fossil fuels. Examples of both exist, as discussed in the policy overview above (the EU-ETS system) along with energy carbon taxes. In such a context, it is important to note that there may be social aspects to consider when making planning decisions. For example, the cost of decarbonisation should not disproportionately be borne by the poorest in society. In some cases, governments may see measures as opportunities to achieve social aims by, for example, building infrastructure to provide cheaper heat, paid for with taxation (a dominant tradition in both Sweden and Denmark). To secure desirable and long term development in the DH industry, support for capacity building in urban waste heat recovery is needed. \\par\n\n\\subsection{What the investor wants}\nA question often asked is whether consumer preference can be changed by appeal to public good, in this case represented by low carbon solutions. Put simply, are consumers willing to accept higher prices for types of energy with a lower carbon footprint? Classical economic theory base would say ``no'', because this would be a distortion of the market. A ``yes'' would imply that there are issues other than price which affect decisions. In fact, there is some recent evidence that public good arguments can change behaviour such as the successful recent campaigns to curtail the use of plastic bags. Such campaigns, however, may not be enough to solve the problems as it may be hard to lay the moral issues at the consumers' door. \\par\n\nIn general, consumers tend to value causes in which they can `see' the impacts. The success of plastic bag campaigns has been the emotional reaction to stories of plastic pollution in the oceans, for example. In the context of waste heat recovery, it may be beneficial to emphasise the public good in a local context. The idea that locally sourced heat that would otherwise `go to waste' can be recovered and used instead of non renewables may be an appealing one. In some areas, this may create a demand for more expensive, but greener, heat. To reach 2050 goals, the nature of corporate governance must change from profit maximisation to climate optimisation. An obvious approach, introducing measures along these lines, is to `monetise' greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's carbon trading legislation, for example, places a monetary value on emissions, which can be traded at a cost, creating a financial incentive for reducing emissions. \\par\n\nThere have been some attempts to prioritise public good in investment decisions. For example, the UK Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which applies only to government contracts, states that decision makers ``should be taking a value for money approach - not lowest cost'' and should therefore take into consideration any (positive or negative) externalities for the local area (\\cite{Public_services}). At present, the act does not specify a value for the reduction of greenhouse emissions but this may be a valuable addition. \\par\n\nThe European Union has also pursued `socially responsible' policy on procurement. In 2011, its `Buying Social' publication set out an agenda for taking social elements into account when considering procurement bids (\\cite{european2010buying}). More recently, the EU have adopted reformed procurement rules that allow public authorities to take social elements into account when making procurement decisions. Guidance has been published, in the form of a ``Buying Green Handbook'', on how Green Public Procurement (GPP) can be implemented (\\cite{official2011buying}). Although green considerations are, at present, voluntary, the EC aims to achieve a critical mass of demand for sustainable goods and services. The above legislation is not yet linked up to corporate governance, and to do so would require a heavy shift in stance. Such requirements are a far easier sell for government contracts than for private enterprise in general. However, it is easy to see such rules applying to carbon emissions, and legal requirements for a net zero-carbon economy by 2050 may make such"}
{"text":" legislation necessary. \\par\n\nIn terms of policy, the most common approach is likely to be that which seeks to align the incentives of businesses and the public good. Taxes on carbon emissions, for example, attempt to make it financially advantageous for businesses to seek future proofed, low carbon alternatives. Policies that help reduce risk on environmentally friendly solutions should also be considered. For waste heat recovery, policy should be aimed at making it more financially viable than non-renewable alternatives. \\par\n\nSome forward looking financial institutions and companies have seen opportunities in investing in long term, low carbon, community based schemes.  One example is the collaboration between energy company Engie (France) and Axium that secured a 50 year Comprehensive Energy Management Contract with Ohio State University in the US in 2017. Another example is the collaboration between energy company VEKS (Denmark)and CP Kelco, a US-owned company that produces pectin, a natural starch. The company is located some 40 kilometres from Copenhagen and produces a large amount of excess heat. CP Kelco and VEKS have different business models. CP Kelco is an entirely commercial company and this means that, as a starting point, a large focus on investments with a short payback period is required. In contrast, VEKS, as an operator of infrastructure in the form of district heating systems, has a longer time horizon for its investments; VEKS works with more patient capital. An agreement was able to be reached due to clear system boundaries and a contract detailing payment schedules. CP Kelco was responsible for the investment and the design of the technical installations up to the \"connection point\" with VEKS. VEKS was responsible for the investments and the design of the technical installations from the \"connection point\" with CP Kelco and to the existing district heating network (meaning a larger investment for VEKS since about 150 meters of underground district heating piping was needed). In terms of payback, two time periods were established. In the first period of operation (3-4 years), CP Kelco received their payback and, in the second (some 4 years), the investment of VEKS was paid back.  \\par\n\nIt is useful to think of DHC funding as a special type of infrastructure spending. This has the advantage of making it part of the wider and current discussion, both nationally and internationally, about the need to renew infrastructure and its role as one particular mechanism to stimulate economies. Wider energy and transport infrastructure are similar examples. The common features are that a mixture of public and private funding is often preferred with the notion that companies are reluctant to invest unless initial investment, or at least a high proportion of it, is provided by the public sector. Lump sum grants, land grants, or grants tied to project milestones are more closely related to direct financing instruments; they reduce the need for privately-sourced capital expenditures for the project and can also reduce initial outlay. This has the effect of enhancing returns to investors and can also enhance creditworthiness and the viability of the financing structure. \\par\n\nA generic term describing the area is ``project risk capital'' or ``risk capital funding schemes''. Related to this is the growth of special funds such as green funds, often managed at the city level (see \\cite{MEEF,Goth_green_bonds} for example). A summary is that with (i) project, (ii) fund and (iii) institutional investors, there is a double effort: the fund needs to attract institutional investment and the project sponsors need to attract resources from the fund. The methodology also includes ``structuring'': matching the type of funding to the type of asset; in the case of DHC, this means long term funding. \\par\n\nIn view of the urgency of the 2050 objectives, the role of infrastructure and social value objectives (the latter being very relevant because many DHC projects are private-public partnerships), we are likely to see an increase in the requirement to cut carbon in all DHC contracts, with associated incentives. This is a win-win: increased incentives will improve the profitability of the relevant contracts for the private sector while, at the same time, directing investment into carbon-free technologies. An example would be tax incentives or cheap loans for domestic or community heat pumps. There are also important links between national and local schemes. For example, local heat storage can be used to store surplus renewable energy from the national grid such as from wind. \\par\n\nA common theme coming from interactions with investors expressing an interest in waste heat recovery is that, although there is a desire to invest and that money is available to do so, project promoters do not adequately assess the investment risk. In short, investors need to be more reassured that there is a high probability of receiving their money back than at present. \\par\n\nStakeholders in district energy need to manage different objectives, for example medium term lending horizons versus long term infrastructure investment. A conventional district heating network has a"}
{"text":" technical lifetime of approximately 40 years and the low temperature heat recovery investments have lifespans that are approximately half. The investors who are willing to lock in funds for decades are rare but as seen above there are ways to come around this parameter. \\par\n\nInvestors generally look for mature technologies with low degrees of legal, technological and economic risk. The track record, experience and financial strength of project partners is a key aspect in the decision to invest along with predictability and stability of cash flows and stability in the political framework. Talking to investors on immature district heating market of the UK it was identified that even conventional district energy technology was perceived as new and risky. There is a knowledge gap that needs to be bridged between district heating practitioners  and investors interested in green. This is the case both for conventional district heating ventures and for the newer, low temperature solutions. \\par\n\nThe concept of bankability, that is the extent to which a project is attractive to investors, must be part of a wider discussion of the risks of DHC projects. The risk analyses presented in business cases for funding should be close to those carried out by the potential funder. Stakeholders, however, need to manage different objectives, for example medium term lending horizons versus long term infrastructure investment. Technical risks arise from the novelty of projects, which feed off inventive sources of waste heat, and a lack of experience, which, itself, is a major source of risk. There is experience of waste heat recovery from data centres and sewers but not of, say, hidden underground rivers (\\cite{Lost_rivers}). \\par\n\nEven if the styles of risk analysis and the KPIs are shared between the funder and funded there remains some macro issues to be taken into account, most importantly zero carbon objectives and road maps. On the positive side, for some of these, we are all in the same boat, or in this case planet. The vehicle for trying to handle these larger scale issues is scenario analysis (SA) which has grown rapidly in the last few years particularly in the area of climate and energy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's IS92 comprised six scenarios which were followed by the \"Special Report on Emissions\" (SRES) and the ``Representative Concentrated Pathways'' (RCPs). \\par\n\nIt is becoming more common for mainstream risk methods to be supplemented with SA. This could be referred to as global sensitivity analysis as opposed to the simulation based local sensitivity analysis carried out on the spreadsheets of CAPEX and OPEX. Financial Institutions are familiar with this under the heading of the stress testing required by regulators. SA can be seen to fill, however roughly, the gap between local sensitivity, amenable to various statistical methods, and a less easily definable uncertainty about the future. All actual risk is predicted on particular scenarios. Some scenarios refer to future policies, such as tax incentives, whilst others may be contingent on events such as a sudden and unforeseen increase in electricity prices. \\par\n\nActual investment needs to checked against an agreed tapestry of scenarios. The agreement is that the investment needs to be robust, not just to local variation but against agreed scenarios, and the risk allocation made accordingly. The technical side of SA is a major research area but can at least be divided into various headings such as scenario design and scenario control and it is generally agreed to be a useful creative tool (\\cite{wheatcroft2019scenario}). \\par\n\nDHC itself is more closely related to climate scenarios, given the ``climate emergency''. This is likely to play a major role in the new accelerated agenda and the shared responsibility of cities and their funders ought to be a driver for investment, to add to the special incentives and stricter laws. \\par\n\nThe ReUseHeat project has favoured the use of modelling as a foundation for contracts and demand forecasting.  This extends to risk.  Cities need to improve understanding of the risk of a project, particularly to facilitate the route from feasibility studies to a business case.  The expertise that cities have may be less than that of financial institution but increased harmony between the risk methods would be valuable for bankability.  The contractors are experts at physical risk whereas the financial institutions are able to tier the financial risks and these are not the same thing. \\par\n\nGiven the increasing insecurity arising with climate change, it is noticeable how the use of scenarios has gathered strength.  The methodology of how to design and make use of scenarios is very much less developed than risk theory.  Despite this, energy companies and governments are working with them in order to supplement more formal risk analysis.  The kinds of local sensitivity analysis which are commonplace in dealing with risk based spreadsheets needs to be extended to robustness with respect to major scenarios. We have already seen this with wind power where rapid development is faster than predicted by forecasts.  Storage, both of electricity and heat is developing similarly quickly.  We feel that, rather than scenarios describing events which instil"}
{"text":" anxiety, it is important that they be presented as commercial opportunities.  Whilst waste heat recovery may be a more expensive option at present, future policies may reverse this situation and investing now may give companies a competitive advantage in the future.  There may also be other opportunities such as selling heat storage to the national grid to observe peak outputs of renewables.  Every data centre, metro system and canal is an opportunity to use heat pumps to provide heat.  \\par\n\n\n\\subsection{Legal Framework}\nThe lack of a systematic approach to regulation is a major, perhaps the biggest, impediment to investment in DHC, and to urban waste heat recovery in particular. Indeed, regulatory risk (also referred to as political risk) is usually included in risk analysis. A systematic approach to DHC should be part of a systematic approach to energy in general and the fact that low temperature DH consists of small local schemes does not aid integration. Local advantages may ignore negative externalities and national initiatives may ignore local DH, even to the extent that incentivising electricity may ignore heat and cooling, giving incentives for CHPs but not for heat pumps and waste heat recovery systems. It is very likely that this will be rectified when the importance of local DH to international roadmap objectives\nis realised. \\par\n\nAn example of where a broad brush approach at the national level ignores DHC is in the Third Party Access (TPA) directives. Another lack of clarity is that diseconomies of scale may make it costly to produce heat at a local scale, rather than on a larger scale. Thus, incentives may apply when a heat pump is domestic but may not be valid for larger heat pumps at a community scale, which may be more efficient. In many cases, excess heat is not properly recognised as a heat source and there are no incentives at all. This ought to change as its contribution to $CO_{2}$ reduction is properly recognised. DH is, at present, routinely ignored in the climate debate. This is surprising because the DHC system can use sources such as geothermal, biomass and solar energy. At a technical level, energy efficiency indicators for buildings should take into account total energy consumption rather than just primary fossil fuel. \\par\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Policy Implications}\nWe make three policy recommendations and these are described below:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\emph{Create awareness and a standardised legal framework so that DH can support the attainment of the 2050 goals.} \\\\\nThere is limited knowledge in Europe of the opportunities that waste heat recovery offers. Understanding of what the heating market might look like in 2050 is also limited. In 2050, there will almost certainly be no fossil fuels, alternative fuels for heat generation will be limited (waste and biofuels) and the cost of carbon will reflect the cost to the environment. Awareness about the future and options for heating needs to be created. With greater awareness, urban waste heat recovery will become a natural step towards future proofing the district energy sector. \\par\n\nThe low level of awareness of waste heat recovery is reflected by the absence of a legal framework. This makes contracting and investments complicated and time consuming.  The inclusion of waste heat (including urban waste heat) into the decarbonisation strategy of the EU would reduce the risk of competition between waste heat recovery and renewables. \\par\n\n\\item \\emph{Strengthen capability for undertaking urban waste heat recovery.}\n\\\\\nWe recommend that the implementation of pilot projects should be heavily supported by policy makers. Such projects allow for the technical and economic feasibility of waste heat recovery projects to be demonstrated in terms of how closely they replicate the planning stage. Strengthened capabilities in urban waste heat recovery generate both technical and non-technical knowledge which can be Incorporated into future projects, reducing the risk. The involvement of utility companies or other long term investors can be an advantage in terms of risk reduction. It is worth noting that pilot projects do not need to receive funding from public entities and may, instead, be funded by private companies if they are motivated to do so. \\par\n\n\\item \\emph{Bridge the gap between urban waste heat recovery projects and investors.}\n\\\\\nThere is a desire from decision makers in Europe to reach 2050 targets. This means that investors are typically interested in green projects. Urban waste heat recovery projects have a significant green value. Hence, from an economic point of view, there appears to be both supply of demand for green investments. Within the ReUseHeat projects, it has been found that low maturity of urban waste heat recovery investments requires support from the district heating community to make investors understand the business case, risk and the value of green. A possible approach to bridging the gap between urban waste heat recovery projects and investors was identified at the ReUseHeat policy workshop held in October 2019 in Brussels. A pilot credit facility is recommended, that covers some portion of the risk for waste heat recovery projects. The facility would have a total size of 20"}

The carbon offset project is part of NativeEnergy's Help Build scheme in which companies such as as Ebay, GreenMountain, Coffee Roasters, ClifBar and Aveda finance projects to help them get off the ground. The School will save a net of $1.7 million during the first 20 years of operation of the project.\n\"The wind turbine is a winning project all around. The school will utilize its own source of renewable energy, reduce our carbon footprint and have a hands-on learning facility. The project also contributes clean energy to the grid and corporate sponsors receive carbon credits to offset their unavoidable emissions,\" said Ron Green, the superintendent of the Shenandoah School Corporation.\nOther interesting facts about the new wind farm is that the emissions it prevents equals to the emissions of 30,000 barrels of crude oil or 1.5 million gallons of gasoline. Besides, the students will get an education on wind power technology.\nAn engineering and construction company from Indianapolis called Performance Services is in charge of the project.\nArticle by Antonio Pasolini, a Brazilian writer and video art curator based in London, UK.

A trio of researchers recently took a shot at that and conducted a study which tries to answer how profitable it is to recover metals from old electronics.\nIn 2016 alone, the world discarded 44.7 million metric tons of unusable or simply unwanted electronics, according to the United Nations' 2017 Global E-Waste Monitor report. That's 4,500 Eiffel Towers-worth of phones, laptops, microwaves, and TVs. Only 20 percent of this e-waste was properly recycled that year. The rest was likely either incinerated, pumping pollution into the atmosphere, or added to a landfill somewhere, with its toxins now leaking into our soil and water supply.\nIt turns out, urban mining costs much less than traditional mining. The researchers from Beijing's Tsinghua University and Sydney's Macquarie University published their results in a scientific journal after collecting data from recycling companies in China. While the cost of recycling might vary from country to country, China's status as the world's biggest producer of e-waste makes light of the truth that the practice of urban mining could have a big impact on both economic and environmental matters.\n[W]e already knew electronics contain precious metals in addition to all that glass and plastic. While a single smartphone might not contain all that much, consumers buy about 1.7 billion of the devices each year. In just one million of those, you'll find roughly 75 pounds of gold, 35,000 pounds of copper, and 772 pounds of silver.\nNecessary reminder though: this is no reason at all to justify our technological consumption practices. If anything, it should make us ask more conscientiously, what do I do with my smartphone once I find a new replacement that has great upgrades and loads informative online articles (like this!) much faster?\n--> Help make the world a better place by sharing this story with your friends:\nAuthor Nicholas LanePosted on March 28, 2019 Categories Business, Environment, Lifestyle, Science, TechnologyTags electronics, gadget, gadgets, laptop, mining, phone, profit, recycling, smartphone, urban mining, waste management, waste reduction\nGoodyear Rolls Out Moss Tire That Helps Clean Air\nLast year's greatest catalog expansion was not that of your favorite shoes or sunglasses, but wheels. Yes, commercial car tires got the ultimate makeover in 2017, introducing anti-flat and airless masterpieces. But manufacturers haven't run out of ideas yet, with Goodyear rolling out one of its most genius products yet. The rubber company is engineering a moss-covered tire that absorbs moisture and expels oxygen.\nGoodyear says if a Paris-sized city, with around 2.5 million vehicles, used Oxygene tires then it would eliminate 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year while also producing more than 3,000 tons of oxygen.\nWith 80% of people residing in areas with dangerously high pollution levels, the roads could use a breather. The Oxygene is 3D-printed, shock-absorbent, and immune to perforations. Michelin might have to step its game up.\nThe tire also \"harvests the energy generated during photosynthesis\" to power an assortment of onboard sensors and electronics including a sidewall light strip and an artificial intelligence processing unit. The tire also has V2V and V2X technology which allows it to warn other vehicles about lane changes and other maneuvers.\nYep \u2014 if my wheels could keep me on time, wash my laundry remotely, and call my sister, I'd throw em on the shopping list.\nAuthor Rachel MillerPosted on March 9, 2018 Categories Environment, Science, TechnologyTags 3D printing, air pollution, carbon dioxide, cars, clean air, electronics, gadgets, Goodyear, moss, oxygen, photosynthesis, sensor, tire, wheels\nPixel Buds Can Translate Conversations\nWhen Translate One2One launched back in June, it was the latest translation technology of its kind.

Sainsbury recently manufactured a smart label that reminds home cooks when to use up an ingredient. However, the labels are only for ham packets. Kitchen company Smarter hopes its newest device will be a game-changer. FridgeCam is an affordable refrigerator camera that helps users monitor food in real time.\nThe Smarter FridgeCam takes food \"selfies\" which are sent to the user's phone, allowing an instant reminder of what could be on the menu for their next meal. The app also monitors use-by dates, and issues automatic top-up reminders to buy more food products based on remaining quantities.\nWhy not use any camera? Well, for starters, I wouldn't recommend shoving a point-and-shoot into your fridge. Plus, it costs less than $150, which is a steal compared to full-on smart refrigerators.\n\"The supermarkets tell us that the way we shop has fundamentally changed. People are shopping little and often and using different shops. The more we developed and trialled this technology, the more we found that it could not just help reduce food waste but it also encourages people to shop in a smarter and more efficient way,\" [said Christian Lane, founder of Smarter]\nThe quirky gadget could help reduce the over-purchasing of food as well as encourage timely use.

If it can produce replacement limbs for animals and even mimic brain tissue, what can't it do? The answer is simple but equally as frustrating. 3D printing doesn't come cheap, nor is it very fast. But this metal 3D printer, which is 100 times quicker and costs 20 times less, could change that.\nDesktop Metal just developed a new metal 3D printer that is reportedly faster, safer and cheaper than existing systems.\nThe parts go into a \"de-binding bath\" that separates a substantial portion of the binding polymer. The parts then go into a sintering furnace. When the product is heated to just below the melting point, the binding agent burns off and a highly dense, sintered metal is produced.\nThe impressive gadget doesn't use metal powders or laser technology, making it safer to install. But the excitement doesn't stop there. It's reportedly better than NASA and Boeing's laser-melted printer.\nThe mass production system is built for speed and definitely delivers. It is faster than machining, casting, forging or other techniques, and each production printer can produce up to 500 cubic inches of complex parts per hour.\nThe entire system costs around $120,000, which is a steal compared to a $1 million laser machine. Desktop Metal is still taking baby steps, but I'm expecting nothing less than an explosion in the industry.\nAuthor Nicholas LanePosted on August 8, 2017 Categories Environment, TechnologyTags 3D printing, Boeing, gadgets, inventions, laser technology, metal, NASA\nMan Uses Game Boy To Photograph Jupiter\nPeople never fail to impress me.

Although these guidance estimates reflect the impact on the company's operating results of an assumed range of future disposition activity, these guidance estimates do not include any estimates of possible future gains or losses from possible future dispositions because the magnitude of gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties, if any, will depend on the sales price and depreciated cost basis of the disposed assets at the time of disposition, information that is not known at the time the company provides guidance, and the timing of any gain recognition will depend on the closing of the dispositions, information that is also not known at the time the company provides guidance and may occur after the relevant guidance period. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our assumed range of future disposition activity because any potential future disposition transactions will ultimately depend on the market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to the company's capital needs, the particular assets being sold and the company's ability to defer some or all of the taxable gain on the sales. These guidance estimates also do not include the impact on operating results from potential future acquisitions, possible capital markets activity, possible future impairment charges or any events outside of the company's control.

The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets)"}
{"text":" and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets. We also add back net income attributable to noncontrolling common units of the Operating Partnership because we report FFO attributable to common stockholders and common unitholders.\nWe believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs.\nImplicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide.\nHowever, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.\nReported amounts are attributable to common stockholders and common unitholders.\nFFO available to common stockholders and unitholders includes amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements of $4.7 million and $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $8.9 million and $13.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCalculated based on weighted average shares outstanding including participating share-based awards (i.e. certain time based restricted stock units) and assuming the exchange of all common limited partnership units outstanding.\nTyler Technologies Reports Earnings for Second Quarter 2021\nAMERISAFE Announces 2021 Second Quarter Results"}

The Portuguese state reorganized monetary relations in the empire-state with the help of a new legal framework. The aim of this imperial economic reorganization was to establish a balance of payment relations which was expected to facilitate Portugal's economic modernization and the country's association with liberalizing economies in Western Europe that were experiencing rapid economic growth. However, the escudo zone soon became dysfunctional. Mata explains why the designs of economy building in a Portuguese empire-state could not be realized, given the trend toward independent political and economic development in Lusophone Africa.\nOrganisational change and success in a government enterprise: Malaysia's Federal Land Development Agency\nMichael O'Donnell, Norma Binit Mansor, Kunaraguru Yogeesvaran, Azlan Rashid\nJournal: The Economic and Labour Relations Review \/ Volume 28 \/ Issue 2 \/ June 2017"}
{"text":"\nThis article charts and analyses the change path and various transformations of Malaysia's state-owned enterprise, the Federal Land Development Agency, from its establishment in the 1960s to the present. The analysis supports arguments that the model of the developmental state, based on planned public\/private cooperation, provides an alternative policy prescription to that of sole reliance on the self-regulating market. The Federal Land Development Agency is shown not only to have survived but also to have thrived as an economic development arm of the Malaysian state, successfully adapting to the changing environment in which it operates. To delineate the changes, a framework of punctuated equilibrium is utilised as it best captures the instances of rapid discontinuous change and the periods of incremental change and relative stability.\nUnderstanding women's empowerment in post-Covid Korea: A historical analysis\nHaeyoung Jang, Seung-Ho Kwon\nSouth Korea has been faced with a widening economic gender gap during the recent Covid-19 pandemic. To inform discussion of Korean women's future following the pandemic, this article explores the country's history of women's empowerment. It identifies cultural, educational, economic, and political changes, and their long-term effects on women's role and status. The analysis is based on data collected from Korea's national statistical database and a review of relevant literature. Findings inform policy directions for advancing women's economic empowerment in Korea and other countries following a similar development path and contribute to expanding our understanding of the factors and relations influencing women's empowerment.\nStructure and agency in the Malaysian government's policies for economic development\nMd Nasrudin Md Akhir, Keum Hyun Kim, Chung-Sok Suh\nJournal: The Economic and Labour Relations Review \/ Volume 24 \/ Issue 4 \/ December 2013\nThis article examines the role of government in Malaysia's history of economic development. In addressing two key challenges \u2013 inter-ethnic inequalities, conflicts and tensions, and exposure to global trade and economic relations \u2013 the Malaysian government has become directly involved in the economy. Strong government has played a role in Malaysia's economic success in a range of ways, from 5-year plans to specific industry promotion and the creation of organisations for particular economic development purposes. Government has also been aware of environmental changes and in response has modified its strategies, established new organisations and invested in innovative ventures. Thus, while the drivers of economic development in Malaysia have been deeply embedded structural phenomena, the actual economic development path taken has been determined by the actions of the Malaysian government in concert with other stakeholders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons on building more equal and sustainable societies\nKristin van Barneveld, Michael Quinlan, Peter Kriesler, Anne Junor, Fran Baum, Anis Chowdhury, PN (Raja) Junankar, Stephen Clibborn, Frances Flanagan, Chris F Wright, Sharon Friel, Joseph Halevi, Al Rainnie\nThis discussion paper by a group of scholars across the fields of health, economics and labour relations argues that COVID-19 is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis from which there can be no return to the 'old normal'. The pandemic's disastrous worldwide health impacts have been exacerbated by, and have compounded, the unsustainability of economic globalisation based on the neoliberal dismantling of state capabilities in favour of markets. Flow-on economic impacts have simultaneously created major supply and demand disruptions, and highlighted the growing within-country inequalities and precarity generated by neoliberal regimes of labour market regulation. Taking an Australian and international perspective, we examine these economic and labour market impacts, paying particular attention to differential impacts on First Nations people, developing countries, women, immigrants and young people. Evaluating policy responses in a political climate of national and international leadership very different from those in which major twentieth century crises were addressed, we argue the need for a national and international conversation to develop a new pathway out of crisis.\nWhy services cannot be the engine of growth for India\nChaitanya Talreja, Anirban Dasgupta\nJournal: The Economic and Labour Relations Review \/ Volume 33 \/ Issue 3 \/ September 2022\nIndia's phenomenal service-led growth in recent decades has generated debate on the role of services vis-\u00e0-vis manufacturing as the engine of growth. With the rapidly increasing importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in global production systems since the 1990s, there have been claims of services having developed a growth dynamism similar to manufacturing. This article examines the role of services in India's growth process using the concept of inter-sectoral linkages to make comparison with the role of manufacturing. Input-Output linkages and time series analysis reveal that services have been much less integrated in India's production structure than manufacturing. They were also less important in generating indirect employment spillovers through sectoral linkages, compared with manufacturing. Service sector growth is found to be autonomously driven by final demand and therefore less dependent on its interconnections with the rest of the economy from the production side. The findings also indicate that"}
{"text":" service sector growth has stimulated manufacturing growth but not vice versa. However, the impact of services on manufacturing from the demand-side is neither sustainable nor desirable going forward. India is in urgent need of strategically developing its manufacturing sector through integrating dynamic services like ICT and internalising productivity gains. At the same time measures to address India's inequality are critical to broaden the country's demand base and make the growth process more sustainable and inclusive. In this sense, inequality reduction is a prerequisite for growth and should not be seen as an alternative to it.\nA note on estimating income inequality across countries using PPP exchange rates\nJayati Ghosh\nJournal: The Economic and Labour Relations Review \/ Volume 29 \/ Issue 1 \/ March 2018\nThe use of exchange rates based on Purchasing Power Parities to compare incomes across countries and over time has now become standard practice. But there are reasons to believe that this could lead to excessively inflated incomes for poorer countries and in some cases also inflate the extent of real changes over time. Estimates of gross domestic product growth in the Chinese and Indian economies in recent years provide examples of this.\nGovernment policy and private sector development in post-conflict states: Growing Cambodia's rice production and export industries\nMark Turner, Ribaun Korm, Kim Veara\nThis article deals with the rehabilitation of economies in post-conflict states, paying particular attention to the role played by the state in this process. Using the example of Cambodia and its policies on rice production and export, the article shows the prominent role that may be played by the state in prioritised areas of economic development where there has been market failure. In the Cambodian case, the government targeted rice production and export as these had great potential for promoting the major aims of national development policy \u2013 economic growth and poverty alleviation. Using a whole-of-government approach and a combination of direct involvement and the creation of an enabling environment, the government appears to have contributed to vastly increased rice production and export.\n2 - Taking the Measure of Emerging East Asia\nCalla Wiemer, American Committee on Asian Economic Studies\nBook: Macroeconomics for Emerging East Asia\nPrint publication: 01 December 2022, pp 23-34\nThe economies of Emerging East Asia differ greatly with respect to size, level of development, engagement in international trade and finance, and the roles of state versus market. Yet, broadly speaking, a common framework for macroeconomic analysis applies even as particulars differ. Notably, all economies of the region must contend with shocks by instituting policy mechanisms aimed at maintaining balance. The economic features described in this chapter have a bearing on the particular forms these mechanisms take.\nMarket integration, income inequality, and kinship system among the Mosuo of China\nSiobh\u00e1n M. Mattison, Neil MacLaren, Chun-Yi Sum, Peter M. Mattison, Ruizhe Liu, Mary K. Shenk, Tami Blumenfield, Mingjie Su, Hui Li, Katherine Wander\nJournal: Evolutionary Human Sciences \/ Volume 5 \/ 2023\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press: 21 November 2022, e4\nIncreased access to defensible material wealth is hypothesised to escalate inequality. Market integration, which creates novel opportunities in cash economies, provides a means of testing this hypothesis. Using demographic data collected from 505 households among the matrilineal and patrilineal Mosuo in 2017, we test whether market integration is associated with increased material wealth, whether increased material wealth is associated with wealth inequality, and whether being in a matrilineal vs. patrilineal kinship system alters the relationship between wealth and inequality. We find evidence that market integration, measured as distance to the nearest source of tourism and primary source of household income, is associated with increased household income and'modern' asset value. Both village-level market integration and mean asset value were associated negatively, rather than positively, with inequality, contrary to predictions. Finally, income, modern wealth and inequality were higher in matrilineal communities that were located closer to the centre of tourism and where tourism has long provided a relatively stable source of income. However, we also observed exacerbated inequality with increasing farm animal value in patriliny. We conclude that the forces affecting wealth and inequality depend on local context and that the importance of local institutions is obscured by aggregate statistics drawn from modern nation states.\n3 - Electing Leaders with Hegemonic Aspirations\nLaura Gamboa\nBook: Resisting Backsliding\nPrint publication: 03 November 2022, pp 50-97\nThis chapter focuses on the first stage of the erosion of democracy.

{"text":", especially after 1953, when the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was reestablished following a CIA-sponsored coup. The chapter explores the tenuous beginnings of the reign of the new Shah, the increasing legislative and policy-making significance of the Majles in the 1940s, and the era of oil nationalization, from 1951 to 1953. Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq was successful in getting the powers of the monarchy to be significantly reduced, but his overthrow was followed by the restoration of absolute monarchy built on a massive army and a feared secret service called SAVAK. Ultimately, however, the Pahlavi state failed to incorporate within its orbit and its social base remained weak. As the oil revenues began to lag, and the state was forced into making \"housecleaning\" concessions, it began to crumble under the weight of the gathering storm.\n4 - The New Dynasty\nPrint publication: 25 August 2022, pp 60-86\nThis chapter examines the steady decline and ultimate collapse of the Qajar dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty. It examines the rise of the dynasty's founder, Reza Khan, and the social and political context within which the new monarch sought to implement a series of far-reaching social and cultural initiatives designed to modernize the country. A strong central state was established, local rebellions were put down, and various bureaucratic institution were founded in order to affect social change and foster economic development. New, modern schools proliferated across the country. But Reza Shah's reforms remained ultimately devoid of institutional support, and many were therefore abandoned or altogether reversed when he was removed from office by the British.\nA Dynastic History of Iran\nFrom the Qajars to the Pahlavis\nMehran Kamrava\nPrint publication: 25 August 2022\nThis rich dynastic study examines the political histories of Iran's last two monarchical dynasties, the Qajars and the Pahlavis. Tracing the rise and fall of both dynasties, Mehran Kamrava addresses essential questions about how and why they rose to power; what domestic and international forces impacted them; how they ruled; and how they met their end. Exploring over two hundred years of political history, Kamrava's comprehensive yet concise account places developments within relevant frameworks in an accessible manner. With detailed examinations of Iran's history, politics, and economics, he interrogates the complexities of dynastic rule in Iran and considers its enduring legacy. Developing innovative interpretations and utilizing original primary sources, this book illuminates the impact of the monarchy's rule and ultimate collapse on Iranian history, as well as Iran's subsequent politics and revolution.\nBy Sitta von Reden\nEdited by Sitta von Reden, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, Germany\nBook: The Cambridge Companion to the Ancient Greek Economy\nPrint publication: 04 August 2022, pp 1-12\nThe introduction sets out the chronological and geographical frame as well as the main issues in the study of the ancient Greek economy. It is targeted at a readership with no prior knowledge of the ancient economy and emphasises the importance of understanding economic structures, economic change, and the causes for change. As research on the ancient economy is dependent on theoretical assumptions about the nature and causation of economic change, a special section of the Companion is devoted to the discussion of the most important theoretical approaches to the ancient Greek economy. Other sections treat key themes of the ancient Greek economy, such as taxation, money, markets and labour regimes, as well as network approaches that are currently at the centre of research on ancient economies. A chronologically narrow but geographically wide perspective is taken on the Greek economy, including the Hellenistic economies in Egypt and the Near East but excluding Greek economies in the western Mediterranean and those in the eastern Mediterranean that continued to be dominated by Greek language and culture and therefore still might be termed Greek under the Roman Empire.\n9 - China's Ecocivilization Dream versus Corporate-Political Ecosystem Realities\nfrom Part III - Impacts on the Natural\/Human Ecosystem\nColin S. C. Hawes, University of Technology, Sydney\nBook: The Chinese Corporate Ecosystem\nThis chapter follows on from the previous one, evaluating the Chinese Communist Party's recent attempts to transition toward an ecocivilization and to address China's ecological and public health crisis through a new approach toward balanced economic growth. The chapter finds that while the intentions and accompanying legal reforms are admirable, implementation will likely fail due to continuing misalignment between official\/corporate incentives (especially at the local level) and central policies, compounded by the fragmented political structure and subversive elements within the corporate-political system that we identified in Chapters 4\u20137. The chapter also critically analyzes the recent introduction of public interest environmental lawsuits brought by procurators, which, while filling a major gap in legal enforcement against polluters, too often appear to result in opaque settlements with local governments rather than strong penalties against offenders.\nChapter 5 - Tech\nfrom"}
{"text":" II - International Economist, 1948\u20131976\nPerry Mehrling\nBook: Money and Empire\nFrom 1948 to mandatory retirement in 1976, Kindleberger taught international economics at MIT, which over that same time grew to become the leading economics department in the world. His original plan was to keep one foot in the world of policy, the better to push for Hansen's postwar vision of economic development in the Global South. Security clearance trouble, however, put that plan on hold, and forced him instead to embrace a more purely scholarly career. Over time, the increasingly technical character of modern economics pushed him to the fringes of academia, where he reinvented himself as an economic historian.\nThe Annual Global Incidence Rate of Extreme Weather Event Disasters Appears Positively Correlated with World GDP, 1961\u20132020\nMark E. Keim, Thomas More Smith, Frederick M. Burkle, Jr.\nJournal: Prehospital and Disaster Medicine \/ Volume 37 \/ Issue 4 \/ August 2022\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press: 12 July 2022, pp. 431-436\nThis study compared the per capita annual global incidence rate of disasters caused by natural hazards with the annual world real gross domestic product, GDP (per global capita), as reported during 1961 through 2020.\nSixty (60) values for the world real GDP per global capita (in constant 2015 $USD) were compared to corresponding annual values for global incidence rates for five natural disaster subgroups and then for a total of twelve individual disaster types that comprise the subgroups; each expressed as an annual global incidence rate (in terms of annual incidence per 100,000 persons). Calculations of multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were performed for comparing population-adjusted values for GDP to corresponding values.\nFour out of five hydrological and meteorological disasters were found to have a positive correlation with GDP. Results of the analysis revealed a relatively high degree of correlation between world GDP and the annual incidence of flood and storm disasters (P = 6.21 \u00d7 10\u221210 and P = 4.23 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively). The annual incidence of heat waves and cold weather disasters also appeared to correlate with GDP (P =.002 and P =.019, respectively). In comparison, wet landslides indicated no such correlation (P =.862). No significant associations were found among the seven other individual biological, climatological, and geophysical disasters and GDP.\nThe global incidence of four extreme weather (hydrometeorological) disasters appear to be positively associated with world real GDP during 1961-2020. These findings contradict previous postulates that the risk of disaster incidence is inversely associated with the capacity of the population.\n12 - Development, New Capitalisms, and Future of Global Conflict and Cooperation\nfrom Part III - National Configurations of Sectoral Models\nRoselyn Hsueh, Temple University, Philadelphia\nBook: Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism\nPrint publication: 30 June 2022, pp 331-360\nThis concluding chapter assesses the Strategic Value Framework for understanding the nonlinear and multidimensional nature of national sector-specific market pathways to development contrary to the expectations about the effects of open economy politics and regime type for particular modes of state-market interactions. The national configurations of sectoral models bridge different scholastic traditions in varieties of capitalism on the interactions between company-level and national-level characteristics and hierarchical state-business relations. Sector-specific dynamics emanating nation-specific sectoral pathways uncover how perceived strategic value and sectoral structures and organization institutions interact to affect how multinational and domestic companies alike experience the emergent institutional foundations of capitalism. This chapter further demonstrates how the new capitalisms play out in other strategic and non-strategic sectors in China, India, and Russia. The book concludes with analyzing the macro effects of the micro-institutional foundations on global conflict and cooperation\u2014from trade wars and cross-border cybersecurity to the Covid-19 global pandemic. The analytical leverage of the Strategic Value Framework in identifying national sector-specific patterns of market governance sheds light on the politics of the management of the Covid-19 pandemic and how they varied across countries and industries within them.\nComposition and sensitivity of residential energy consumption\nRaul Jimenez Mori, Ariel Yepez-Garcia, Demian Macedo\nJournal: Environment and Development Economics \/ Volume 27 \/ Issue 6 \/ December 2022\nWe examine how the composition of residential energy consumption and its sensitivity with respect to income changes. The paper characterizes the energy transition, analyzing the behavior of income elasticity of energy demand along the economic development stages by fuel types. The results indicate a nonlinear relationship between income and domestic energy consumption that can be explained by two factors. First, along the income distribution, consumption of modern fuels increases, replacing traditional and transitional fuels until modern fuels drive all of the growth in domestic energy demand. Second, at the highest income levels, income elasticity starts to decrease, leading to concavity in energy consumption. That is, the income elastic"}

{"text":"Agroforestry systems comprise trees and crops, or trees and pastures within the same field. Globally, they cover approximately 1 billion hectares of land and contribute to the livelihoods of over 900 million people. Agroforestry systems have the capacity to sequester large quantities of carbon (C) in both soil and biomass. However, these systems have not yet been fully considered in the approach to C accounting developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), largely due to the high diversity of agroforestry systems and scarcity of relevant data. \n Our literature review identified a total of 122 scientific, peer-reviewed articles associated with biomass C storage (50) and with soil organic carbon (SOC) (122), containing of total of 542 observations (324 and 218, respectively). Based on a synthesis of the reported observations, we are presenting a set of Tier 1 coefficients for biomass C storage for each of the 8 main agroforestry systems identified, including alley cropping, fallows, hedgerows, multistrata, parklands, shaded perennial-crop, silvoarable and silvopastoral systems, disaggregated by climate and region. Using the same agroforestry classification, we are presenting a set of stock change factors (FLU) and SOC accumulation\/loss rates for three main land use changes: cropland to agroforestry; forest to agroforestry; and grassland to agroforestry. Globally, the mean SOC stock change factors (\u00b1 confidence intervals) were estimated to be 1.25 \u00b1 0.04, 0.89 \u00b1 0.07, and 1.19 \u00b1 0.10, for the three main land use changes, respectively. However, these average coefficients hide huge disparities across and within different climates, regions, and types of agroforestry systems, highlighting the necessity to adopt the more disaggregated coefficients provided herein. We encourage national governments to synthesize data from local field experiments to generate country-specific factors for more robust estimation of biomass and SOC storage."}

Communities lead the way and we work to support them in gaining the skills needed to protect health and achieve environmental justice.\nOur Leadership Academies are designed to capacitate our participants, particularly our youth, to take action and continue on-going work in their community beyond the academy. We held discussions to find ways to design this years academy to have a greater reach beyond the students and hopefully lay the grounds down to growing our work into a youth-led campaign to address pesticide drift, one of the most pressing environmental injustice issues in Gonzales. Pictured here are our students on their trip to UC Santa Cruz where they spent the day learning about alternative solutions to the environmental injustices that are present in farmworker communities.\nSince 2015 Greenaction has held month-long Environmental Justice Youth Leadership Academy with 10 youth from the Salinas Valley in Gonzales, California. The goal of this Academy has been to support youth in becoming competent youth leaders and organizers in their community.\nIn 2005 Greenaction supported youth from Kettleman City to organize themselves to take action to address multiple environmental injustice issues in their community. Youth took the lead to organize the residents in Kettleman City to address the birth defect clusters that were discovered in Kettleman City. Since 2005 YPOP remains active in their community and watchdogs Chemical Waste Management and actively addresses issues of diesel pollution, pesticide drift and food and water insecurity.\nSince 2016 Greenaction has worked with the White Mesa Ute Mountain Ute community members to support them in learning how to write press releases, become better public speakers, organize and mobilize themselves and their community for health and environmental justice against the last uranium mill in the United States.\nWe know that the communities that are most impacted by environmental injustice also are impacted by food injustice. Our frontline communities are often low-income neighborhoods that are filled with liquor stores, fast-food restaurants and have very little to no access to healthy, organic and affordable foods. Greenaction works for environmental justice by supporting communities in their efforts to fight for their health by growing their own foods.\nOur Kettleman City organizers have been working with local residents, farmers and businesses to address food insecurity in their community and are taking initiative to start their own community garden. In 2018 the youth group YPOP along with local residents secured a modest piece of land to grow culturally relevant and organic food! Residents await the arrival of clean running water and hope to begin this garden in June of 2019.\nCalifornia is the state that uses the most pesticides in the entire nation. Children in agricultural communities are the most at risk. The largest demographic of farmworkers in California are latino\/migrant communities that are predominantly Spanish speaking. Many pesticides used in California are among the most hazardous known to cause acute poisoning, cancer, birth defects, sterility, neurotoxicity, damage to the developing child and young children. Through our leadership academies, Greenaction works with youth in the Salinas Valley to lead the pesticide drift work in the Salinas Valley and ensure that communities are given the tools, knowledge and support to file pesticide drift reports."}

It leaves his with 823,188 shares in the company.\nInvestors often watch for directors selling shares in the businesses they run, with many seeing it as a sign that the price has reached its peak.\nBarratt's share price fell 1.26% after the deal was revealed to the market.\nBut the company has said that the deal was a personal decision by Mr Thomas.\nA spokesman for the company said:\nThis transaction is purely to balance personal investments, and David Thomas retains 800,000 shares in the company.\nBarratt's recent trading update demonstrated strong momentum within the business, and there has been no change to guidance.\nThe sale of the shares was carried out a month after Mr Thomas told the market he expected profits to be higher than expected.\nThe shares have recently been trading at 12-year highs - levels not seen since just before the 2008 financial crisis - as Barratt, and its rivals, benefited from the Government's Help To Buy schemes and low interest rates.\nBut at Barratt, strong results earlier in July, despite saying it expected record profits of around \u00a3910m, with strong profit margins and extra homes being built, investor reaction was muted.\nRuss Mould, at AJ Bell, said at the time:\nHousebuilders look to be enjoying a last hurrah.\nThe muted market reaction... suggests some scepticism over the company's ability to build on this achievement and could also reflect the fact that the better than expected performance is seemingly flattered by a large one-off sale to a joint venture partner.\nFor now, the party goes on for the industry to a soundtrack of cheap mortgages, strong market dynamics and Help to Buy support.\nHowever, companies need to ensure they have the buffer of a strong balance sheet for when the music stops and the lights come back on.\nEmploymentNorth East firms Sage and Greggs on list of UK's best places to workThe Newcastle firms have both made Glassdoor's Best Places to Work list, which is based on feedback from employees\nThe 21 exciting North West companies to watch out for in 2021\nNorth WestAfter a tumultuous year, the region's business leaders have nominated the firms they say will do great things over the next 12 months\nGymshark co-founder plans \u00a350m investment fund for next generation of entrepreneurs\nWest MidlandsAfter securing bumper payout in the summer, Lewis Morgan tells BusinessLive about his plans to spot and nurture the business stars of the future\nHS2 joins Ladder for Greater Birmingham apprenticeship drive\nWest MidlandsHigh-speed rail project becomes an employer partner of our apprenticeship campaign\nSunday Times Rich List 2020: Sir James Dyson named wealthiest person"}

Sectors and organizations under analysis concern the energy, construction , financial sectors , textiles, food, chemical, automotive, telecommunications, tourism, aviation, media and SMEs.\nThis year , the report pays attention to CSR and the future of the company, as well as two types of organizations for which socially responsible practices are essential. These are the NGOs and trade unions. For the second time, the CSR Report is addressed on the national and international context of economic difficulties, although some economies are already seeing some signs of recovery. In a situation in which the economic debate focuses mainly on the output of the crisis, it becomes even more important that organizations focus their attention on management models that are sustainable in the future. One of the issues that should , without a doubt , part of the agendas of the RSC , as shown in this report, is the reconciliation of work and family life. Although the number of Spanish companies developing reconciliation policies is limited, the companies themselves are convinced that these policies improve the organization and, in general , increase employee engagement. This report also incorporates the third edition of a survey of experts in CSR . Despite economic uncertainty does not seem to have diminished the interest of companies to CSR, the fact is that this third wave, possibly as a result of downsizing in organizations, has received a volume of response less than in previous times. Nevertheless, the responses confirm the trend of the previous year in terms of increasing social trust in business ."}

{"text":"\/ Press Releases\nGerman Environment Minister Schulze: Climate action in Europe now set in stone\nEnvironment Minister Svenja Schulze: \"Our new EU target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 sets an example internationally\" \u00a9 Geisler-Fotopress\nToday at the Environment Council, the EU environment ministers agreed on a joint position on the European Climate Law.\nFor the first time, the European Union will enshrine in law the legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. Today at the Environment Council in Brussels, chaired by German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, the EU environment ministers agreed on a joint position on the European Climate Law, which sets the climate neutrality goal into legislation and lays down a higher climate target for 2030. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are to be reduced by at least 55 percent compared to 1990 levels. So far, a reduction of 25 percent has been achieved; the previous goal had been to reach at least 40 percent by 2030. It was also decided that the member states will submit the new 2030 target as the EU NDC to the United Nations this year, as envisaged in the Paris Agreement.\nGerman Environment Minister Schulze commented:\nThis agreement sends an important message internationally that the European Union is making a commitment to climate action that is irreversible and binding. We Europeans are proving that we take the Paris Agreement seriously. Our new EU target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 sets an example internationally which establishes a credible and prudent path to climate neutrality in 2050. For the coming decade, this means doubling our pace on climate action. All EU member states will have to step up their efforts. Germany, too, will have to contribute more to climate action than the 55 percent greenhouse gas reduction previously agreed. We will now have to take more resolute climate action measures in all areas: in the energy transition, in transport and buildings as well as in all industrial processes.\nThe European Climate Law has not yet set out the measures for achieving the targets or the contributions of the member states. These will be determined once the European Commission presents its proposals for implementation instruments in summer 2021.\nFurthermore, the European Climate Law envisages regular reviews that are closely aligned with the Paris Agreement. Accordingly, every five years the European Commission will review whether EU and member state measures aimed at climate neutrality are consistent with the intended trajectory to achieve this goal. Similar to the Paris Agreement, the first review will take place in 2023.\nThe European Council will swiftly negotiate the European Climate Law further in the trilogue with the European Parliament and the European Commission. The talks will then be finalised as planned under the Portuguese Council Presidency.\nOn 18 December 2020, the German Council Presidency and the European Commission jointly submitted the higher Nationally Determined Contribution of the EU and its member states to the United Nations. Federal environment minister Svenja Schulze: \"This sends an important message internationally, as we can now credibly urge our international partners to follow us on this path. I expect that there will be many more contributions submitted before the next UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in just under a year.\" The ambition mechanism of the Paris Agreement calls on all parties to update their NDCs every five years and make them as ambitious as possible, with the aim of gradually coming closer to the agreement's goal: limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees and if possible to less than 1.5 degrees. Along with the EU, 16 countries have also submitted new NDCs to the UNFCCC Secretariat. More are on the way. At the Climate Ambition Summit on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on 12 December, 44 additional countries announced more ambitious NDCs for 2030.\nEnvironment Council in Brussels: These topics were on the agendaInternal link\nOn 17 December, EU environment ministers met in Brussels under the auspices of Germany's Presidency of the Council of the EU. The meeting was led by German Minister of the Environment, Svenja Schulze.\nOn the way to a European Climate Law: Questions and answers about climate and environmental policyInternal link\nAt December's meeting of the European Council, the last during Germany's Council Presidency, EU heads of state and government agreed to a significantly higher climate target: a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 55% of 1990 levels.\nEuropean Council in Brussels: Agreement reached on the budget and climate protectionInternal link\nAt the last European Council meeting during Germany's Presidency of the Council, the heads of state or government of the 27 EU member states have taken important decisions. Together, they set an ambitious new climate target and agreed on the multiannual financial framework and the recovery fund."}

{"text":"Bioenergy, Wind Power\nEPA Buys Renewable Energy For Cincinnati Labs\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency it will power three of its research facilities in Ohio with 100 percent renewable energy.\nWASHINGTON, DC, US, 2001-09-05 [SolarAccess.com] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency it will power three of its research facilities in Ohio with 100 percent renewable energy. By early next year, EPA will receive 9 percent of its electricity from green sources at facilities located in Richmond (California), Golden (Colorado), Chelmsford (Massachusetts), Manchester (Washington) and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati facilities have committed to purchasing a total of 15,560,000 kWh of renewable energy annually for three years, at a premium, with a three-year option to renew. Community Energy Inc. will supply 778,000 kWh of New Wind Energy(tm) each year from the Exelon Power Team at Mill Run, Pennsylvania, which will comprise 5 percent of EPA's estimated usage in Cincinnati. ComEd, a subsidiary of Exelon that serves customers in northern Illinois, in partnership with Environmental Resources Trust, will supply the remainder of the renewable energy contract with landfill gas energy from ComEd's territory in Illinois. By purchasing wind and biomass energy, EPA can claim large reductions in emissions of 16,000 tons of carbon dioxide, 112,000 pounds of nitrous oxides, and 246,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide each year. \"With this purchase of New Wind Energy, the EPA is leading the way to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future,\" says Brent Alderfer, president of Community Energy. \"EPA's decision to buy locally generated wind energy shows others that there are sensible clean energy choices that can help to create a clear future. This is the kind of real environmental leadership that will make a difference.\" \"The Bush Administration has asked the government to be the first to conserve energy,\" explains EPA administrator Christine Whitman. \"These purchases represent a creative and innovative approach to help solve our nation's energy crisis, while achieving tremendous environmental benefits and charting the way for the emerging green power market.\""}

{"text":"Posted by admin on Wednesday, 6 April, 2011\nAlstom to set up a 650 million euros, super critical power generation equipment for a coal-fired power plant that will create enough electricity for nearly 2 million households in Malaysia.\nThe project is worth about US $ 1.4 b in total.\nAlstom signed the contract with TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd to equip what it called southeast Asia's first 1,000 megawatt supercritical coal-fired plant in Manjung. Supercritical plants operate at higher temperatures than normal coal-fired plants.\nThe high temperature increases the presure at which they operate, which in turns improves their efficiency, increasing the amount of power output and decreasing emissions per unit of fuel burned.\nThe development of coal fired supercritical power plant technology is best described as an evolutionary advancement towards greater power output per unit and higher efficiency. Energy conversion efficiency of steam turbine cycle can be improved by increasing the main steam pressure and temperature.\nSupercritical steam conditions are primarily attached to lower electricity costs through improved fuel economy, and with a modest increase in investments and high availability a sound economy of the concept is guaranteed.\nAs the name super critical power plant, suggests, coal-fired supercritical power plants operate at very high temperature and pressure (580 degree centigrade temp. with a pressure of 23 MPa) resulting much higher heat efficiencies (46%), as compare to sub-critical coal-fired plants which operates at 455 degree centigrade temp., and efficiency of within 40%. Some of the benefits of advanced supercritical power plants include:\n(a) Reduced fuel costs due to improved plant efficiency;\n(b) Significant improvement of environment by reduction in CO2 emissions;\n(c) Plant costs comparable with sub-critical technology and less than other clean coal technologies;\n(d) Much reduced NOx, SOx and particulate emissions;\n(e) Can be fully integrated with appropriate CO2 capture technology\n\"Supercritical\" is a thermodynamic expression describing the state of a substance where there is no clear distinction between the liquid and the gaseous phase.\nWater reaches this state at a pressure above 22.1 MPa. The efficiency of the thermodynamic process of a coal-fired power describes how much of the energy that is fed into the cycle is converted into electrical energy. The higher the output of electrical energy for a given amount of energy input, the greater the efficiency. If the energy input to the cycle is kept at a constant, the output can be increased by selecting elevated pressures and temperatures for the water-steam cycle.\nIncreased thermal efficiency observed when the temperature and pressure of the steam isincreased. By raising the temperature from 580 \u00b0C to 760 \u00b0C and the pressure out of thehigh pressure feed-water pump from 33 MPa to 42 MPa, the thermal efficiency improvesby about 4% (Ultra-supercritical steam condition).\nCurrent designs of supercritical plants have installation costs that are only 2% higher than those of sub-critical plants. Fuel costs are considerably lower due to the increased efficiency and operating costs are at the same level as sub-critical plants. Specific installation cost i.e. the cost per megawatt (MW) decreases with increased plant size. This plant concept fulfils the requirement to balance reliable power supply, sustainable use of existing resources and economic operation.\nThe plant is expected to come online in 2015, Alstom added in a statement on Monday.\nTNB Janamanjung is a unit of Malaysia's state-controlled Tenega Nasional power generation, transmission and distribution company.\nCategory: CCS Projects\nPosted by admin on Friday, 1 April, 2011\nThe Second International Forum on Transportation of Co2 by Pipeline:\nThe Second International Forum on Transportation of Co2 by pipeline (22 \u2013 23 June 2011) is organized by Tiratsoo Technical and Clarion in Newcastle, UK.\nThis international forum will come at the issues from these six technical perspectives:\nRegulations and Risk Assessment\nHydraulic Modelling\nProfessor Martin Downie, Newcastle University\nDr Julia Race, Newcastle University\nPatricia Seevam, BP\nJohn Tiratsoo, Tiratsoo Technical\nFor registration https:\/\/www.clarion.org\/CO2\/CO2_jun11\/registration.php\nCarbon management for power plants 2011:\nCarbon Management Power Plants 2011 (June 28-29, San Francisco, USA) will bring together SVPs, VPs and Directors from leading power plant operators around the world to address regulatory uncertainty around carbon emissions and explain how to apply newly commercialized technologies including CCS technologies.\nLeading utility companies at the event will be providing the following solutions:\nRegulation Focus: Hear how EPA regulation on current and future regulatory framework in the US and the rest of the world specific to carbon emissions for power plants and understand what the risk will be for companies who do not comply\nPartnership Opportun"}

It plays an important role in determining the climate through its influence on vegetation, types of soil formed, soil moisture, clouds, snow and ice. The hydrological cycle is also responsible for transport of heat from lower latitudes to mid latitudes.\nThe most important natural phenomenon on earth, the water cycle also known as the hydrological cycle \u2013 describes constant movement and endless recycling water between the atmosphere, land surface, and belowground. The hydrological cycle involves exchange of heat energy, which leads to temperature changes.\nH20 Molecule:\nH20 consists of one atom of oxygen of hydrogen. The water molecule has a positive charge on the side of hydrogen atoms and negative charge on the other side. Water molecules tend to attract each other because the positive ends attracts to the negative ends.\nIn reality water molecules are three dimensional, and water follows the VSEPR rules- VSEPR, or Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion, is a theory that allows us to build accurate 3 dimensional models of atoms and molecules.\nThe bonds between oxygen and the hydrogen in the H2O molecule are not even, the oxygen has a larger share of the electrons due to its nucleus containing more protons, also called as its electro negativity. This leads each of those bonds to be a polar covalent bond, resulting in water having a slight positive charge on its Hydrogen atoms, as seen to the right.\nThis then makes water a polar molecule, as it has two negatively charged parts [the electron pairs that are unbound] and two positive parts [the Hydrogen atoms]. These opposite charges are attracted to each other. This holds water molecules together which explains why water is a liquid at room temperature while almost all other similar sized molecules are gases. This also accounts for water's excellent dissolving capacity for other charged substances such as salt, and why uncharged substances [non polar] such as oil do not mix readily with water.\nHydrological Process:\nThe"}
{"text":" primary step of the water cycle starts with the evaporation- The primary source of energy for evaporation is the solar radiation. The sun, which drives the water cycle, heats water in oceans and seas. Rising air currents take the water, as vapour, up into the atmosphere, along with water from \"evapotranspiration\"- which is water transpired or \"breathed out\" from plants and evaporated from the soil.\nAir currents move water vapour around the globe; the cooler temperatures in the atmosphere cause it to condense into clouds. The cloud particles collide, grow, and float around until they fall from the sky as precipitation. Some precipitation falls as snow and can accumulate as ice caps and glaciers, where it can stay, as frozen water, for thousands of years. In warmer climates, snow melts during the warmer spring and summer months, and that water flows into streams and rivers, which eventually return it to the ocean, or into the groundwater, which eventually reach underground aquifers. Then again the initial process continues to roll. This is a big cycle and a never ending process.\nThere are four basic steps that tie this all together\nEvaporation,\nCondensation,\nPrecipitation and run off.\nEvaporation:\nThe transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere. The primary source of energy for evaporation is the solar radiation. Evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration from plants, though together they are specifically referred to as evapotranspiration. Total annual evapotranspiration amounts to approximately 505,000 km3 [121,000 cu mi] of water, 434,000 km3 [104,000 cu mi] of which evaporates from the oceans.\nEvaporation should not be confused with boiling because when water undergoes evaporation, only water molecules that are on the surface of the water are actually turning into water vapour. In the boiling process, existing water reaches a complete phase change and therefore, the water is being turned into gas at a much faster rate. For e.g. the steam that is rising off of a pot of boiling water is water vapour evaporating.\nThe movement of water through the atmosphere, specifically from over the oceans to over land, is called transport. Some of the earth's moisture transport is visible as clouds, which themselves consist of ice crystals and\/or tiny water droplets.\nCondensation:\nCondensation is the change of physical state of matter from gaseous phase into liquid phase. In the water cycle process, the change is from water to water vapour.\nPrecipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravity. Precipitation is a main component of water cycle. Precipitation occurs as rain and also as snow, hail, fog drip, and sleet. Approximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 cu mi) of water falls as precipitation each year, 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans.\nPrecipitation can be divided into 3 categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, liquid water or ice.\nRain is a type of precipitation during warmer weather, occurs mainly when the clouds are saturated. Snow is a type of precipitation like rain but at cooler temperatures eventually melts and becomes runoff in stream Mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall.\nStratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation.\nConvective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation.\nGroundwater:\nSome of the precipitation soaks into the ground and this is the main source of the formation of the waters found on land \u2013 rivers, lakes, groundwater and glaciers.\nRunoff:\nThere are different ways by which water moves across the land; they are surface runoff and channel runoff.\nSurface runoff is when the precipitation rate exceeds infiltration rate, or when the soil is saturated, water begins to move down slope on ground surface. As it flows, the water may seep into the ground, evaporate into the air, become stored in lakes or reservoirs, or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses.\nOther Process involved:\nInfiltration:\nInfiltration is the process by which surface water enters into the soil ground. Once infiltrated, the water becomes soil moisture or groundwater. It is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the near soil. Infiltration is governed by two forces, gravity and capillary action. Capillary action is when the water gets absorbed to the soil under the force of gravity. The process of infiltration can continue only if there is room available for additional water at the top of the soil surface.\nThis is a general hydrological budget formula, when all the components except \""}

In the water cycle, this is seen when ice or snow is heated up enough to turn directly into water vapour.\nAdvection:\nThe movement of water in solid, liquid or vapour states through the atmosphere. Advection is a lateral or horizontal transfer of mass, heat, or other property. Accordingly, winds that blow across Earth's surface represent advection movements of air. Advection is important for the formation of orographic cloud and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle. Advection also takes place in the ocean in the form of currents. Without advection, water that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land.\nTranspiration:\nTranspiration is the process where water contained in the liquid form in plants is converted to vapour and released to the atmosphere.\nWater Vapour escapes through open stomata, mainly on the undersides of leaves. Water enters the stomata from the inner cell; the guard cells open creating pores through which water vapour escapes, this process is called Transpiration.\nThe precipitation that is intercepted by plant foliage and eventually evaporates back to the atmosphere rather than falling to the ground\nEffects of Climate change on hydrological cycle:\nGreenhouse gases and global warming are the major players that are seriously disrupting the world's water cycle. It has been estimated that global warming by 4\u00b0C (7.2\u00b0F) is expected to increase global precipitation by about 10 percent. Increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, have led to a warming at the surface, by nearly 0.6\u00b0C (1.0\u00b0F) during the twentieth century, and it is widely believed that this trend will continue in the twenty-first century, leading to a higher sea-surface temperature and several other natural calamities.\nhttp:\/\/dardel.info\/images\/hydrologic_cycle.gif\nhttp:\/\/schoolworkhelper.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.jpg\nhttp:\/\/www.green-planet-solar-energy.com\/images\/h2o-molecule.gif\nhttp:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/_e3fbY8dy2kY\/SuwKzRgo74I\/AAAAAAAAADk\/0EhLakolSKw\/s320\/condensation2.jpg\nhttp:\/\/www.tech-faq.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/Evaporation.jpg\nhttp:\/\/t1.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCSMFRFPH-fQSp9AJ_6y_-OMvzEdGuBj2QpJPS0Z049h3tab06MQ&t=1\nhttp:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__iMtPpHiaxo\/Ry878TJS_cI\/AAAAAAAAAhc\/Ukd0GHhnYxM\/s320\/transpiration.gif\nHydrological cycle:\nhttp:\/\/www.isws.illinois.edu\/docs\/watercycle\/images\/hcycle.jpg\nhttp:\/\/water.nationalacademies.org\/images\/water_cycle.jpg\nWebsite and PDF:\nhttp:\/\/www.green-planet-solar-energy.com\/h2o-molecule.html\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/hDn0XU\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/gVhxZm\nhttp:\/\/www.authorstream.com\/Presentation\/Samuel-32361-5-WATER-CYCLE-Molecule-Condensation-Convection-Cloud-Formation-Precipitation-Snow-Rain-Freshwater-as-Entertainment-ppt-powerpoint\/\nhttp:\/\/www.eolss.net\/ebooks\/Sample%20Chapters\/C07\/E2-16-10-01.pdf\nhttp:\/\/web.aces.uiuc.edu\/vista\/pdf_pubs\/WATRQUAL.PDF\nhttp:\/\/www.aces.edu\/crd\/publications\/wtrqlty\/wq1.pdf\nhttp:\/\/water."}

CO2 EOR can add value by maximizing oil recovery while at the same time offering a bridge to a reduced carbon emissions future. It also reduces the cost of sequestering CO2 by earning revenues for the CO2 emitter from sales of CO2 to oil producers.\nEnhanced Oil Recovery (also known as improved oil recovery or tertiary oil recovery) is a technique that is employed to increase the recovery of crude oil by injecting carbon-dioxide into the pore spaces of the rocks to extract from an oil field.\nNow, how does injecting CO2 into the pore spaces of a rock aid in crude oil recovery?\nWhen carbon-dioxide is injected into an oil reservoir, it mixes readily with the residual crude oil\/ stranded oil. (oil that is left in the reservoir after conventional recovery techniques have been completed is referred to as stranded oil).\nThe solubility increases further when the carbon-dioxide is compressed and the oil contains lesser hydrocarbons (low-density) At one point, the miscibility of carbon-dioxide and oil stops.\nAs the temperature increases (and the CO2 density decreases), or as the oil density increases (as the light hydrocarbon fraction decreases), the minimum pressure needed to attain Oil\/CO2 miscibility increases.\nTherefore, when the injected CO2 and residual oil are miscible, the physical forces holding the two phases apart disappears. This enables the CO2 to displace the oil from the rock pores, pushing it towards a producing well just as a cleaning solvent would remove oil from your tools.\nThis CO2 \"flooding\" used for enhanced oil recovery can result in a recovery of up to 20 percent more of the original oil in place.\nImage Courtesy: NETL\nNeed for Enhanced Oil Recovery:\nCO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) offers the potential for storing significant volumes of carbon dioxide emissions while increasing domestic oil production. Four notable benefits would accrue from integrating CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery:\nFirst, CO2-EOR provides a large, \"value added\" market for sale of CO2 emissions captured from new coal-fueled power plants. The size of this market is on the order of 7,500 million metric tons between now and 2030. Sales of captured CO2 emissions would help defray some of the costs of installing and operating carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. These CO2 sales would support \"early market entry\" of up to 49 (one GW size) installations of CCS technology in the coal-fueled power sector.\nSecond, storing CO2 with EOR helps bypass two of today's most serious barriers to using geological storage of CO2 \u2013 \u2013 establishing mineral (pore space) rights and assigning long-term liability for the injected CO2.\nThird, the oil produced with injection of captured CO2 emissions is 70% \"carbon-free\", after accounting for the difference between the carbon content in the incremental oil produced by EOR and the volume of CO2 stored in the reservoir. With \"next generation\" CO2 storage technology and a value for storing CO2, the oil produced by EOR could be 100+% \"carbon free\".\nCO2 EOR and Sequestration\nBefore embarking on analyses of the purported cost savings potential, energy security, and environmental benefits of CO2-EOR, it is important to briefly clarify the distinction between CO2-EOR and CCS. CO2- EOR represents the process by which CO2 is injected into depleting oil fields for the purpose of enhancing the recovery fraction of the oil that remains in the field following primary and secondary production methods (Meyer, 2007). According to recent survey data by Koottungal (2010), there are 129\nCO2-EOR projects operating around the world, with 114 of those in the U.S. Given the lack of binding GHG constraints in the countries where these CO2-EOR operations are taking place, one must assume that each of these projects is"}
{"text":" focused on optimizing oil recovery. The vast majority of CO2-EOR projects inject CO2 produced from natural underground accumulations; in the U.S. and Canada, naturally-sourced CO2 provides an estimated 83% of the CO2 injected for EOR, with anthropogenic sources providing the rest (Moritis, 2010).\nCO2 EOR is being used by industries as it seems to hold a great potential for the permanent storage of carbon-dioxide. Though many experts raise concern over the issues caused by geologic sequestration, studies reveal that the CO2 EOR could be one of the best alternatives for dealing with carbon emissions in a safe manner.\nEOR operations account for 9 million metric tons of carbon, equivalent to about 80 percent of the industrial use of CO2, every year. Although about 20 percent of CO2 used in EOR comes from natural gas processing plants, the majority used for EOR comes from natural underground sources and does not represent a net reduction in CO2 emissions. However, industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers the potential to significantly alter this situation.\nBecause of the cost of naturally sourced CO2\u2014roughly $10-15 per metric ton\u2014a CO2 flood operator seeks to recycle as much as possible to minimize future purchases of the gas. All of the injected CO2 is retained within the subsurface formation after a project has ended or recycled to subsequent projects. After years of experience with CO2 floods, oil and gas operators are confident that the CO2 left in the ground when oil production ends and wells are shut in will stay permanently stored there, assuming the wells are properly plugged and abandoned.\nMarket for Captured CO2 emissions offered by EOR\nThe size and value of the market for captured CO2 emissions offered by enhanced oil recovery rests on three pillars:\n(1) the size and nature of the domestic crude oil resource base, particularly the large portion of this resource base unrecoverable with existing primary and secondary oil recovery methods;\n(2) the ability of CO2-EOR to recovery a portion of this currently unrecoverable (\"stranded\") domestic oil, while efficiently storing CO2;\n(3) the impact of alternative oil prices and CO2 costs on the volume of oil that could be economically produced\nSource: RC Ferguson, 2009\nRevenue Streams from Sale of CO2 and Production of Oil.\nA most important benefit from integrating CO2-EOR and CO2 storage is that productive use of CO2 for oil recovery, as opposed to its non-productive disposal in saline formations, would provide a series of revenue streams:\nOne of these revenue streams (or cost avoidance) would accrue to the capturer of the CO2, helping lower the overall cost of conducting CCS.\nA second revenue stream would accrue to state (and local) governments (or the National treasury if the EOR project is on Federal lands) from royalties, plus severance and ad valorem taxes. These revenues, in states such as Texas and Wyoming, are a primary source of funds for school systems and other public services.\nA third revenue stream would accrue to a variety of individuals and entities from royalty payments, equipment sales, jobs and profits stemming from a successful CO2-EOR project.\nSource: Advance Source International ( 2010)\nCO2 Enhanced Recovery Live Projects\nMore from here \u2013 http:\/\/powerplantccs.com\/blog\/tag\/veloxo-therm-process\nMore from here \u2013 http:\/\/powerplantccs.com\/blog\/tag\/co2-eor\nMore from here \u2013 http:\/\/powerplantccs.com\/blog\/2010\/03\/12-us-industrial-ccs-projects-pursue-1-4-billion-in-doe-funding.html\nOver 48 million metric tons (tonnes) per year of CO2 are used for EOR. Of this total, about 25 percent (12 million tonnes) is anthropogenic in origin i.e., produced by human activities such as oil refining or fertilizer manufacturing (Trinity 2006). The rest is extracted from naturally occurring deposits.\nThe CO2 used to increase oil production is an expensive commodity, and for this reason oil companies are motivated to ensure that up to three quarters of CO2 injected remains underground in the oil field. The amount of CO2 sequestered is highly dependent on whether the field is blown-down following any CO2 operations. Further research and development in this area is expected to improve the storage rate to close to 100 percent.

There are currently eight states that offer additional EOR tax-incentives on incremental oil. CO2 EOR floods recover 206,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) representing 12% of the US oil production. (DOE) show that depleted oil and gas wells in the United States and Canada have the potential to sequester over 82 billion tonnes of carbon in total (DOE 2007).\nUS CO2 \u2013 EOR Acvitity( 2010)\nImage Courtesy: http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/mitei\/docs\/reports\/eor-css\/kuuskraa.pdf\nThe CO2 EOR in the UK and Norwegian Sectors\nGovernments of the UK and Norway share the most immediate vested interests to create a demand for CO2 in the North Sea. For the UK exchequer this could provide a substantial revenue stream from taxation on incremental oil, additional jobs and improved balance of payments due to reduced energy imports.\nEstimates within the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Sustainable Hydrocarbon Additional Recovery Programme (SHARP) put CO2 EOR incremental production between 0.9 and 2.3 billion barrels.\nThe Norwegian government is recognised as being well versed with managing its oil assets and still retains a large equity ownership through its stakes in Petoro (100%), Statoil (78%) and Norsk Hydro (44%) and a 78% offshore taxation rate. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate conservatively estimates that a potential of 1.5 to two billion barrels CO2-incremental oil exists on the NCS with a value of US$45 to US$55 billion.\nKey Implementation Challenges:\nA key implementation challenge for using CO2-EOR to accelerate CCS is matching CO2 sources from power and industrial plants with large oil fields favorable for enhanced oil recovery.\nCertain regions, such as the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), already contain large oil fields favorable for CO2. As such, with about 100 billion kilowatt hours of coal-fired generation and about 100 million metric tons of annual CO2 emissions from coal-fired power (equal to 3 billion metric tons in 30 years), entities within the ERCOT area should be able to relatively easily implement CO2-EOR and CO2 storage, assuming proper economic incentives and\/or regulations are in place. (Source: MIT, 2010)\nOther reasons which prevent the implementation of CO2 projects include:\nProject cash flow \u2013 a major objection to CO2\u2013 floods by operators in the US and Canada has been the relatively high initial investment and CO2 costs coupled with a possible long response time of one to two years before noticeable incremental oil production. For smaller independent operators moving into the North Sea, such considerations can be just as important as maximising total recovered reserves.\nProject risk management \u2013 operators know that CO2 will enable them to recover significant quantities of incremental oil and the technology does exist to do this; They do not receive sufficient rewards to compete for internal capital against a new field development in another oil region with lower production costs. Governments are in competition for investment capital in their oil regions and more costly tertiary recovery will not take place without incentives that address this fact.\nCost and Economics of CO2 Enhanced Recovery\nCarbon-dioxide EOR is a very capital intensive exercise, the highest cost for such type of projects is mainly"}
{"text":" the purchase of carbon-dioxide. For example, some of the cost components for enhanced oil recovery include drilling wells to serve as both injectors and producers. Even installing a CO2 recycle plant and corrosion resistant field production infrastructure, and laying CO2 gathering and transportation pipelines could be capital intensive.\nThere are three fundamental economic indicators that help quantify the commercial viability of a CO2-EOR project:\n(i) The delivered price of CO2 at the oilfield.\n(ii) The value of permanently stored CO2 as a greenhouse gas (GHG).\n(iii) The value of the incremental oil (ie. volume and price).\nBoth capital and operating costs for an EOR project can vary over a range, and the value of CO2 behaves as a commodity, priced at pressure, pipeline quality, and accessibility, so it is important for an operator to understand how these factors might change.\nTotal CO2 costs (both purchase price and recycle costs) can amount to 25 to 50 percent of the cost per barrel of oil produced. In addition to the high up-front capital costs of a CO2 supply\/injection\/recycling scheme, the initial CO2injection volume must be purchased well in advance of the onset of incremental production. Hence, the return on investment for CO2 EOR tends to be low, with a gradual, long-term payout.\nBreak- up costs:\nCosts breakdown for a CO2 \u2013 EOR\/storage operation in the North Sea (Source: IEF, 2010)\nOil Price ($\/Barrel) $70 *\nGravity\/Basis Differentials, Royalties and\nProduction Taxes ($15)\nNet Wellhead Revenues ($\/Barrel) $55\nCapital Cost Amortization ($5 to $10)\nCO2 Costs (@ $2\/Mcf for purchase;\n$0.70\/Mcf for recycle) ($15)\nWell\/Lease Operations and Maintenance ($10 to $15)\nEconomic Margin, Pre-Tax ($\/Barrel) $15 to $25*\nCost and Economics of CO2 EOR ( Source: DOE, 2009)\nThe cost and economics of the CO2 enhanced oil recovery have been illustrated in the table below: As of March 2011, the price of the oil is $115\/ barrel, assuming all the costs highlighted above remain the same, the profit margin would be around $60-$70\/ barrel.\nGuidelines for Safe CO2 \u2013 Enhanced Oil Recovery:\nSome have asked whether captured CO2 can be stored in a safe manner \u2014 whether stored CO2 may leak out of its intended confinement space and either contaminate drinking water supplies or escape to the atmosphere. \"Most detectable leaks that lead to elevated CO2 concentrations, and virtually all hazardous leaks, occur in volcanic areas that are highly fractured and therefore unsuitable for CO2 storage\" (Benson, 2006).\nGood site selection, comprehensive site characterization, proper injection rates, appropriate site monitoring, operation of the facility within established safety envelopes, coupled with the implementation of remedial measures if leakage is detected, assures the safe geologic storage of CO2\nSome guidelines of safe CO2 storage could be obtained from here:\nhttp:\/\/www.uscsc.org\/Files\/Admin\/Educational_Papers\/AttachmentToUSCSCReportOnCCSSafetyPaper_GeologicalStorageRiskAssessment.pdf\nhttp:\/\/southwestcarbonpartnership.org\/_Resources\/PDF\/3%5B1%5D.%20Is%20CCS%20Safe.pdf\nCO2 \u2013 Enhanced Oil Recovery \u2013 Q & A\nWill the carbon-dioxide leak from underground?\nNo, this is very unlikely. For well-selected, designed and managed geological storage sites, experts calculate that the rock formations are likely to retain over 99 percent of the injected CO2 for over 1000 years.\nAny CO2 that is produced along with oil and natural gas is captured and re-injected. The company operating the EOR project bought the CO2 and expects to re-inject it if any is produced, to maximize its value. It only has value when it is used to remove oil from the rock formation underground, so there is a strong economic motivation to collect it for re-injection, either in the current project or another.\nWhen a CO2 EOR flood is finished, the CO2 that remains underground, stays there. Monitoring efforts can be put into place to make sure that is true.\nCan Storing CO2 Underground Cause Earthquakes?\nEarly research in the 1950s showed that the injection of fluids at sufficiently high pressures can cause \"hydrofracturing\" or fault activation or slippages along pre-existing fractures (in places where faults already existed). These could induce small-to-medium-sized earthquakes. Based on an improved understanding of local and regional stresses in the earth's crust, guidelines have been developed to prevent injection-"}
{"text":"induced micro-seismicity. Now, regulatory agencies limit injection rates and pressures to avoid unintentional hydro-fracturing. Micro-seismic monitoring is often done early in a project to establish safe operational parameters for injection.\nNo. Oil companies have been injecting CO2 in West Texas for decades and have not caused any earthquakes. Large volumes of water have been re-injected into oil fields all over the country without any evidence of the injection having caused earthquakes.\nCarbon dioxide sequestration projects will operate under similar guidelines. Storage site locations will be carefully selected to avoid such problems. In addition, there have been decades of experience with EOR (using CO2 injection) and natural gas storage projects without encountering such problems. There is also some limited experience in Japan, where a CO2 storage site was subjected to two earthquakes (unrelated to the stored CO2) in the 6.8 range on the Richter scale and experienced no leakage.

While this technology has been implemented by the oil industry since 1972, further research is needed to ensure that the stored CO2 remains isolated from the atmosphere and the biosphere on the order of thousands of years and that the storage process remains as safe and economically viable as possible.\nEOR can add value by maximizing oil recovery while at the same time offering a bridge to a reduced carbon emissions future. It also reduces the cost of sequestering CO2 by earning revenues for the CO2 emitter from sales of CO2 to oil producers.\nThe United States leads the world in both the number of CO2 EOR projects and in the volume of CO2 EOR oil production, in large part because of favorable geology. (Natural Resources Defense Council July 2008).\nThe key facilitating parameters are market oil price, CO2 delivered price and government incentives. It is the type and magnitude of the incentives that will draw the parties together to realise as much of the potential incremental oil prize. No other commercial solution has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions as much as CO2 for EOR.\nResearch studies reveal that the use of CO2-EOR yields an additional 6 \u2013 15% of the original oil in place (OOIP) and therefore can produce 10 \u2013 30% more oil from a chosen field.\nCO2-EOR will result in additional jobs being created on platforms and onshore facilities. Also, the government commitment to help with costs for platform decommissioning will be further delayed.\nOil produced by CO2-EOR will usually not be recovered using conventional primary and secondary methods of extraction. Therefore the oil and its associated economic benefits will be lost if CO2-EOR is not implemented\nhttp:\/\/www.isco.com\/WebProductFiles\/Applications\/105\/Application_Notes\/Enhanced_Oil_Recovery.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.cairnindia.com\/KC\/Brochures\/EOR.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.fe.doe.gov\/programs\/oilgas\/eor\/\nhttp:\/\/www.fossil.energy.gov\/programs\/oilgas\/publications\/eor_co2\/Undeveloped_Oil_Document.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.energy.ca.gov\/process\/pubs\/electrotech_opps_tr113836.pdf http:\/\/www.netl.doe.gov\/technologies\/oil-gas\/publications\/EP\/small_CO2_eor_primer.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.touchoilandgas.com\/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-3.html\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/gCW0kZ\nhttp:\/\/ie.jrc.ec.europa.eu\/publications\/scientific_publications\/2005\/EUR21895EN.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.netl.doe.gov\/publications\/factsheets\/program\/Prog053.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.netl.doe.gov\/technologies\/oil-gas\/publications\/brochures\/CO2Brochure_Mar2006.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.bgr.bund.de\/cln_151\/nn_1182122\/EN\/Themen\/Geotechnik\/CO2-Speicherung\/FAQ\/faq__node__en.html?__nnn=true&__nnn=true#doc1182120bodyText5\nhttp:\/\/www.netl.doe.gov\/publications\/proceedings\/01"}

However, China's per capita Co2 emission is less compared to USA or Europe. In 2009, per capita Co2 emission in China was 6.1. Nearly two-third of China's energy needs ie 80% of electricity, 50% of industrial fuel use and 60% of chemical fuel use comes from coal. A number of studies show that coal will be a major part of China's energy until at least 2030. Even though there are strong policy incentives for energy efficiency, renewables and other low carbon technologies, this situation will prevail. According to a research agency, emission from fossil fuel combustion has increased by 9 percent.\nChina uses more coal than the United States, Europe and Japan combined. But China is emerging as world's leading builder of more efficient, less polluting coal power plants. Global warming gases from China are expected to continue to increase. China's aim is to use the latest technologies to curb the rate of increase. Only half the country's coal-fired power plants have the emissions control equipment to remove sulfur compounds that cause acid rain. 60% of new plants are being built using newer highly efficient technology. They are expensive.\nMost of the coal resources are in the west and north regions of China; Shanxi, Shaanxi and inner Mongolia together account for 65% of the coal reserves while southern part of the country mainly Guizhou and Yunnan account for 13% of coal reserves. Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Xinijiang, Tibet, Qinghai, Ningxia, Guangdong, Hanian, Taiwan, Shanghai, Sichuan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hubei etc. are the major coal resources in China.\nFollowing are some of the CCS projects in China:\nLuzhou Natural Gas Chemicals\nJapan \u2013 China EOR Project\nGreenGen\nPCC Demo Project\nNot enough information is available at present regarding other CCS projects in China.

This is the largest such facility in china and one of the world's largest carbon capture facility in the world. The captured CO2 is used food packing, dry ice and beverage carbonation.\nThis project has very low capture costs. The project broke ground July 2009. The Shanghai Shidongkou Second Power Plant had originally been developed, constructed and operated by the HIPDC before it was transferred to Huaneng in July 1997.

The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) is overlooking technology development and research and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is responsible for CCS policy. The Ministry of Science and Technology is developing long term CCS R&D strategy.\nBy the initial estimate of MOST China has following storage capacities:\n46 oil and gas reservoirs with a capacity to stora 7.2 billion toones of Co2\n68 un \u2013 mineable coal beds with methane recovery and capacity to store 12 billion tonnes of Co2\n24 saline aquifiers with the capacity to store 1,435 billion tonnes of Co2\nChina's Scientific and Technological actions on climate change were issued by MOST in 2007. MOST has been leading on drafting the Guide for CCS science and technology development. The Guide plans to determine the goal of CCS R&D in 2020 and 2030, to Identify major tasks for capture, storage, transportation, and utilization technology development etc.\nInternational Cooperation on CCS Activities in China:\nOther countries like United States, Australia, Japan, Canada and the EU support CCS initiatives in China.\nThe United States is funding a range of projects including \"Building Regulatory Capacity in China \u2013 Guidelines for Safe and Effective Carbon Capture and Storage\" and \"Promoting Better Use of Coal Mine Methane. The Obama administration has signalled its interest in scaling up cooperation on clean coal technologies including CCS. Peabody, a US company, is a partner in the Chinese GreenGen IGCC\/CCS project. China was one of the founder members of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF), a US-led initiative launched in 2003.\nAustralia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has developed a post-combustion carbon capture plant with China's Huaneng Group at the Gaobeidian Beijing plant \u2013 the first demonstration of its kind in China. Global CCS Institute of Australia has a strong interest in expanding CCS cooperation with China, building on the existing Australia-China Joint Coordination Group on Clean Coal Technology, established in 2007. In April 2008 Australia announced that it was going to invest AUS$20 million in cooperation in China.\nAt the EU-China Summit in 2005 the two sides established a Climate Change Partnership. One of the main objectives of this was to develop and demonstrate advanced, near-zero emissions coal (NZEC) technology through CCS by 2020 in China and the EU.

{"text":" Enhanced Oil Recovery.\nChina is a founding member of the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate Change (APP) and an active participant in its Cleaner Fossil Energy Taskforce.\nChina is a member of Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF). CSLF is a ministerial level international climate change initiative for the development of cost effective technologies for carbon capture and sequestration.\nCCS Research and Development Activities in China:\nThe current Chinese CCS-related projects are in cooperation with foreign partners and largely based on foreign investment. CCS projects are governed under Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). China has adequate capacity to store its CO2 emissions according to MOST and other studies related to CCS in China. The majority of emissions from large point sources can be stored in large deep saline formations at estimated transport and storage costs of less than $10\/tCO2 excluding monitoring costs.\nChina has the theoretical capacity to store the CO2 produced from its major point sources according to studies. According to studies:\nChina has storage capacity in excess of 2,300 billion tonnes CO2 in onshore basins, with deep saline-filled sedimentary basins accounting for over 99% of the total.\nThere are over 1620 large stationary CO2 point sources that emit a combined 3.89 billion tonnes CO2\/year and 91% are within 100 miles of a candidate deep geological storage formation;\nPreliminary analysis suggests that the majority of emissions from China's large CO2 point sources can be stored in large deep saline formations at estimated transport and storage costs of less than $10\/tCO2 (not including monitoring costs).\nChina's National Actions for low- carbon economic development:\nFrom 1990 onwards China began to give importance in climate change and participated in international efforts. China is promoting energy conservation and emission reduction. Also low \u2013 carbon development was proposed in China. China made official emission reduction commitment.\nSome of the China's actions for low \u2013 carbon economic development since 1990:\n1990: Chinese government sent delegation to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n1992: Chinese government signed UNFCCC.\n1998: China signed Kyoto protocol.\n2002: China ratified the Kyoto protocol, China integrated the climate issues in to the general strategy of constructing \"harmonious society and harmonious world\" in the 16th CPC National Congress.\n2006: In the 11th 5-year plan, the mandatory target to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 percent has been set; Ministry of Science and Technology, China National Meteorological Administration, National Development and Reform Commission, State Environmental Protection Administration jointed Publicized National Assessment Report on Climate Change.\n2007: The mid-term GHG emission reduction target was set in the APEC conference.\n2008: White paper entitled China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change was published.\n2009: 2.1 trillion yuan was devoted to energy conservation, emission reduction and environmental protection areas; Chinese government issued official document to implement Bali Roadmap, making clear China's stance on this issue and its willingness and determination to push forward positive outcomes in the Copenhagen conference; President Hu Jintao illustrated China's concrete measures to tackle climate change in the United Nations Summit on Climate Change.\n2010: China ratified the unbinding \"Copenhagen Accord\" reached in the United Nationals Climate Conference in December, 2009.\n2011: The UK has made an agreement with China to formally work together on low-carbon growth. China has set a national carbon intensity reduction target of 17% and intends to cut energy intensity by 16% by 2015.\nChina's 2020 goals fighting climate change:\nReduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 % compared with the level of 2005\nIncrease the share of non-fossil-fuel power (renewable energy, nuclear, etc.) to15% of the country's total primary energy consumption by 2020\nIncrease 40 million hectares of forest areas and forest volume by 1.3 billion cubic meters from the levels of 2005\nPromote the Green development, circular economy and low-carbon economy, strengthen R&D&D of climate-friendly technologies\nChina's perspectives on CCS:\nCCS is one of the potential important technological options to address climate change.\nThere still remain many difficulties in the development and deployment of CCS technology.\nTo promote the development of CCS international collaboration to be strengthened\nhttp:\/\/sequestration.mit.edu\/\nhttp:\/\/www.zeroco2.no\/\nhttp:\/\/www.co2captureandstorage.info\/\nhttp:\/\/www.germanwatch.org\/klima\/ccs-china.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.gassnova.no\/frontend\/files\/CONTENT\/CCSWorld\/Japan\/China_summary-issue5.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.nzec.info\/en\/\nhttp:\/\/www.iea"}

This mechanism of flow of funds from developed to developing countries could lead to reduction of carbon emissions and could also help in conserving the depleting biodiversity.\nDeforestation and Degradation:\nAround the world, forests are being destroyed at a rate of about thirteen million hectares a year and deforestation accounts for an estimated 17 \u2013 20% of all global emissions.\nGlobal deforestation was estimated at 13 million ha\/yr for 1990-2005 (FAO 2005) Deforestation and forest degradation result in substantial reductions in forest carbon stocks and increase in emissions.\nIPCC WG1 estimated emissions from deforestation since 1990s at 5.8 GtCO2\/ yr.\nRainforests provide a wide variety of ecosystems services, from regulating rainfall to purifying groundwater and keeping fertile soil from eroding; deforestation in one area can seriously damage food production and access to clean water for an entire region.\nDeforestation World Map:\nForests and other terrestrial carbon sinks play a vital role in preventing runaway climate change, soaking up a full 2.6 Gt of atmospheric carbon every year. The destruction of forests, therefore, not only emits carbon \u2013 a staggering 1.6 Gt a year, which severely impairs forests' capacity to absorb emissions from other sources \u2013 but also drastically reduces the amount of forested land available to act as a carbon sink in the future.\nRainforests are also a home and source of income for a huge number of people in Africa, Asia, and South America. Despite this, economic pressures frequently drive both local communities and national governments in the developing world to exploit these forests in ways that are unsustainable, clear-cutting vast areas for fuel, timber, mining, or agricultural land.\nAnother serious problem is forest degradation. This occurs when the structure or function of a forest is negatively affected by external factors such as fire, pests or pruning for firewood thereby reducing the forests ability to provide the services and products. Forest degradation is also a huge source of CO2 emissions.\nMain causes for forest degradation:\nThey are broadly classified into three main sources, they are Gathering fuel wood \u2013 Collecting the woods by individuals for local use and for commercial use in the urban areas directly as charcoals, Timber harvesting and Fire.\nSome of the methods to combat degradation include, reduced impact logging, integrated fire management, improved forest governance, fuel wood management and forest certification\nREDD Major Players:\nThe REDD activities are under taken by some NGO's, private sectors, national or local governments or any combination of these. The genuine actors of REDD, however, will be the populations whose livelihoods derive from forests.\nREDD is pushed strongly by the World Bank and the United Nations for setting up the bases for the carbon market and the legal and governance frameworks of countries receiving REDD. The World Banks Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, the UN-REDD Programme, and Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative are such e.g.\nIndigenous Peoples and forest-dependent communities will be the front liners of REDD, and the success of REDD activities will largely depend on their engagement.\nUNFCCC Discussions on REDD\nREDD was first discussed under the UNFCCC in 2005 at the eleventh Conference of the Parties (COP 11). Consideration of the issue has continued since that time. As well as discussions at the yearly COP and at biannual meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies, several UNFCCC workshops have been held: one in Rome, Italy in August 2006, another in Cairns, Australia in March 2007 and another in Tokyo, Japan in June 2008.\nKey issues discussed have included:\n\u2022 The causes of deforestation;\n\u2022 Policy tools for REDD, including bilateral and multilateral cooperation;\n\u2022 Ways to provide incentives for REDD, including financial mechanisms; and technical issues associated with measuring.\nREDD Benefits:\nCapacity building opportunities for local communities\nGreater financial flow into developing countries\nRestoration and rehabilitation of degraded forests\nSustaining\/ preserving ecosystem service"}

Carbon neutral buildings are buildings which are specifically engineered to release no GHG at all or to balance the GHG emissions they produce using GHG trades.\nDuring construction and operation, buildings release GHG in the atmosphere. GHG emissions associated with buildings construction are mainly coming from materials manufacturing, materials transport, demolition wastes transport, demolition wastes treatment etc.\nThe construction, renovation, and deconstruction of a typical building are on average responsible for the emissions of 1,000-1,500 kgCO2e\/m.\nGHG emissions from buildings are occurring due to electricity consumption, Consumption of fossil fuels on-site for the production of electricity, hot water, heat, etc., on-site waste water treatment, on-site solid wastes treatment, industrial processes housed in the buildings etc.\nStrategies adopted by carbon-neutral buildings to reduce GHG emissions during construction include:\nReduce quantity of materials used\nSelect materials with low emissions factors associated (e.g., recycled materials)\nSelect materials suppliers as close as possible from the construction site to reduce transport distances\nDivert demolition wastes to recycling instead of landfills or incineration\nTo reduce GHG emissions carbon neutral buildings normally adopt two methods ie by reducing energy consumption or by using 100% renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, biofuels, geothermal, wave and tidal etc.\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) headquarters in Nairobi has become the first carbon-neutral building in Africa by using solar power. A system of over 4,000 modules was installed on the roof of the new UNEP offices by German firm Energiebau Solarstromsysteme GmbH. The 515 kilowatt solar project was connected to the grid on February 21st, and is expected to generate more energy than the 1,200 employees in the building will need.\nSolar energy has been something the U.N. has been targeting in Africa for years. And now that the building's sustainable energy supply is online, it is the largest on-roof solar power system on the continent.\nAldo Leopold Foundation Headquarters, Fairfield (WI):\nThe Aldo Leopold Foundation Headquarters located in Fairfield, Wisconsin is the first LEED-platinum carbon neutral building. 30 percent of all building materials used on the project are from recycled materials. Also, this building include sustainable features like high efficiency, low \u2013 flow plumbing fixtures, Low-VOC adhesives, sealants, paints, flooring systems and composite wood products to improve air quality, Twenty three Solatube skylights on the second floor, Lighting fixtures equipped with occupancy sensors designed to turn off when there is no movement or noise for an extended period of time etc.\nKroon Hall, Yale University's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies:\nKroon Hall is Yale Universitie's greenest building. Rainwater harvesting system and cleansing pond, recycled, recyclable, sustainably harvested or manufactured nontoxic materials, natural light and ventilation, geothermal energy system, solar hot water heaters, rooftop solar panels facing south, solar heat gain in winter and natural lighting year round along the long unobstructed south-facing wall, recycling of demolition and construction waste are some of the sustainable features of Kroon Hall building.\nTo read more about Kroon Hall building visit http:\/\/environment.yale.edu\/k"}

It is shipped as a liquid under its own vapour pressure. It is generally transported as a liquefied compressed gas.\nIt has an octahedral geometry, consisting of six fluorine atoms attached to a central sulfur atom.\nIt is a hypervalent molecule \u2013 a molecule that contains one or more typical elements (group 1, 2, 13-18) formally bearing more than eight electrons in their valence shells.\nTypical for a non-polar gas, it is poorly soluble in water but soluble in non-polar organic solvents."}
{"text":" Sf6 is 5 times denser than air. It has a density of 6.12 g\/L at sea level conditions, which is considerably higher than the density of air.\nThe only industrial process currently in use is the synthesis of sulphur hexafluoride by allowing fluorine obtained by electrolysis to react with sulphur according to the exothermic reaction:\nS + 3F2 \u2192 SF6 [+ 262 kcal]\nDuring this reaction, a certain number of other fluorides of sulphur are formed, such as SF4, SF2, S2F2, S2F10, as well as impurities due to the presence of moisture, air and the carbon anodes used for the fluorine electrolysis. These by products are removed by various purification processes.\nThere is virtually no reaction chemistry for SF6. We can prepare it from the elements through \"exposure of S8 to F2\".\nThere are also other methods to prepare- Sulfur fluorides are cogenerated, but these are removed by heating the mixture to disproportionate any S2F10 [which is highly toxic, unlike SF6 are non poisonous and odourless] and then scrubbing the product with NaOH to destroy remaining SF4\n\"[S2F10 \u2013 SF4=SF6]\".\nProperties of SF6:\nMolecular Weight of SF6\nMolecular weight : 146.05 g\/mol\n5 times denser than air\nSpecific Gravity:\n5.11 @ 68 F\nSpecific Volume:\n2.5 cu.ft.\/lb @ 70 F\nSolid phase- Latent heat of Fusion\nLatent heat of fusion (1,013 bar, at triple point) : 39.75 kJ\/kg\nLiquid phase\nLatent heat of vaporization (1.013 bar at boiling point) : 162.2 kJ\/kg\nVapour pressure (at 21 \u00b0C or 70 \u00b0F) : 21.5 bar\nLiquid density (at triple point) : 1880 kg\/m3\nBoiling point (Sublimation) : -63.9 \u00b0C\nGaseous phase\nGas density (1.013 bar and 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F)) : 6.27 kg\/m3\nHeat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) (1.013 bar and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F)) : 0.097 kJ\/(mol.K)\nCompressibility Factor (Z) (1.013 bar and 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F)) : 0.9884\nSpecific gravity (air = 1) (1.013 bar and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F)) : 5.114\nViscosity (1.013 bar and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F)) : 0.000142 Poise\nThermal conductivity (1.013 bar and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F)) : 12.058 mW\/(m.K)\nSpecific volume (1.013 bar and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F)) : 0.156 m3\/kg\nCritical pressure : 37.59 bar\nCritical temperature : 45.5 \u00b0C\nTriple point\nTriple point temperature : -49.4 \u00b0C\nTriple point pressure : 2.26 bar\nSolubility in water (20 \u00b0C and 1 bar) : 0.007 vol\/vol\nGreen House Gas Concerns of SF6:\nSF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 22,800 times that of CO2. SF6 is an anthropogenically produced compound, mainly used as a gaseous dielectric in gas insulated switchgear power installations. Given the low amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2 percent. Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived \u2013 they remain in the atmosphere for longer period than any other compound. SF6 acting as green house gas can have a heavy impact on the Global climate, and its concentration in the earth atmosphere is rapidly increasing. It is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere and has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800\u20133200 years. Sf6's anthropogenic sources are di- electric mediums.\nHealth and Physiological effects:\nDuring its working cycle, SF6 decomposes under electrical stress, forming toxic by-products that are a health threat for working personnel in the event of exposure. The danger with sulfur hexafluoride is that the degeneration products can be toxic, causing nausea and vomiting, pulmonary symptoms, and transient atelectasis. It may be contaminated with other fluorides of sulfur, such as sulfur pentafluoride and disulfur decafluoride, which are extremely toxic and are respiratory irritants. The gas can be inhaled in a small, safe amount and cause the breather's voice to sound"}

June 2018, CentraleSupelec, Paris)\nThe fifth report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that the increase in global average surface temperature is due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The report also reveals that keeping the average global temperature below a 2\u00b0 increase will become more challenging over time. Despite the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the submission of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 164 Parties, most countries still need to urgently transform their NDCs to specific measures and actions. At the same time, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also part of a new Agenda that will shift the world onto a more sustainable and resilient path. These initiatives have created an opportunity for the design and implementation of policies that will address sustainable development and climate change simultaneously.\nTransport is responsible for about 25% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a dominating greenhouse gas (GHG), with an increasing share in most countries, especially in Asia and Latin America. According to the International Transport Forum (ITF), the transport sector remains the sector with the fastest growing CO2 emissions compared to the industry and energy sectors in the OECD countries. Although transport CO2 emission levels in non-OECD countries are still relatively low, they will soon catch up with OECD countries. In addition, developing countries also have high levels of local air pollution, particularly sulfur oxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulate matter (PM), which is a pressing priority for most cities.\nGlobal transport volumes have been projected to continue to increase. Passenger transport will more than double by 2050, the global vehicle stock will increase from 1 billion in 2015 to 2.4 billion in 2050, while freight transport is projected to triple. Global transport CO2emission could increase by 60% from 2015 level in 2050 under the business as usual scenario. However, having the appropriate mix of policies can significantly reduce carbon emissions, create transport co-benefits that will also decrease local air pollution and provide options for low carbon transport development. This conference seeks to identify priority areas that will have the greatest potential to reduce transport emissions in both passenger and freight transport and to share knowledge on best practice and latest research findings on emerging trends.\nThis conference is organized by the World Conference on Transport Research Society (WCTRS) Special Interest Group (SIG) f2 on Transport, Climate Change and Clean Air. The focus of the conference is on current transport, climate change and local air pollution research, including the application of scientific methods on impact assessment or evaluation that will provide policy insights on efficient mitigation and adaptation measures for the transport sector. Such measures will include changes in various types of policies and mobility patterns, as well as technological innovations and disruptions. References to ongoing political discussions on all modes are highly welcomed.\nThe objective of this call is to have about 20 high-quality scientific presentations and fruitful discussions within each thematic field with national and international experts. Key outcomes from the discussions will be drafted as inputs to the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue, which is a facilitative dialogue whose inputs will be synthesized and presented at COP 24. It will contribute to the UNFCCC process to enhance Parties' ambition and help Parties with the preparation of NDCs.\nTwo outstaning researchers will give a keynote speech to set the scene and highlight GHG mitigation potentials, as well as further"}

Like on facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/EmpoweringNewEnergy Follow on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheNewEnergyInd While we wait I am going to show you something else that Is pretty cool. If we take a magnet where the front of the magnet is north and the back of the magnet is south (north has an X, south does not have an X), if we put the magnets together North, North, North, the repel each other, they do not go together. They create a force between the magnetic flux lines and they repel each other. Whereas, if we put the magnets together North, South, North, and we alternate them, they want to stick together quite nicely. If we take magnets north, north, north, and we continue this sequence and we wrap them around a ring, much like this for example, to where all of the norths are in and all of the souths are out. That creates a \"vortex of magnetic flux lines\" going in, to where the magnetic flux lines all come in, create pressure within themselves, self rotate and then then coming out into the south of the magnet. This is the Top View and then the Side View is this, where the magnets go around, and the vortex (like this) comes out and then goes back in. So this is essentially a \"Vortexing Magnetic Field\". Now, what is the significance of that??? If we take a vortexing magnetic field and we stick it on top of a static magnetic field, what do you think will happen? It will create spin, it will create motion without actually touching each other. The vortexing magnetic field will create spin within this magnet, and I will show you that right now. This is a steel ball bearing. This is a speaker magnet, and these are also little speaker magnets. All of the North magnetic fields are facing inwards, and that creates a \"vortexing magnetic Field\". If we put it over this, it spins. This could be scaled up, precision engineered with high powered magnets to create a \"New Energy Device\", whereas this is just a cardboard tube and speaker magnets that I got from the store, taped and rubber banded. But still, it proves the concept that motion exists naturally in the universe. I am going to do it one more time then we are going to get back to the plasma. So that is the nature of the universe - to spin. If you think about why a Galaxy rotates, or why the Earth rotates, or why the Solar System rotates, or why an Atom rotates, that is the fundamental question that will explain what is going on in this plasma reactor here.\nNew Energy Field Camera - See INFRAREADY.CO.UK for details \/ prices.

{"text":"Q\nThe earth itself vibrates as a resonance of 7.83Hz and better known as the \"Schumann Resonance. MP3 available for sale HERE: https:\/\/powerthoughtsmeditationclub.dpdcart.com\/cart\/add?product_id=134604&method_id=143753 This vibration is considered the natural state of everything. Brainwaves 7.83 Hz - Schumann earth resonance. Grounding, meditative - Pure Binaural Beats (The Frequency of the Earth) Our hearing range is 20 - 20000Hz. This is a 7,83Hz binaural beat. Binaural beats are created by having to different frequencies in stereo (one left and one right), where the difference between the two create one frequency together. Here\u00b4s an example: the left frequency is set to lets say 170hz, and the right frequency is set to 177, 83hz. The difference between the two (177,83 - 170 = 7,83) creates the frequency of the binaural beat. 170Hz is a frequency we easily can hear. Binaural beats can be created at a lower or higher frequencies than this within the 20Hz - 20000Hz range. So if we took 528Hz on the left, and 532 Hz on the right, we would create a 4Hz theta binaural beat. Hope this info clears up any confusion.

Grounding, meditative, Leaves you revitalized Is it possible to turn color into sound? Theoretically and poetically, it is. Practically? YES!!! That's exactly what we did in this video... and guess what, we got a perfect match!!! After we turned wavelength interval to frequency interval, we got musical tones that perfectly matched colors that are traditionaly used to represent 7 chakras. Manipura or manipuraka is symbolised by a downward pointing triangle with ten petals, along with the color yellow. The seed syllable is Ram, and the presiding deity is Braddha Rudra, with Lakini as the Shakti. Manipura is related to the metabolic and digestive systems. Manipura is believed to correspond to Islets of Langerhans, which are groups of cells in the pancreas, as well as the outer adrenal glands and the adrenal cortex. These play a valuable role in digestion, the conversion of food matter into energy for the body. The colour that corresponds to Manipura is yellow. Key issues governed by Manipura are issues of personal power, fear, anxiety, opinion-formation, introversion, and transition from simple or base emotions to complex. Physically, Manipura governs digestion, mentally it governs personal power, emotionally it governs expansiveness, and spiritually, all matters of growth. Corresponding deity for material element of this chakra is Agni. The Schumann resonances (SR) are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere.................................

They were broadcast on 18 March 2011 as part of BBC One's Red Nose Day telethon for the charity Comic Relief. The two mini-episodes were written by the programme's head writer Steven Moffat and directed by Richard Senior.\nThe episodes form a two-part story, set entirely within the TARDIS, starring Matt Smith as The Doctor, and Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill as married couple Amy Pond and Rory Williams. Rory, helping the Doctor work on the TARDIS, looks up the glass floor surrounding the console and becomes distracted by Amy's short skirt, causing him to drop the thermal couplings he was holding. This causes the three to be stuck in a \"space loop\" where the TARDIS materialises inside of the TARDIS.\n\"Space\" and \"Time\" were filmed in two days alongside the sixth series DVD Night and the Doctor extras \"Bad Night\" and \"Good Night\". The episodes are intended to show what life aboard the TARDIS would be like. Several editing techniques and doubles were used for the various shots where there were more than one of the same character on the screen. The mini-episodes received mixed reviews; some scenes were thought to be funny, but other jokes were criticised for relying on sexist humour. \"Space\" and \"Time\" were later released on the DVD and Blu-ray sets of the sixth series.\nThis page contains text from Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia -\thttps:\/\/wn.com\/Space___Time\nIn physics, spacetime is any mathematical model that combines space and time into a single interwoven continuum. The spacetime of our universe has historically been interpreted from a Euclidean space perspective, which regards space as consisting of three dimensions, and time as consisting of one dimension, the \"fourth dimension\". By combining space and time into a single manifold called Minkowski space, physicists have significantly simplified a large number of physical theories, as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the universe at both the supergalactic and subatomic levels.\nIn non-relativistic classical mechanics, the use of Euclidean space instead of spacetime is appropriate, because time is treated as universal with a constant rate of passage that is independent of the state of motion of an observer. In relativistic contexts"}

Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating\/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.\nBased on REN21's 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to humans' global energy consumption and 22 percent to their generation of electricity in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.

This will be realised through more reliable and improved, shared insights about consumption based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThe project also quantitatively analysed the added value of consumption-oriented climate mitigating policies. Through this, it aimed to encourage a more effective policy mix for achieving the objectives of the EU Climate and Energy package, and the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050.\nClimate policies are formulated on national or regional level and differ in stringency and approach. This reflects differences in economic development, political culture and will. They further mainly focus on production sectors. Yet growing consumption is a main driver behind rising GHG emissions.\nFurther, our economy is increasingly a single, global economy and international trade has risen threefold since 1990. Current climate policies are mainly shaped via territorial emission reduction methods with approaches from a consumption oriented perspective that have added value:\nConsumption-and trade oriented policies can explicitly address issues such as carbon leakage. They can also identify situations where an apparent reduction of GHG emissions in a country is mainly the result of structural change (for example, when carbon intensive industries have been relocated abroad).\nSuch policies more directly address consumption as a driver for rising GHG emissions.\nComplementing existing policies and initiatives (Energy 2020, Kyoto Protocol, Energy Roadmap 2050 etc.), consumption\u2013based carbon emission accounts (CBCA) and consumption-based and trade related climate policy (CBTP) offer a possibility to address and partially mitigate the effect of differences in national climate policies. They can do so by taking into account GHG emissions during the entire life cycle of consumed products and services.\nThe life-cycle perspective has already been adopted widely and significantly shaped policy at the micro-level. Mitigation policies that include complementary consumption and trade components thus bear the promise of providing more balanced cost-effective and efficient solutions compared to a focus on production alone. It may also be possible to identify and stimulate low-impact consumption patterns with no lower or even higher quality life, both in developed and emerging economies.\nClimate Stratgies role is to establish interaction and mutual learning processes between the project team and external stakeholders. These include experts and policy makers from UNFCCC, IPCC, other regions in the world with different stages of development, and key players from relevant sectors of the economy.\nIn light of this, Climate Strategies has performed a series of brokerage activities to secure policy impact through dissemination and consultations with key developing and developed countries researchers, policy makers, organisations, businesses and industries.\nConsortium members: TNO, University of Leiden, University of Cambridge, University College London, Climate Strategies, DIW Berlin, NTNU, Vienna University of Economics, ICTSD, Cambridge Econometrics, IPTS.\nProject Leader: Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)\nFor further information, please visit the official project website.\n*The Carbon-CAP project receives funding from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No 603386."}

This past May 24, an overwhelming majority in the Chamber of Deputies voted in favor of a bill to relax its requirements with regard to forest conservation. The bill is currently under study in the Senate. [Update Dec 28 2011]\nA detailed study conducted in the municipality of Apu\u00ed along the Transamazon Highway in Amazonas found that many families in the region earned little income from cattle.\nInstead, they were clearing the land in order to claim land titles to sell the land to large corporate ranchers, according to the study \"Forest Clearing Dynamics and the Expansion of Landholdings in Apu\u00ed, a Deforestation Hotspot on Brazil's Transamazon Highway\", published in the journal Ecology and Society in June.\nFrom the early 1990s the population of Apu\u00ed has tripled, and the municipality has had some of the highest rates of deforestation in all of the state of Amazonas. Approximately 90 per cent of the area has been converted into pasture, the study found.\n\"These families are always moving into new forest areas to deforest so they can claim land title.

The chicks die of malnutrition, and when their bodies decay all those plastic bottle tops, disposable lighters, and the ubiquitous bits of plastic detritus get back into the environment in a cruel perversion of'recycling'.\nThere is now so much plastic in the oceans it is likely that virtually every seabird has plastic in its belly if its feeding habits mean it mistakes plastic bits for food. The same is true for sea turtles, marine animals or fish, experts say.\nNorthern fulmars, a common seabird numbering in the millions, have a collective 45 tonnes worth of plastic bits in their bellies, estimates Jan Andries van Franeker, a biologist with the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies at the University of Wageningen in Holland.\nAt least 95 percent of fulmars in the North Sea where van Franeker has been working for three decades have one to several dozen bits of plastic in their stomachs. The same is true for related species like the tiny Wilson's storm petrels, which unknowingly transport an estimated 35 tonnes of plastic from their wintering grounds in the North Atlantic to breeding grounds in the Antarctic, he says.\n\"If a seabird's"}

Canada and Alaska will soon follow, the regional study shows.\n\"If one is sincerely committed to limit global temperature increase to below two degrees C\u2026 (governments) committing to a global peak emission level and peak year makes sense from a science perspective,\" said Joeri Rogelj of the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich, who headed the analysis published Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change. [See NCC editorial \"Crossing the threshold\"]\nGovernments will be meeting in Durban, South Africa starting Nov. 28 to launch the next round of climate treaty negotiations, which so far have failed to ensure their goal of less than a two-degree C increase will be achieved.\nIPS asked Rogelj if government delegates in Durban ought to set a specific year by which global emissions will peak and then decline to ensure the two-degree C target will be met.\n\"Committing to such targets would ensure that we embark globally on a technologically and economically feasible low-emission path,\" Rogelj said.\nRogelj and a group of leading experts show in this state-of-the-art analysis that to have a 66-percent or better probability of staying below two degrees C this century, global carbon emissions must peak before 2020. Global emissions ought to be around 44 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020. That is four billion tonnes (also called gigatonnes, Gt) less than the estimated emissions for 2010.\nAfter 2020 emissions must decline rapidly, about two to three percent less each year until they fall to 20 Gt by 2050, according to the computer models. This is an emissions \"pathway that will be very challenging to achieve\", Rogelj and colleagues conclude in their study.\n\"Very challenging\" is scientist-talk for something that will be extremely difficult to do. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that 80 percent of projected emissions from the power sector in 2020 are already locked in, as they will come from power plants that are currently in place or under construction today.\n\"This significant increase in CO2 emissions and the locking in of future emissions due to infrastructure investments represent a serious setback to our hopes of limiting the global rise in temperature to no more than two degrees C,\" said Dr. Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA, last May.

{"text":" it wants to be the world's first zero-carbon emissions country by 2020. With little renewable energy at present and dependent on foreign aid, the Cook Islands plans to generate half of its energy with renewables just four years from now and reach 100 percent by 2020.\nIPS senior environmental correspondent Stephen Leahy spoke with Prime Minister Puna at the Vienna Energy Forum in June, where 1,200 delegates from 120 countries and over 40 government ministers discussed how to bring clean, reliable and affordable energy services to everyone on the planet.\nExcerpts from the interview follow.\nQ: The Cook Islands have a tiny carbon footprint. Why are you making this commitment to be 100-percent renewable?\nA: Statistically, our carbon emissions don't register. As a people we want to do something about climate change, if not for the world than for ourselves.\nNearly all of our energy comes from oil [diesel and petrol] and we spend half of our national budget on oil. That's tens of millions of dollars that leaves our islands. We want to keep those millions in our local economy. Cook Islanders people are strongly supportive of our dream is to be the cleanest and greenest destination in the world. One day the world will want to know how we got to 100 percent.\nQ: Are you hopeful the international community will finally agree to make the necessary carbon emissions cuts to keep global warming to less than two degrees C?\nA: The reality is that things move very slowly at the international level. At the [Vienna] forum, I urged the international community to ensure that global carbon emissions peak by 2015 and begin to decline. We need to act fast. This is the decade where we must bring emissions of climate change under control.\nOur circumstances differ, we have different life experiences\u2026.but we are all part of Mother Earth and should share responsibility to keep her livable for all of us and not just for some.\nQ: Are Cook Islanders worried about climate change?\nA: The Cooks are already suffering from sea level rise, coral bleaching, more frequent and stronger cyclones, changes in precipitation, and increases in coastal erosion. We live off the sea and the land \u2013 we depend on nature for our livelihoods. Anything affecting nature causes alarm amongst people. Climate change threatens our very survival. There is a general sense of apprehension about the future.\nQ: What makes you believe you can achieve your ambitious target?\nA: Yesterday, I visited G\u00fcssing [in Austria], an impoverished town in the 1990s that re-made itself by going 100-percent renewable energy. They got rid of fossil fuels and achieved energy independence. They also attracted lots of clean and green businesses and become a tourist centre.\nI spent time with the mayor. They're going to come to the Cooks and give us advice. They are willing to share their experience. I'm absolutely excited by this.\nQ: Your country has few financial resources. Do you really think the Cooks can do what G\u00fcssing has done?\nA: It's a small town and we're a small country. What I learned from G\u00fcssing is that if there is the political will backed by public support, then anything can happen. We already have a plan for a two- megawatt solar plant in one of our islands. We have support from Japan, New Zealand and UNDP [the United Nations Development Programme].\nQ: What are some of the obstacles you have to overcome?\nA: The technology to generate all of our energy already exists but energy storage is the key. We also need to make sure some of this will be able to be used and maintained by isolated communities without the technical skills.\nQ: Any final thoughts?\nA: Knowing we are taking action helps us feel good even if the world does nothing. We're not doing this just for the Cook Islands. It is our contribution to improve the overall global environment.\nFirst published as Q&A: Cook Islands Aims for 100 Percent Green Energy by 2020 \u2013 IPS ipsnews.net.\nGov'ts Fail to Invest in Hungriest, Poorest Regions Creating Crisis After Crisis\n20\/12\/2011 18\/12\/2011 Stephen 1 Must Read, Africa, CLIMATE CHANGE\/GLOBAL WARMING, Food, Global Issues and Perspectives, Indigenous People, News, water\tChangwon, Ethiopia, Horn Africa, Horn of Africa, hunger, Kenya, poverty, Somalia, South Korea, UNCCD, UNDP, UNICEF\nCHANGWON, South Korea, Oct 21, 2011 (IPS)\nFor millennia, people have coped with drought in the Horn of Africa, comprised mainly of drylands.

Why? They simply cannot afford to buy enough food. World food prices remain 15 percent higher than a year ago, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Food commodity speculation and climatic change that is bringing increased heat and changes in precipitation patterns, along with increasing demand for biofuels, have been blamed for rising food prices in recent years.\nLargely unseen in the growing concern about feeding the world is the decline in the fertility of soils due to erosion and overuse. Every year, this results in the effective loss of some 12 million hectares of land.

{"text":"The Woody Meadow Project is a unique research collaboration between the Universities of Sheffield and Melbourne and the City of Melbourne. It seeks to create urban plantings that are diverse and attractive yet require minimal maintenance.\nThe Woody Meadow's structure and character is defined by three layers: base, bump and emergent.\nResearch used to create the Olympic Park meadow in London is now informing research here in Australia. The Woody Meadow Project is pioneered by Dr Audrey Gerber and Professor James Hitchmough at the University of Sheffield in England and is now a joint research project with the University of Melbourne and the City of Melbourne. It is headed by John Rayner and Dr Claire Farrell from the university's School of the Ecosystem and Forest Sciences, along with research assistant Leanne Hanrahan and Master of Urban Horticulture student Ahmed Ashraf. The Melbourne-based project is also being supported by the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and the Trawalla Foundation.\nThe Woody Meadow research project has been developed in the context of other innovative City of Melbourne initiatives, such as the 2013 Wild Flower Meadow at Birrarung Marr, the 2014 Melbourne BioBlitz citizen science program and the 2016 Draft Urban Ecology and Biodiversity Strategy, which understands the city as an ecosystem, seeking to connect people to nature, protect and enhance healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, and demonstrate local and global leadership.\nIn 1993, after working in Australia for ten years, Hitchmough returned to the UK and alongside Gerber, evaluated and ranked 1,200 Australian shrubs for their suitability for woody meadow plantings. With input from Australian researchers, a shortlist of 287 species was developed in consideration of their cultivation and likely responses to coppicing, response to stresses like drought, and exposure to extreme temperatures and wind. The woody meadows are essentially atypical shrub plantings that focus on high ornamental value; multi-species floriferous shrubs that are long-flowering and designed biologically to sprout again after the canopy has been removed (a plant category known as post-fire re-sprouters). \"They can regrow from basal buds after disturbances such as herbivory or fire,\"1 says Rayner. The local meadow designs have been modelled on natural heathland plant communities found across southern Australia.\nCoppicing experiments were undertaken at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne back in September 2015, with further plot testing at Burnley and Cranbourne in October 2015. Still in an early establishment phase, the two-hundred-square-metre plot \u2013 along one of Birrarung Marr's main paths toward Melbourne's sports precinct \u2013 combines with other experimental plots on the Capital City Trail near Royal Park Public Golf Course, planted in September 2016. The test beds include almost four thousand plants from twenty-one different species.\nSeen as self-gardening gardens, these constructed landscapes are intended to improve Melbourne's liveability. They are intended to become destinations in their own right for local and international tourists, and enhance the everyday experience of workers and residents on their diurnal walk or cycling commute.\nRayner suggests that a key challenge is how little we know \"about the ability of plants to thrive in designed and mixed plant communities \u2026 how they will respond to coppicing and how their growth might be affected by strongly modified soils, hydrology and microclimates.\"4 Another challenge may be gauging the public's response to the woody meadow after coppicing, educating the cultured eye to the expression of Australian landscape processes.\nIn 2006 the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment described ecosystem services as \"the benefits people obtain from ecosystems,\"7 defined by four services categories that correlate to human wellbeing: supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services. Ecosystem services have, however, been criticized for being anthropocentric and placing too much emphasis on the economic value of landscapes. It is in this context that the City of Melbourne is seeking to increase the attractiveness and biodiversity of urban landscapes without the exorbitant labour and resource costs typically required by display plantings.\nThe Woody Meadow Project seeks to better connect people to their environment while testing both economic and less tangible benefits. It is through the project's understanding of the interdependency of social and natural systems that it may instead go by the moniker of a high-performance landscape. But in the epoch of the Anthropocene, the next approach may need to be altogether non-anthropocentric.\n1.

While detailed data is not yet available, the convincing majority suggests some major funds joined sustainable investment activists after the same proposal won 38% of the vote last year.\nComing amid reports president Donald Trump plans to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, it signalled that concern about climate change is stronger than ever in financial circles.\n\"Investors voting against management at Exxon is a powerful rebuke to the climate denialist policies of this White House,\" said Raj Thamotheram, head of thinktank Preventable Surprises. \"Markets are moving and corporate America would be foolish to bet so much on the protection from this regime.\"\nThe resolution requires Exxon to disclose how the international goal to hold global warming below 2C \u2013 as agreed in Paris \u2013 could dampen future demand for its oil and gas.\nThinktank Carbon Tracker estimated in 2015 that Exxon was planning to sink $72 billion over the next decade into developing fuel reserves that would be surplus to the requirements of a 2C world.\nDespite Trump's apparent refusal to honour the Paris Agreement, advances in clean technology and policy action elsewhere have convinced some other oil majors to start adjusting their expectations.\nWeekly briefing: Sign up for your essential climate news update\nDuring the AGM, Exxon chief executive Darren Woods reiterated his company's support for the Paris Agreement and call for a revenue-neutral carbon tax to meet climate goals. But management opposed shareholder demands for more transparency, insisting none of Exxon's reserves would be \"stranded\" in the global shift to clean energy.\nWoods promised to \"step back and reflect\" after the result was announced.\nThe Church of England and New York State public pension fund, which led the shareholder rebellion, described Wednesday's victory as \"historic\" and \"unprecedented\".\nEdward Mason, head of responsible investment for Church Commissioners, said in a statement: \"Despite strong opposition from the Board, the majority of Exxon's shareholders have sent an unequivocal signal to the company that it must do much more to disclose the impact on its business of measures to combat climate change.\"\n\"Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,\" added New York State comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. \"The burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.\"\nIt piles the pressure on Exxon at the same time as it faces multiple lawsuits over allegations it deliberately cast doubt on the scientific consensus around climate change, even as its internal research confirmed it.\nGrassroots campaign network 350.org has consistently argued that engaging with Exxon is futile and shareholders should take their money elsewhere.\n\"Exxon's climate lies are finally catching up with them,\" said Jamie Henn, strategic communications director at 350, ahead of the vote.\n\"Any real climate risk assessment will show that Exxon's drill-baby-drill business plan is incompatible with a liveable planet.

{"text":"Water oxidation advance boosts potential for solar fuel\nPublished: Thursday, March 11, 2010 - 14:33 in Physics & Chemistry\nPhoto by Benjamin Yin, Emory University\nEmory University chemists have developed the most potent homogeneous catalyst known for water oxidation, considered a crucial component for generating clean hydrogen fuel using only water and sunlight. The breakthrough, published March 11 in the journal Science, was made in collaboration with the Paris Institute of Molecular Chemistry. The fastest, carbon-free molecular water oxidation catalyst (WOC) to date \"has really upped the standard from the other known homogeneous WOCs,\" said Emory inorganic chemist Craig Hill, whose lab led the effort. \"It's like a home run compared to a base hit.\"\nIn order to be viable, a WOC needs selectivity, stability and speed. Homogeneity is also a desired trait, since it boosts efficiency and makes the WOC easer to study and optimize. The new WOC has all of these qualities, and it is based on the cheap and abundant element cobalt, adding to its potential to help solar energy go mainstream.\nBenjamin Yin, an undergraduate student in Hill's lab, is the lead author on the Science paper. Emory chemists who are co-authors include Hill, Yurii Gueletii, Jamal Musaev, Zhen Luo and Ken Hardcastle. The U.S. Department of Energy funded the work.\nThe WOC research is a component of the Emory Bio-inspired Renewable Energy Center, which aims to mimic natural processes such as photosynthesis to generate clean fuel. The next step involves incorporating the WOC into a solar-driven, water-splitting system.\nThe long-term goal is to use sunlight to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen becomes the fuel. Its combustion produces the by-product of water \u2013 which flows back into a clean, green, renewable cycle.\nThree main technical challenges are involved: developing a light collector, a catalyst to oxidize water to oxygen and a catalyst to reduce water to hydrogen. All three components need improvement, but a viable WOC may be the most difficult scientific challenge. \"We are aiming for a WOC that is free of organic structure, because organic components will combine with oxygen and self-destruct,\" Hill says. \"You'll wind up with a lot of gunk.\"\nEnzymes are nature's catalysts. The enzyme in the oxygen-evolving center of green plants \"is about the least stable catalyst in nature, and one of the shortest lived, because it's doing one of the hardest jobs,\" Hill says.\n\"We've duplicated this complex natural process by taking some of the essential features from photosynthesis and using them in a synthetic, carbon-free, homogeneous system. The result is a water oxidation catalyst that is far more stable than the one found in nature.\"\nFor decades, scientists have been trying to imitate Mother Nature and create a WOC for artificial photosynthesis. Nearly all of the more than 40 homogeneous WOCs developed by labs have had significant limitations, such as containing organic components that burn up quickly during the water oxidation process.\nTwo years ago, Hill's lab and collaborators developed the first prototype of a stable, homogenous, carbon-free WOC, which also worked faster than others known at the time. The prototype, however, was based on ruthenium, a relatively rare and expensive element.\nBuilding on that work, the researchers began experimenting with the cheaper and more abundant element cobalt. The cobalt-based WOC has proved even faster than the ruthenium version for light-driven water oxidation.\nSource: Emory University\nThu, 11 Mar 2010, 20:35:25 UTC\nhomogeneous catalyst\noxidation catalyst\nrenewable energy center\nwater oxidation"}

{"text":"Wisconsin lawmakers weary of wind setback issue\nFrom an article by Dan Haugen on Midwest Energy News:\nWisconsin's politically contested wind-turbine siting rules would quietly go back on the books if the state's legislature doesn't take up the issue this session.\nWhile it's premature for wind energy supporters to declare victory, the rules' opponents appear to have little appetite for reopening the controversy, according to observers.\n\"This is an issue they don't want to have anything to do with right now,\" says Michael Vickerman, director of Renew Wisconsin, a renewable energy advocacy group. \"It's kind of reached the radioactive phase.\"\nThe first-in-the-nation rules were aimed at streamlining the messy, often shifting patchwork of local setback rules, which govern the distance wind developers need to leave between turbines and adjacent homes. A 2009 law instructed regulators to comes up with a statewide setback policy. After two years of hearings and debate, they issued rules restricting turbines from within 1,250 feet of neighboring residences.\nOn the day the rules were to take effect last March, however, a Republican-controlled legislative committee voted along party lines to suspend the statewide rules. Gov. Scott Walker instead proposed an 1,800-foot setback from the nearest property line, which the American Wind Energy Association said would essentially shut down the state's wind industry.\nSince then, wind developers have cited regulatory uncertainty in suspending or canceling five major developments totaling $1.6 billion in economic investment. Vickerman says wind energy supporters have successfully highlighted the economic consequences of Walker's action, which is why party leadership seems to have lost interest in the fight.\n\"These guys are afraid because the issue has boomeranged on them,\" says Vickerman. \"Scott Walker does not really want to be known as someone who has killed jobs by basically shutting down the commercial wind industry in Wisconsin, and neither do the legislative leaders.\"\nLabels: Energy Policy, Western Wisconsin, Wind\nRenewable Energy Touted for Value on Earth Day\nPierce County wind farm plan still in limbo\nSmall Businesses Request Resumption of Renewable E...\nPSC must establish wind energy rules"}

The city has a population of 80,000 and it is near Egyptian border.\nLast month, ISIS had declared Derna as part of its Caliphate and ISIS caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi became its leader.\nMeanwhile, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia has also started showing Derna as part of the Islamic State. On its site, Wikipedia mentions Derna as a part of Islamic State (de facto; as a matter of fact) while it belongs to Libya according to law (de jure).\nIn its report of Tuesday, CNN says that fighters loyal to ISIS are now in complete control of the city of Derna, which is just 200 miles from the southern shores of the European Union (EU).\nIn fact, EU and Libya are so close that EU has established an integrated Border Management Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya) which supports the Libyan authorities in developing border management and security at the country's land, sea, and air borders.\nHowever, as ISIS has indicated, it is expected to soon invade some areas of Europe. The U.S. is already apprehensive of ISIS' unchecked strides that are advancing toward Europe.\nIn a recent issue of its Dabiq magazine, ISIS has quoted U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel : \"While ISIL (ISIL is the American term for ISIS) clearly poses an immediate threat to American citizens in Iraq and our interests in the Middle East, we also know that thousands of foreign fighters, including Europeans and more than 100 Americans have travelled to Syria. With passports that give them relative freedom of movement, these fighters can exploit ISIL's safe haven to plan, coordinate and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe.\"\nOn Sunday, ISIS had beheaded a U.S. aid worker Abdul-Rahman (formerly Peter) Kassig. After the beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Kassig is the third American hostage executed by ISIS in the past few months.\nMoreover, ISIS has decided to produce its own currency in the form of gold, silver, and copper coins to be called Islamic Dinars. It will use this currency in the areas under its control.\nBy Rakesh Raman, the managing editor of RMN Company\nYou also can read: More Articles by the RMN Editor, Rakesh Raman\nPhoto courtesy: Dabiq\nSupport RMN News Service for Independent Fearless Journalism\nIn today's media world controlled by corporates and politicians, it is extremely difficult for independent editorial voices to survive.

{"text":"France CR RepTrak is a survey based on more than 38,000 ratings from the Informed General Public in France, collected in January-February 2018. It ranks French and multi-national companies based on their performance in Corporate Responsibility (CR).\nAt RI, we define CR as performance in the dimensions of Citizenship, Governance, and Workplace. This data helps companies understand the state of corporate responsibility globally and by country, their standing in it, as well as how corporate responsibility directly impacts business results.\nAmong the top 10, Netflix joins the list as a new company. Google, Siemens, Barilla and Canon rise up the rank to join the top 10, while BIC, Philips, Colgate-Palmolive, Metro AG, Rolex, and Danone drop down in ranks.\nThe most reputable company in France for 2018 is also the company with the highest CR score. Ranked number 1 two years in a row, Decathlon is also the only company to be in the top 3 for the three dimensions of CR: Citizenship, Governance, and Workplace.\nIn 2018 Groupe SEB drops from 2nd to 4th place in CR with a reputation score of 69.3. Across the three dimensions of CR, Groupe SEB is one of the top companies in the area of Workplace. Digging deeper into the attributes of CR, SEB is perceived as being fair in the way it does business and its positive influence in society. This aligns with SEBs efforts to be a good corporate citizen by focusing on sustainable innovation in all aspects of its business.\nSince 2012 Danone's CR score has fluctuated between the strong and average range, and in 2018 it lands in the latter in 18th place. Although Danone stands out for its good Citizenship, it is a company that hasn't received full recognition among the General Public for its efforts in CR (ex. One Planet, One Health initiative in 2017).\nNevertheless, among those respondents who are aware of Danone's work in CR, the company sees a reputational and CR payoff. Specifically, among those familiar with Danone's latest efforts towards sustainable and healthy farming methods, Journ\u00e9e du 21 Septembre 'Je sais, J'agis,' Danone has a 5.3-point lift in its CR index and a 4.4-point lift in reputation.\nThe General Public is demanding that companies serve a greater purpose beyond their products and services. To earn and maintain a strong to excellent reputation, organizations must deliver on social, fiscal, environmental, and employer of choice status. With these growing demands, we find that reputation is less about Corporate Social Responsibility and more about a holistic approach to Corporate Responsibility. The social part, by itself, is restrictive. Yes, organizations are pressed to do the right thing in the social arena, but increasingly in other key areas as well.\nIn France, CR specifically accounts for 43.2% of a company's reputation. Companies that deliver on sustainable development goals (SDGs) and sustainable, social, and economic KPIs consistently capture an abundance of media attention in France (see Figure 4). With the global decline in the public's perception of companies' delivery on CR down by 2.1-points and a 3.7-point decline in France \u2013 delivering on CR is now more important than ever.\nSet a foundation of trust. Similar to global trend, companies in France that lead in CR have earned greater levels of trust from stakeholders. CR helps companies establish foundations for, mitigate, and repair trust. But the connection between trust and CR is yet to be established in the eyes of the General Public. This remains a true opportunity for companies to impact their overall reputation while being impactful, responsible, and trustworthy.\nStrong CR means strong reputation. We define reputation as an emotional connection between organizations and their key stakeholders. Leaders in CR maintain a stronger emotional connection (+4.1-points for companies in the Top 10 in CR) compared to performance in the 7 dimensions of reputation i.e. what companies do rather than the emotion that they evoke. Through this connection, companies form an emotional buffer that can be invaluable in times of crisis.\nClear and consistent communication is a necessity. Even among the top 10 companies in CR, the levels of brand expressiveness are low. With only 22% of the general public agreeing that companies communicate in a relevant matter, there is ample opportunity for companies to communicate their corporate purpose. This will aid companies in aligning corporate reputation perception with reality.\nLeaders make a difference. With leaders such as Engie's Isabelle Kocher voicing her views on female leadership, and industrialist Jean-Dominique Senard taking initiative to reconcile business and society goals through social and environmental issue integration in business; corporate leaders can have a tremendous impact on CR. In fact, companies that lead in CR attain a strong leadership score that is 10.5-points higher than those who do not make it in the top 50 CR ranking in France (Figure"}

{"text":"o\u00eet Tournadre, Jean-Charles Dupont, Amandine Rosso, Frank Hase, Johannes Orphal, and Matthias Beekmann\nOur work investigates the diurnal evolution of atmospheric ammonia concentrations during a major pollution event. It analyses it in regard of both chemical (gas\u2013particle conversion) and physical (vertical mixing, meteorology) processes in the atmosphere. These mechanisms are key for understanding the evolution of the physicochemical state of the atmosphere; therefore, it clearly fits into the scope of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.\nThe reduction in C2H6 from 2015 to 2020 over Hefei, eastern China, points to air quality improvement in China\nYouwen Sun, Hao Yin, Cheng Liu, Emmanuel Mahieu, Justus Notholt, Yao T\u00e9, Xiao Lu, Mathias Palm, Wei Wang, Changgong Shan, Qihou Hu, Min Qin, Yuan Tian, and Bo Zheng\nThe variability, sources, and transport of ethane (C2H6) over eastern China from 2015 to 2020 were studied using ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and GEOS-Chem simulations. C2H6 variability is driven by both meteorological and emission factors. The reduction in C2H6 in recent years over eastern China points to air quality improvement in China.\nMapping the drivers of formaldehyde (HCHO) variability from 2015 to 2019 over eastern China: insights from Fourier transform infrared observation and GEOS-Chem model simulation\nYouwen Sun, Hao Yin, Cheng Liu, Lin Zhang, Yuan Cheng, Mathias Palm, Justus Notholt, Xiao Lu, Corinne Vigouroux, Bo Zheng, Wei Wang, Nicholas Jones, Changong Shan, Min Qin, Yuan Tian, Qihou Hu, Fanhao Meng, and Jianguo Liu\nThis study mapped the drivers of HCHO variability from 2015 to 2019 over eastern China. Hydroxyl (OH) radical production rates from HCHO photolysis were evaluated. The relative contributions of emitted and photochemical sources to the observed HCHO abundance were analyzed. Contributions of various emission sources and geographical regions to the observed HCHO summertime enhancements were determined.\nThe impact of Los Angeles Basin pollution and stratospheric intrusions on the surrounding San Gabriel Mountains as seen by surface measurements, lidar, and numerical models\nFernando Chouza, Thierry Leblanc, Mark Brewer, Patrick Wang, Sabino Piazzolla, Gabriele Pfister, Rajesh Kumar, Carl Drews, Simone Tilmes, Louisa Emmons, and Matthew Johnson\nThe tropospheric ozone lidar at the JPL Table Mountain Facility (TMF) was used to investigate the impact of Los Angeles (LA) Basin pollution transport and stratospheric intrusions in the planetary boundary layer on the San Gabriel Mountains. The results of this study indicate a dominant role of the LA Basin pollution on days when high ozone levels were observed at TMF (March\u2013October period).\nSudden changes in nitrogen dioxide emissions over Greece due to lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19\nMaria-Elissavet Koukouli, Ioanna Skoulidou, Andreas Karavias, Isaak Parcharidis, Dimitris Balis, Astrid Manders, Arjo Segers, Henk Eskes, and Jos van Geffen\nIn recent years, satellite observations have contributed to monitoring air quality. During the first COVID-19 lockdown, lower levels of nitrogen dioxide were observed over Greece by S5P\/TROPOMI for March and April 2020 (than the preceding year) due to decreased transport emissions. Taking meteorology into account, using LOTOS-EUROS CTM simulations, the resulting decline due to the lockdown was estimated to range between 0\u2009% and \u221237\u2009% for the five largest Greek cities, with an average of ~\u2009\u221210\u2009%.\nMonitoring CO emissions of the metropolis Mexico City using TROPOMI CO observations\nTobias Borsdorff, Agust\u00edn Garc\u00eda Reynoso, Gilberto Maldonado, Bertha Mar-Morales, Wolfgang Stremme, Michel Grutter, and Jochen Landgraf\nPollution trace gas distributions and their transport in the Asian monsoon upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere during the StratoClim campaign 2017\nS\u00f6ren Johansson, Michael H\u00f6pfner, Oliver Kirner, Ingo Wohltmann, Silvia Bucci, Bernard Legras, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Norbert Glatthor, Erik Kretschmer, J\u00f6rn Ungermann, and Gerald Wetzel\nWe present high-resolution measurements of pollutant trace gases (PAN, C2H2, and HCOOH) in the Asian monsoon UTLS from the airborne limb imager GLORIA"}

Convection is investigated using backward trajectories of the models ATLAS and TRACZILLA with advanced detection of convection.\nSpatial distribution of enhanced BrO and its relation to meteorological parameters in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice regions\nSora Seo, Andreas Richter, Anne-Marlene Blechschmidt, Ilias Bougoudis, and John Philip Burrows\nIn this study, we present spatial distributions of occurrence frequency of enhanced total BrO column and various meteorological parameters affecting it in the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice regions by using 10 years of GOME-2 measurements and meteorological model data. Statistical analysis using the long-term dataset shows clear differences in the meteorological conditions between the mean field and the situation of enhanced total BrO columns in both polar sea ice regions.\nTrends of atmospheric water vapour in Switzerland from ground-based radiometry, FTIR and GNSS data\nLeonie Bernet, Elmar Brockmann, Thomas von Clarmann, Niklaus K\u00e4mpfer, Emmanuel Mahieu, Christian M\u00e4tzler, Gunter Stober, and Klemens Hocke\nWith global warming, water vapour increases in the atmosphere. Water vapour is an important gas because it is a natural greenhouse gas and affects the formation of clouds, rain and snow. How much water vapour increases can vary in different regions of the world. To verify if it increases as expected on a regional scale, we analysed water vapour measurements in Switzerland. We found that water vapour generally increases as expected from temperature changes, except in winter.\nA Raman lidar tropospheric water vapour climatology and height-resolved trend analysis over Payerne, Switzerland\nShannon Hicks-Jalali, Robert J. Sica, Giovanni Martucci, Eliane Maillard Barras, Jordan Voirin, and Alexander Haefele\nWe have calculated an 11.5-year water vapour climatology using the Raman Lidar for Meteorological Observations (RALMO), located in Payerne, Switzerland. The climatology shows that the highest water vapour concentrations are in the summer months and the lowest in the winter months. We present for the first time height-resolved water vapour trends, which show that water vapour increases specific humidity by between 5\u2009% and 15\u2009% per decade depending on the altitude.\nThe potential of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 data to reduce the uncertainties in CO2 surface fluxes over Australia using a variational assimilation scheme\nYohanna Villalobos, Peter Rayner, Steven Thomas, and Jeremy Silver\nEstimated carbon fluxes for Australia are subject to considerable uncertainty. We ran simulation experiments over Australia to determine how much these uncertainties can be constrained using satellite data. We found that the satellite data has the potential to reduce these uncertainties up to 80\u2009% across the whole continent. For 1 month, this percentage corresponds to 0.51\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009y-1 for Australia. This method could lead to significantly more accurate estimates of Australia's carbon budget.\nObserving carbon dioxide emissions over China's cities and industrial areas with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2\nBo Zheng, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chevallier, Philippe Ciais, Gr\u00e9goire Broquet, Yilong Wang, Jinghui Lian, and Yuanhong Zhao\nThe Paris Climate Agreement requires all parties to report CO2 emissions regularly. Given the self-reporting nature of this system, it is critical to evaluate the emission reports with independent observation systems. Here we present the direct observations of city CO2 plumes from space and the quantification of CO2 emissions from these observations over the largest emitter country China. The emissions from 46 hot-spot regions representing 13\u2009% of China's total emissions can be well constrained.\nObservational evidence of moistening the lowermost stratosphere via isentropic mixing across the subtropical jet\nJeffery Langille, Adam Bourassa, Laura L. Pan, Daniel Letros, Brian Solheim, Daniel Zawada, and Doug Degenstein\nWater vapour (WV) is a highly variable and extremely important trace gas in Earth's atmosphere. Due to its radiative and chemical properties, it is coupled to the climate in an extremely complex manner. This is especially true in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS). Despite its importance, the physical processes that control mixing and the distribution of WV in the LMS are poorly understood. This study provides observational evidence of moistening the LMS via mixing across the subtropical jet.\nFourier transform infrared time series of tropospheric"}

The seasonality and interannual variability of tropospheric HCN columns were investigated. The potential sources that drive the observed HCN seasonality and interannual variability were determined using a GEOS-Chem tagged CO simulation, global fire maps, and potential source contribution function values calculated using HYSPLIT back trajectories.\nNH3 emissions from large point sources derived from CrIS and IASI satellite observations\nEnrico Dammers, Chris A. McLinden, Debora Griffin, Mark W. Shephard, Shelley Van Der Graaf, Erik Lutsch, Martijn Schaap, Yonatan Gainairu-Matz, Vitali Fioletov, Martin Van Damme, Simon Whitburn, Lieven Clarisse, Karen Cady-Pereira, Cathy Clerbaux, Pierre Francois Coheur, and Jan Willem Erisman\nAmmonia is an essential molecule in the environment, but at its current levels it is unsustainable. However, the emissions are highly uncertain. We explore the use of satellites to estimate the ammonia lifetime and emissions around point sources to help improve the budget. The same method applied to different satellite instruments shows consistent results. Comparison to the emission inventories shows that those are underestimating emissions of point sources by on average a factor of 2.5.\nDiurnal cycle of short-term fluctuations of integrated water vapour above Switzerland\nKlemens Hocke, Leonie Bernet, Jonas Hagen, Axel Murk, Matthias Renker, and Christian M\u00e4tzler\nThe Tropospheric Water Radiometer (TROWARA) observed an enhanced intensity of short-term integrated water vapour (IWV) fluctuations during daytime in summer. These IWV fluctuations are possibly related to latent heat flux and thermal convective activity in the lower troposphere. The observed climatology and spectra of IWV fluctuations might be useful for modelling studies of water vapour convection in the atmospheric boundary layer at mid latitudes.\nRetrieval of total column and surface NO2 from Pandora zenith-sky measurements\nXiaoyi Zhao, Debora Griffin, Vitali Fioletov, Chris McLinden, Jonathan Davies, Akira Ogyu, Sum Chi Lee, Alexandru Lupu, Michael D. Moran, Alexander Cede, Martin Tiefengraber, and Moritz M\u00fcller\nNew nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieval algorithms are developed for Pandora zenith-sky measurements. A column-to-surface conversion look-up table was produced for the Pandora instruments; therefore, quick and practical Pandora-based surface NO2 concentration data can be obtained for air quality monitoring purposes. It is demonstrated that the surface NO2 concentration is controlled not only by the planetary boundary layer height but also by both boundary layer dynamics and photochemistry.\nMAX-DOAS measurements of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO in Nanjing and a comparison to ozone monitoring instrument observations\nKa Lok Chan, Zhuoru Wang, Aijun Ding, Klaus-Peter Heue, Yicheng Shen, Jing Wang, Feng Zhang, Yining Shi, Nan Hao, and Mark Wenig\nThe paper presents long-term observations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) in Nanjing using a MAX-DOAS instrument. The measurements were performed from April 2013 to February 2017. The MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO are used to validate OMI satellite observations and to investigate the influences of region transport of air pollutants on the air quality in Nanjing.\nConsistency and representativeness of integrated water vapour from ground-based GPS observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis\nOlivier Bock and Ana C. Parracho\nWe examine the consistency of global IWV data from ERA-Interim reanalysis and 16 years of GPS observations. Representativeness differences are found to be a dominant error source, with a strong dependence on geographic, topographic, and climatic features, which explain both average and extreme differences. A methodology for reducing the representativeness errors and detecting the extreme, outlying, cases is discussed.\nTowards monitoring localized CO2 emissions from space: co-located regional CO2 and NO2"}

We analyze enhancements of CO2 and NO2 observed by OCO-2 and S5P and estimate the CO2 plume cross-sectional fluxes that we compare with emission databases. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of simultaneous satellite observations of CO2 and NO2 as envisaged for the European Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission\nVariability of bulk water vapor content in the marine cloudy boundary layers from microwave and near-infrared imagery\nLuis F. Mill\u00e1n, Matthew D. Lebsock, and Joao Teixeira\nThe synergy of the collocated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides daily global estimates of marine boundary layer water vapor. AMSR provides the total column water vapor, while MODIS provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor.\nTrends and trend reversal detection in 2 decades of tropospheric NO2 satellite observations\nAristeidis K. Georgoulias, Ronald J. van der A, Piet Stammes, K. Folkert Boersma, and Henk J. Eskes\nIn this paper, a \u223c21-year self-consistent global dataset from four different satellite sensors is compiled for the first time to study the long-term tropospheric NO2 patterns and trends. A novel method capable of detecting the year when a reversal of trends happened shows that tropospheric NO2 concentrations switched from positive to negative trends and vice versa over several regions around the globe during the last 2 decades.\nSatellite-derived sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the 2014\u20132015 Holuhraun eruption (Iceland)\nElisa Carboni, Tamsin A. Mather, Anja Schmidt, Roy G. Grainger, Melissa A. Pfeffer, Iolanda Ialongo, and Nicolas Theys\nThe 2014\u20132015 Holuhraun eruption was the largest in Iceland for 200 years, emitting huge quantities of gas into the troposphere, at times overwhelming European anthropogenic emissions. Infrared Atmospheric sounding Interferometer data are used to derive the first time series of daily sulfur dioxide mass and vertical distribution over the eruption period. A scheme is used to estimate sulfur dioxide fluxes, the total erupted mass, and how long the sulfur dioxide remains in the atmosphere.\nEmissions of methane in Europe inferred by total column measurements\nDebra Wunch, Dylan B. A. Jones, Geoffrey C. Toon, Nicholas M. Deutscher, Frank Hase, Justus Notholt, Ralf Sussmann, Thorsten Warneke, Jeroen Kuenen, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Jenny A. Fisher, and Joannes D. Maasakkers\nWe used five atmospheric observatories in Europe measuring total column dry-air mole fractions of methane and carbon monoxide to infer methane emissions in the area between the observatories. We find that the methane emissions are overestimated by the state-of-the-art inventories, and that this is likely due, at least in part, to the inventory disaggregation. We find that there is significant uncertainty in the carbon monoxide inventories that requires further investigation.\nOn the interpretation of upper-tropospheric humidity based on a second-order retrieval from infrared radiances\nKlaus Gierens and Kostas Eleftheratos\nWe derive a new method to retrieve upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH) from High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) channel 12 brightness temperatures. With the new method we solve an old problem, namely that the wavelength change that occurred between HIRS 2 on NOAA 14 and HIRS 3 on NOAA 15 led to the retrieval of many more events with high UTH; that is, the time series shows strong jumps at high UTH values. This old problem is solved with the new retrieval.\nCarbon monoxide air pollution on sub-city scales and along arterial roads detected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument\nTobias Borsdorff, Joost aan de Brugh, Sudhanshu Pandey, Otto Hasekamp, Ilse Aben, Sander Houweling, and Jochen Landgraf\nThe Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite provides"}

In this study, we analyzed local CO enhancements in an area around Iran from 1 November to 20 December 2017 using the WRF model and evaluated CO emissions from the cities of Tehran, Yerevan, Urmia, and Tabriz.\nGround-based MAX-DOAS observations of tropospheric formaldehyde VCDs and comparisons with the CAMS model at a rural site near Beijing during APEC 2014\nXin Tian, Pinhua Xie, Jin Xu, Yang Wang, Ang Li, Fengcheng Wu, Zhaokun Hu, Cheng Liu, and Qiong Zhang\nWe used the MAX-DOAS instrument installed at the UCAS, Beijing, to evaluate effects on HCHO. The daily variation, transport, sources, and the effect of APEC emission control measures on HCHO were analyzed. Dependences of HCHO VCDs on wind fields indicated that the HCHO values were affected by the transport of pollutants from the south. The results from comparing the MAX-DOAS with the CAMS model indicate the CAMS model can simulate the effects of transport and the secondary sources of HCHO well.\nTrends in global tropospheric ozone inferred from a composite record of TOMS\/OMI\/MLS\/OMPS satellite measurements and the MERRA-2 GMI simulation\nJerry R.

Taylor\nBoth a 38-year merged satellite record of tropospheric ozone from TOMS\/OMI\/MLS\/OMPS and a MERRA-2 GMI model simulation show large increases of 6\u20137 Dobson units from the Near East to India\u2013East Asia and eastward over the Pacific. These increases in tropospheric ozone are attributed to increases in pollution over the region over the last several decades. Secondary 38-year increases of 4\u20135 Dobson units with both GMI model and satellite measurements occur over central African\u2013tropical Atlantic.\nSpatial and temporal changes in SO2 regimes over China in the recent decade and the driving mechanism\nTing Wang, Pucai Wang, Nicolas Theys, Dan Tong, Fran\u00e7ois Hendrick, Qiang Zhang, and Michel Van Roozendael\nIn the last decade, four temporal regimes of SO2 in China have been identified. After an initial rise, SO2 undergoes two sharp drops in 2007\u20132008 and 2014\u20132016, during which 5-year rebounding is sustained. Different mechanisms are tied to North and South China. The industrial emission is responsible for SO2 variation in North China, while in South China the meteorological conditions make a large contribution. The result is crucial to the understanding of SO2 changes and future polices.\nGlobal IWV trends and variability in atmospheric reanalyses and GPS observations\nAna C. Parracho, Olivier Bock, and Sophie Bastin\nIntegrated water vapour from GPS observations and two modern atmospheric reanalyses were compared for 1995\u20132010. Means, variability and trend signs were in general good agreement. Regions and GPS stations with poor agreement were investigated further. Representativeness issues, uncertainties in reanalyses, and inhomogeneities in GPS were evidenced. Reanalyses were compared for an extended period, and a focus on north Africa and Australia highlighted the impact of dynamics on water vapour trends.\nOzone seasonal evolution and photochemical production regime in the polluted troposphere in eastern China derived from high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometry (FTS) observations\nYouwen Sun, Cheng Liu, Mathias Palm, Corinne Vigouroux, Justus Notholt, Qihou Hu, Nicholas Jones, Wei Wang, Wenjing Su, Wenqiang Zhang, Changong Shan, Yuan Tian, Xingwei Xu, Martine De Mazi\u00e8re, Minqiang Zhou, and Jianguo Liu\nThe seasonal evolution of O3 and its photochemical production regime in a polluted region of eastern China between 2014 and 2017 was investigated using FTS observations.

Ground-based in situ and FTIR (NDACC and TCCON) measurements are used to show their complementarity with regards to obtaining the CO and CH4 concentrations at the surface and in the troposphere and stratosphere. FLEXPART and GEOS-Chem models are applied to understand the seasonal variations of CO and CH4 at this site.\nHarmonisation and trends of 20-year tropical tropospheric ozone data\nElpida Leventidou, Mark Weber, Kai-Uwe Eichmann, John P. Burrows, Klaus-Peter Heue, Anne M. Thompson, and Bryan J. Johnson\nThree individual tropical tropospheric ozone (TTCO) datasets (1996\u20132015) retrieved with the convective-cloud differential method (Leventidou et al., 2016) have been harmonised in order to study the global and regional TTCO trends. The trends range between \u22124 to 4\u2009DU per decade testing six different merging scenarios. No trend has been found for the global tropics using the preferred scenario. It is concluded that harmonisation is one of the major sources of uncertainty in the trend estimates.\nCharacterizing biospheric carbon balance using CO2 observations from the OCO-2 satellite\nScot M. Miller, Anna M. Michalak, Vineet Yadav, and Jovan M. Tadi\u0107\nNASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite observes CO2 in the atmosphere globally. We evaluate the extent to which current OCO-2 observations can inform scientific understanding of the biospheric carbon balance. We find that current observations are best-equipped to constrain the biospheric carbon balance across continental or hemispheric regions and provide limited information on smaller regions.\nDetection of O4 absorption around 328 and 419\u202fnm in measured atmospheric absorption spectra\nJohannes Lampel, Johannes Zielcke, Stefan Schmitt, Denis P\u00f6hler, Udo Frie\u00df, Ulrich Platt, and Thomas Wagner\nPrevious publications on the absorptions of the oxygen dimer O2\u2013O2 (or short: O4) list absorption peaks at 328\u2009nm and 419\u2009nm, for which no spectrally resolved literature cross sections are available. As these absorptions potentially influence the spectral retrieval of various other trace gases, their shape and magnitude need to be quantified. We approximate the absorption peaks at 328\u2009nm and 419\u2009nm by their respective neighboring absorption peaks to estimate their magnitude and peak wavelength.\nInvestigations of temporal and spatial distribution of precursors SO2 and NO2 vertical columns in the North China Plain using mobile DOAS\nFengcheng Wu, Pinhua Xie, Ang Li, Fusheng Mou, Hao Chen, Yi Zhu, Tong Zhu, Jianguo Liu, and Wenqing Liu\nInvestigating the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants, emissions, and pollution transport is necessary to better understand the effect of various sources on air quality. We report on mobile differential optical absorption spectroscopy (mobile DOAS) observations of precursors SO2 and NO2 vertical columns in NCP in the summer of 2013 (from 11 June to 7 July) in this study.\nQuantification of CO emissions from the city of Madrid using MOPITT satellite retrievals and WRF simulations\nIris N.

There are two methods used and reviewed in this paper: a method that can only estimate a trend in the emission and a newly developed method that also includes model data from WRF to quantify the emissions. We find Madrid CO emissions to be lower by 48\u2009% for 2002 and by 17\u2009% for 2006 compared with the EdgarV4.2 emission inventory, but uncertainty (20 to 50\u2009%) remains.\nContributions of the troposphere and stratosphere to CH4 model biases\nZhiting Wang, Thorsten Warneke,"}

It is observed in other studies that simulated total columns of atmospheric methane present a latitudinal bias compared to measurements. The latitudinal gradients are considered to be from the stratosphere. However, our results show that the latitudinal biases could come from the troposphere in two of three models evaluated in this study.\nTypical meteorological conditions associated with extreme nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution events over Scandinavia\nManu Anna Thomas and Abhay Devasthale\nEpisodes of extreme pollution events of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can seriously hamper air quality. But under which meteorological conditions do such extreme pollution events occur over Scandinavia? Using observational and reanalysis data it is shown that south-westerly winds (sustained for at least a few days) dominate during extreme events and cause an increase in humidity and clouds. South-easterly winds have the second largest contribution and the pollution transport is rapid when they prevail.\nTemporal characteristics of atmospheric ammonia and nitrogen dioxide over China based on emission data, satellite observations and atmospheric transport modeling since 1980\nLei Liu, Xiuying Zhang, Wen Xu, Xuejun Liu, Yi Li, Xuehe Lu, Yuehan Zhang, and Wuting Zhang\nWe conducted temporal trend analysis of atmospheric NH3 and NO2 in China since 1980 based on emission data (during 1980\u20132010), satellite observations (for NH3 since 2008 and for NO2 since 2005) and atmospheric chemistry transport modeling (during 2008\u20132015). Our findings provide an overall insight into the temporal trends in both NO2 and NH3 since 1980, and the multivariate data used in this study have implications for estimating long-term Nr deposition datasets.\nMore articles (45)\nAires, F., Rossow, W.

{"text":"Maryland Study Demonstrates Mid-Atlantic Offshore Wind Capacity\nOffshore wind farms could generate more than enough energy to meet Maryland's annual electricity consumption, according to a just-published study by researchers at the University of Delaware. The potential power output is nearly double current energy demands for the state, even when taking into account various limitations on where to place equipment in the Atlantic.\n\"Installing wind turbines far off the coast of Maryland would help the state generate large quantities of electricity while creating local jobs,\" said study co-author Willett Kempton, professor of marine policy in UD's College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment (CEOE). \"Producing more electricity this way also displaces fossil fuel generation, thus reducing harmful carbon dioxide emissions and improving air quality.\"\nExisting Maryland law requires 18 percent of electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2022. The law was passed before the potential supply of offshore wind was documented\u2014no one even knew whether offshore wind was of significant size.\nOffshore wind could be important to meeting Maryland's requirement because it is more abundant and more steady than land-based Maryland wind, and is less expensive than solar power.\n\"If the offshore resource remains unused, meeting the state's renewable energy requirement will be more costly to Maryland, as is true for the other mid-Atlantic coastal states,\" Kempton noted.\nThe study found that a maximum of 7,800 wind turbines could provide an annual average output of 14,000 megawatts, equivalent to 189 percent of Maryland's electric load. The calculation includes the use of new technology for deep-water turbines, but even using only commercially proven, shallow-water equipment, the energy generated would total 70 percent of the state's annual demand. This is the maximum resource possible, but actual development of offshore wind would start with power plant-sized units of 80 to 150 turbines.\nIn determining areas of the ocean suitable for offshore wind farm development, the researchers excluded zones of possible conflict. The entire Chesapeake Bay was excluded. Fish havens and areas where birds migrate were not counted, as well as shipping routes.\nThe study also considered how visible the turbines would be from shore, placing the turbines eight nautical miles away so that visual impact would be minimal.\nAlong with the rest of the mid-Atlantic region, large shallow areas and strong winds off Maryland's coast make it suitable for currently available offshore windmill technology.\nThe study found that average power output would be highest in the winter and lowest in the summer. Extra power generated during the winter months could service neighboring states, while Maryland would need to rely on other sources during a comparative shortage in the summer. Developers could position windmills to capitalize on seasonal wind direction, such as to the southwest for summer winds.\nThe findings were recently published in the Elsevier journal Renewable Energy."}

{"text":"SC Johnson's acre-for-acre match campaign garnered donations from all 50 U.S. states and 31 countries.\nA multimillion-dollar, six-year project will restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazonia region by 2023.\nRACINE, Wis., October 16, 2017 \u2013 SC Johnson today announced that the funds raised from its 2017 acre-for-acre match challenge will be used to kick off the world's largest tropical reforestation project in the Brazilian Amazon. Through a partnership with Conservation International (CI) earlier this year to support the virtual reality film Under the Canopy, SC Johnson enlisted the public to help protect 10,000 acres of the Amazon rainforest through its acre-for-acre match campaign.\n\"A new chapter is being written for the Brazilian Amazon. The Amazon is our greatest asset and vital to the well-being of people not just in Brazil but across the entire planet. Protecting the Amazon is not something we should think about in future terms \u2013 we have to do it now,\" said Rodrigo Medeiros, Vice President of CI Brazil. \"The task is challenging but we are working in partnership with SC Johnson and other organizations, connecting different objectives toward the same goal: the Amazon.\"\nSC Johnson's acre-for-acre match campaign garnered donations from all 50 U.S. states and 31 countries through CI's website. The funds raised will support CI and its partners as they embark on the world's largest tropical forest restoration project. The multimillion-dollar, six-year project, which is the result of a partnership between Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank and Rock in Rio, will restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazonia region by 2023. The endeavor will also help Brazil move toward its Paris Agreement target of reforesting 12 million hectares of land by 2030.\nSC Johnson has been operating in Brazil for more than 80 years. In that time, the company's manufacturing plant in Manaus has achieved zero landfill status, a protocol estimated to keep some 91 tons of refuse out of Brazilian landfills each year. In the 1990s, SC Johnson contributed to the protection of two reserves in Brazil's Caatinga ecoregion. Since then, as part of the company's work with and contributions to CI, more than 100,000 acres of land have been conserved \u2013 much of that in the Amazon region.\nThe Johnson family has a long personal connection to Brazil. In 1935, third-generation company leader H.F. Johnson, Jr. led an expedition up the Amazon in search of the Carna\u00faba palm, whose wax was the principle ingredient in the company's products at the time. In 1998, fourth-generation leader Sam Johnson and his sons, including fifth-generation leader Fisk Johnson, retraced the historic expedition made by H.F. Johnson, Jr.\nUnder the Canopy is an immersive 360-degree virtual reality film that allows viewers to experience the wonder of the Amazon through the eyes of the indigenous people who inhabit the region and are essential to its protection. The film, which has received more than 700,000 views worldwide, highlights why people need Amazonia to thrive, from its role as the world's largest watershed to the fact that its trees absorb carbon and help regulate climate. The film has been screened to international audiences at events including Sundance Film Festival, South by Southwest, GreenBiz and the Tropical Forest Alliance General Assembly 2020 meeting in Brazil."}

Visit 3rdEye Photo for more images.\nI'm really very excited to let you know that our friends from Renfrew County CFDC have officially launched their own version of the N100 startup competition (click here to read the media release)! Dubbed: the RC100, Renfrew has thrown down the gauntlet to technology startups that can have a presence and impact in Renfrew County. As in N100, startups will compete for a $100K convertible note that will vault them onto a venture capital track and get them moving with critical early stage support. Click here to check out the all new RC100.\n\"Some people define work-life balance as desperately trying to carve leisure time out of their day-to-day grind. In contrast, many Renfrew County residents spend their weekdays at highly engaging careers where they apply their skills by finding creative solutions to real-world problems. And, once the workday is over, the area's outdoor lifestyle awaits with activities that include paddling the Ottawa River, cycling on scenic country roads or through forest paths as well as tackling ski hills and trails in the winter months.\" So true. Being metro-adjacent along the Ottawa River, close to Canada's National Capital Region, Renfrew County is 7,645 square kilometres with 900 lakes and 4 major river systems. It is a striking part of Ontario with amazing people and creative industries\u2014some historic and others emerging, like craft bear and eco-tourism. You will find expertise in Aerospace, Wood Products, Renewable Energy, Defense and Security, Metals and Machining, Advanced Manufacturing and Agri-business, as mentioned on RC100's new website. Last year I met many of the innovative industry and manufacturing leaders through the local EMC chapter. I've also visited and learned from the Renfrew Industrial Commission.\nMore on RC100: I am also proud to report that our N100 software sponsors MathWorks and Budgeto are also supporting the RC100, alongside Invest Ottawa, BDC, SRB Technologies Canada, Algonquin College, Edwards PC Creative Law, and many more who recognize the important of driving innovation and next generation entrepreneurship. Under the leadership of Executive Director Diane McKinnon and her team at Renfrew County CFDC, including Mike Thompson, I have no doubt that RC100 will strengthen the chain of innovation running across Eastern Ontario (and not just in urban centres, but in metro-adjacent, rural and small town communities as well).\nOn behalf of everyone at Northumberland CFDC, I'd like to wish Renfrew CFDC every best success with the inaugural year of RC100! Looks like I'll have a frontline view of the action as I was asked to participate as part of the RC100 judging panel for 2018, along with Ryan McCartney (BDC Communitech), R&D technologist, inventor, entrepreneur and angel investor, Kirk Dobbs, and Stephane Levesque (SRB Technologies Canada) who is also a member of Northumberland CFDC's Collaborative Innovation Panel\u2014a group which played a summative role in recently deploying $6 million in co-investment in innovation capital across rural Eastern Ontario, with the support of FedDev Ontario and the Government of Canada.\nFinally, RC100 will run on the previous\/usual N100 timeline (March deadline, three competitive rounds, and the winner announced in the summer). Meanwhile, our N100 call for applications this year will go out in May with the deadline in July and the winner announced in November.\nYou can apply now for RC100.\nThe rural renaissance is alive in Eastern Ontario!"}

Water Policy 1 December 2020; 22 (6): 1015\u20131023. doi: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2166\/wp.2020.062\nThe paper describes the Global Water Partnership partner experience in the introduction of risk-based Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) into the Ukrainian water policy. We concluded that some proper 'expressions' and concepts have already been introduced into Ukrainian legislation, but not the accepted'meanings' of such concepts as IWRM, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and water security. The concept of'sustainable management', in the Russian version of Water SDG6, is translated as 'rational use' but no one can explain why. We suggest that such a misunderstanding happened since Ukrainian decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obligated to achieve any development goals. Therefore, they are quite comfortable with the existing normative approach to water management where the objectives are compliance with defined norms and ensuring water security, which is understood as an absence of any water risk solely to humans, rather than the environment at large. Keeping in mind that true science starts with measurable values, and recognizing that you cannot manage if you cannot measure, we propose to change this false understanding of water security and sustainability that is inherent in the outmoded concept of 'rational use'. Such a shift is only possible by switching to a measurable goal-oriented approach and risk management in water policy.\nThe article describes the Global Water Partnership partner experience in the introduction of risk-based IWRM into the Ukrainian water policy where the concept of'sustainable management', in the Russian version of Water SDG6, is translated as 'rational use'.\nWe suggest that this happened since Ukrainian decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obligated to achieve any development goals.\nIWRM, Rational use, Risk, SDGs, Sustainable management, Water security\nUkraine and most former nations of the USSR were quite comfortable with existing normative approaches to water management (Woodhouse & Muller, 2017), where the objective was mere compliance with predetermined norms or standards and where water security was understood as an absence of any water risk, primarily health and safety risks to the human population.\nUkraine first faced the challenge of introducing the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach into its national policy discussions during the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development (2002). For example, it was not clear why translators used one English word \u2013 'complex', to translate another English word \u2013 'integrated', in para. 25 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (UN, 2002). Another problem with translation was the word'management' which, in the case of water, was always translated as 'use', shifting the focus towards human use of water only, excluding instream uses, ecosystems, and even recreational uses. Also misinterpreted was the keyword'sustainable', which was translated as 'rational use' [\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043ee \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438e] into the official UN Russian translation.\nThis misunderstanding was further deepened within the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) development process where, until now, the words'sustainable management' in the Water SDG6 are translated into Russian as 'rational use' (UN, 2015). Anyone in Ukraine could see the difference between the official UN-translated Russian and English texts of SDGs but could not explain the reasons for such differences. We suggest that such a misunderstanding occurred because Ukrainian water managers and policy decision-makers still perceive themselves only as water users who are not obliged to achieve any sustainable development goals.\nTo"}
{"text":" overcome limitations of the traditional water management approach, and having long experience in building Decision Support Systems (DSS) for off-site emergency management in case of a nuclear accident in Europe (European Commission, 2000), we, at UCEWP as a partner of Global Water Partnership (GWP), proposed rethinking water security and introducing integrated risk management approaches into water resources management in Ukraine (GWP Ukraine, 2016). The main idea was to support the ability of Ukrainian water decision-makers to run scenario simulations for attaining optimal sets of measures to reach water-related SDGs for Ukraine.\nScenario analysis requires a predictive probabilistic model because it is difficult and expensive to build a satisfactory picture based only on measurements for deterministic models. Probabilistic statistical analysis, however, introduces considerable scientific uncertainty that is poorly tolerated by policymakers. We, as representatives of academic institution building DSS for policymakers, were quite aware of this so-called science-policy gap defined as the difference in levels of confidence for a given scientific finding expressed by the scientific community and society because, for scientists, the probability and uncertainty are an accepted aspect of analysis, whereas, for government policy and decision-making, certainty is desired (Bradshaw & Borchers, 2000). In the case of global climate change, analysis narrowing the science-policy gap in water management is particularly important as people will experience the impacts of climate change mostly through the impacts on water availability and environmental quality \u2013 mainly via floods, droughts, and degraded water quality.\nBelow is a description of GWP's experience in Ukraine of the 'Rethinking Water Security' campaign, where we tried to realign the definition of water security and sustainable development, linked with that of scientific uncertainty by decision-makers, with that of the science community in Ukraine (GWP Ukraine, 2016, 2017, 2019).\nThe easiest way to understand the difference between 'integrated' and 'complex' management is to compare their definitions. Classic GWP's definition of IWRM describes it as 'a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems' (GWP, 2000). The official Russian translation of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (UN, 2002), transformed the word 'integrated' into 'complex', thus creating an impression for Russian-speaking water managers in Ukraine that IWRM is the equivalent of a well-accepted Soviet-era understanding of 'complex use and protection of water resources' as a'set of measures to reduce water consumption and increase the efficiency in different economic sectors'. One can see that the main difference between the two definitions is that 'complex' has no reference to sustainability or integration, via sound water management, of the principal objectives of sustainable water management \u2013 social, economic, and environmental.\nSince 2002, GWP, at the global level, spent considerable efforts to promote its definition of IWRM, insisting that water resources should not be used just 'rationally', i.e., economically efficient. This definition was mainly useful if the water is considered primarily as a factor in economic production, shifting the focus towards human use of water only, excluding instream uses, ecosystems, and even recreational uses. GWP is proud that the word'management' was finally included in the terminology of UN SDGs (J\u00f8nch-Clausen, 2004; Shah, 2016). But this success relates to the English text of SDGs only, while the words'sustainable management' in the Water SDG6 are still translated into Russian as 'rational use'. Ukraine faces a similar problem. Despite all efforts of GWP in Ukraine, all amendments to the Water Code of Ukraine (Ukrainian Parliament, 2020) mention that integrated management is the equivalent of complex management but only at the basin level.\nFailing in this legal and administrative battle of definitions, GWP decided to focus their attention and efforts to a better-grounded scientific emphasis, keeping in mind that true science starts with measurable values and that resources cannot be effectively managed if they cannot be adequately measured. What performance indicators could be measured that are representative of a broad concept, such as IWRM? Explaining after the Johannesburg Summit, the difference between IWRM and traditional water planning of the 20th century, GWP (J\u00f8nch-Clausen, 2004) proposed that the main difference is that IWRM has a principal goal. The best example of such a goal is proposed by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), where the main aim is to reach a 'good state for all waters', which means instream water quality improvements that translate into ecological improvements and better water quality for all human uses and for ecosystems. Achieving such a goal could be readily measured and therefore water could be managed much more effectively and efficiently (OECD, 2011, 2015; Woodhouse & Muller, 2017).\nOn the other hand, Woodhouse & Muller (2017)"}
{"text":" mentioned that traditional water management is based on the normative approach when the objective is compliance with some norms or standards. Limitations of such approaches for development planning are well described in the European Commission Guide on the convergence of traditional water planning with the EU Directives (European Commission, 2003). First, compliance is hard to measure as it could provide YES or NO answers only. Second, traditional water management uses norms developed within the concept of 'zero-risk' to human health. But no development strategy can be developed if any risk is deemed unacceptable. Zero-risk is practically unattainable, and simply not cost-effective, especially in water quality considerations.\nUkraine is designated as an 'associated country' with the EU and its new Environmental Strategy (Ukrainian Parliament, 2019) speaks of'supporting sustainable development and reducing environmental risks' rather than 'normative environmental protection and ensuring environmental security'. But this understanding is not incorporated yet into the water and civil defense policy and legal documents, where water and civil security is still understood as 'an absence of any risks'. In this situation, Ukrainian water managers are quite comfortable with such a two-tiered compliance system as they are not obligated to achieve any sustainable development goals, focusing primarily on human health and safety objectives. Traditional water planning envisages only one commitment of water agencies \u2013 protection of water resources for human use, but not reaching any substantive degree of sustainable water resources management.\nThe current understanding, by Ukraine's water management sector, of sustainable development (SD) is purely social; they think that SD is 'the right of future generations to satisfy their [material] needs' rather than their 'ability to satisfy their present and future social, ecological and economic needs through integrated resources management'. Therefore, they do not understand why they have to achieve any measurable SDGs, as the 'right to clean water' is already included in the Ukrainian Constitution and 'rational use of water resources' is already included in the National Water Code (Ukrainian Parliament, 2020). Thus, it is difficult to assess implementation progress and compliance with either IWRM objectives or SDGs when the legislation itself still conveys the outmoded and largely discarded sense of what modern water management aims to achieve.\nFor the same reason, DSS based on optimization modeling is not requested by Ukrainian water managers. The adoption of UN SDGs in 2015 provided Ukrainian water management and environmental ministries a good opportunity to introduce and demonstrate the advantages of optimization modeling to ensure the effective and efficient achievement of SDGs. In 2017, GWP and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine conducted a joint baseline study of SDG6.5.1. Indicator \u2013 Degree of IWRM Implementation (0-100) (UN Environment, 2018), to assess the progress in implementation of water-related SDG6.5 IWRM Implementation, where Ukraine scored only 39\/100 points (DHI, 2017).\nSuch a low score on IWRM implementation prompted discussions in Ukraine, as many water managers were sure that IWRM, which was equivalent to the Soviet-style complex WRM in their minds, was already rather well implemented in Ukraine. To support further discussions on the meaning of sustainability in the water sector, GWP organized a national policy dialogue on Water Security and Management with a series of on-line surveys (GWP Ukraine, 2016, 2017, 2019), to clarify what the SDGs meant for Ukraine and its water management community, and what type of management \u2013 integrated or complex \u2013 should be implemented in Ukraine within SDGs' achievement process. As a result, GWP discovered that when managers (especially young) understand that they have to assess the degree of IWRM, not the degree of 'complex' WRM, they halved the score for the degree of IWRM implementation \u2013 to approximately 20 points. An equivalent outcome was obtained with the assessment of sustainability \u2013 when managers understood that sustainability does not equate to the rational use of water, they put rather low scores on the degree of water-related SDG implementation in the Ukrainian policy documents.\nWe believe that the reasons for adherence to a standards-based normative approach in traditional water management in Ukraine go back to:\na false understanding of water security as an absence of any water risk;\ninstitutional non-compliance with OECD water governance principles.\nTo change such traditional thinking, GWP together with the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine organized the Rethinking Water Security campaign (GWP Ukraine, 2016), following the guidelines proposed by OECD (OECD, 2011, 2015) and by GWP (Shah, 2016). Based on the results of the series of National Dialogues on Rethinking Security in Ukraine, a fundamental shift in approach to tackling water security was proposed. To develop policy responses to achieve water security objectives, national authorities were urged to:\nswitch from the 'control' over resource-related hazards to the management of acceptable or socially 'tolerable' levels of four water risks \u2013 the risk of shortage (including droughts), the risk"}
{"text":" of inadequate quality, the risk of excess (including floods), and the risk of undermining the ecological resilience of freshwater systems;\nincorporate, in legally binding documents, the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD, 2015), where:\n'Effectiveness relates to the contribution of governance, i.e., existing institutional responsibilities to define clear sustainable water policy goals and targets at all levels of government, to implement those policy goals, and to meet expected targets.\nEfficiency relates to the contribution of governance to maximize the benefits of sustainable water management and welfare at the least cost to society.\nTrust and engagementrelate to the contribution of governance to building public confidence and ensuring the inclusiveness of stakeholders through democratic legitimacy and fairness for society at large.'\nAs a result of these intense and lengthy discussions over the last five years, the Ukrainian Parliament finally adopted the National Strategy on Environmental Policy until 2030 (Ukrainian Parliament, 2019). The updated strategy incorporated the recommendations of the GWP-led National Dialogues and replaced the old environmental goals on 'ensuring environmental security and normative environmental protection' with the new ones \u2013 'ensuring SD and reducing environmental risks'.\nThe first important conceptual step has been accomplished. However, the stakeholders from different sectors of Ukrainian society still lack a clear understanding of risks associated with natural and man-made hazards, where, according to the Sendai Framework, 'risk' is defined as a product of 'hazard', 'exposure', and 'vulnerability' (OECD, 2013; UNISDR, 2015). These nuanced differences can be illustrated by the policy discussion in the Parliament of Ukraine. The initial version, proposed by GWP and supported by government after wide consultations with key stakeholders, suggested the following formulation of Goal #4 \u2013'reducing environmental risks to ecosystems and population health to a socially acceptable level'. However, the final version was phrased by the Ukrainian Parliament as'reducing environmental risks to minimize their impact on ecosystems, socio-economic development, and public health'.\nAlthough the distinctions are small, the final Parliamentary phrasing appears to already include acknowledgment of a socially acceptable tolerance of risk ['\u2026 minimize their impact on ecosystems, socio-economic development and public health']. Decisions and policies on how to'minimize risk' will be forthcoming, after considerable debate. However, other debates in Parliament demonstrated that there were several problems with their understanding of 'risk'.\nFirst, it represents a top-down perception of risk, meaning that the Parliamentarians and policymakers understand 'risk' primarily in terms of 'hazard' only, focusing on community'safety' as a principal adaptation goal. Such understanding favors specific infrastructure solutions while neglecting other factors of risk, such as poor land use management, outdated building codes, or permissive flood plain zoning. Second, in the minds of Parliamentarians, 'environmental risk' serves as a synonym for 'natural hazard', neglecting anthropogenic impacts on the environment and their adverse effect on measures and actions, intended to mitigate the damage of natural hazards on the populace.\nTo improve understanding of the above-mentioned terms, GWP initiated an institutional governance analysis of the national adaptation of SDGs relying on GWP experience in the promotion of IWRM. Comparing nationally adapted SDGs with the globally accepted ones, GWP came to several important conclusions that all are related to a commitment to water-related global SDGs and compliance with OECD Principles on Water Governance (Demydenko, 2018, 2019):\nFor Ukrainian decision-makers 'water management' still means just 'rational [i.e., economic] water use' that maximizes economic benefits. Such an approach subordinates all other water objectives, focusing only on the observance of existing norms, regulations, and standards to maximize economic outputs.\nThe central government in Ukraine, i.e., its ministries and agencies, are not responsible for the achievement of water-related SDGs, especially for the results of river basin management plans (RBMP) and achievement of the improved condition of all water.\nThe central government still feels entitled to largely disregard Parliament's Environmental Law and distributes over 90% of governmental funding in pursuit of whatever priorities that it deems relevant.\nRecently established River Basin Councils have merely an advisory role to the government in water management and have not been influential in steering the basins towards SDGs \u2013 as yet.\nAs to 'clarity of roles and responsibilities' (OECD Principle 1 on Water Governance), the River Basin Councils remain highly disaggregated and fragmented, limited mainly to infrastructure management \u2013 maintenance, operations, and construction. There is a sizeable gap in the effective and efficient coordination of policies, regulatory reforms, and river basin planning procedures that are essential to deal with the broad issues of water security, climate adaptation, river basin management, and sustainable development \u2013 i.e., the core of IWRM.\nWe see more evidence of the above when looking at Principle 2 (Appropriate scales within basin systems). The RBMPs were formally introduced in the Water"}
{"text":" Code at the end of 2016, but they are to be implemented by basin branches of the Water Agency and to be approved by central government, which has no formal role in water resources management. Furthermore, currently, no agency is formally responsible for oversight of and performance accountability in achieving the 'good state' of water resources by implementing the stated goals, objectives, and action plans of the RBMPs.\nReferring to OECD Principles 3 and 4 (Policy coherence and Capacity), we conclude that cross-sectoral coordination is absent in practice since integrated management is simply understood as developing any water management plan at the basin level, without inclusive stakeholder engagement.\nThere is currently no regulatory framework that provides for environmental liability and responsibility to reach the requisite 'good state' for water resources, therefore no economic mechanism for IWRM could be developed (Principle 6 \u2013 Water pays for water).\nThe provisions of the EU Water Framework and Flood Directives were transposed literally, while in practice, the main goals \u2013 reaching 'good state for all waters' or'reducing flood risks', are not being pursued (Principle 7).\nFinally, as to stakeholder engagement (Principle 10), proposals to manage water 'for all', to introduce the 'water pays for water' principle, and to provide River Basin Councils with decision-making power for truly integrated water management are still pending.\nFormal national adoption of Global SDGs in Ukraine took place only in September 2019, mandated by the Presidential Decree on Ukrainian SDGs (President of Ukraine, 2019). Analyzing this decree and subsequent government action plans using the above-mentioned proposals and recommendations, it is apparent that upon comparing the respective formulations of global versus Ukrainian national water SDGs (GWP Ukraine, 2019), several key governance gaps remain:\nFor the first time since 2002,'sustainable management' was not translated as 'rational use'. However, 'availability' is still translated as 'accessibility', while the words 'for all' are still missing. It indicates that the government still views water management in terms of primary uses, rather than being a water manager for all.\nThe government does not fully accept a commitment to improving freshwater quality and for reaching a 'good state' for all waters. It only accepts the responsibility for reducing pollution by increasing inspectorate and governmental control over compliance with norms. This attitude is demonstrated clearly in that the mandate of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources has been recently reduced to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources only. Government still ignores the obvious conclusions of the National Dialogue that reduction of pollution does not automatically provide for a 'good state'.\nThroughout 30 years of independence of Ukraine, pollution loads haves decreased three-fold, because of de-industrialization of Ukraine, but freshwater quality and availability have not improved accordingly.\nGovernment considers water only as a source of income and economic good, and commitments for sustainable water withdrawal are ignored.\nIWRM implementation is among the formally declared governmental goals, even as IWRM is still incorrectly defined. Instead of Global Indicator SDG6.5.1 Degree of IWRM Implementation (0-100), the National Indicator Number of basin plans is applied as a substitute, thereby demonstrating that the concept of IWRM is incorrectly understood;\nGlobal SDG13.1 mentions efforts to 'increase resilience and adaptive capacity', while the corresponding respective government goal only speaks of the readiness of Ukrainians to adapt to climate change. It uses Reduction of GHG Emissions as the national indicator for adaptation [rather than mitigation], demonstrating that the role of water in climate change adaptation is fully misunderstood and misrepresented, confusing climate mitigation actions with those of adaptation.\nWe can conclude that in water management, as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 'governance is more important than markets' (Meuleman, 2020). While Ukraine is legally and legislatively complying with EU norms for IWRM and sustainable development, their administrative implementation actions of various agencies, regulatory bodies, and River Basin Councils demonstrate a lack of understanding and appreciation for the complexities of these concepts in a practical sense.\nOverall, the results of a GWP-led governance assessment of water-related SDGs implementation can be summarized as follows: while the proper vocabulary of IWRM and sustainable development have been introduced into legislation, the meanings and operational understanding are not yet accepted or correctly interpreted. This applies to the suite of interrelated concepts, such as SDG, IWRM, Adaptation, Resilience, Risk reduction, and OECD Water Governance Principles (Effectiveness, Efficiency, Trust and Engagement).\nIt will take some time before the concepts are not only understood by practitioners but put into practice by them, as well. Many other developed nations have gone through these phases. One should not expect Ukrainian water managers and decision-makers to suddenly begin implementing these complex ideas \u2013 particularly in the difficult circumstances that Ukraine finds itself \u2013 an economic downturn, grave budgetary shortfalls, a war in the eastern region of Donbas, and"}
{"text":" other regional security threats. There are other mechanisms, however, that can be employed to prepare the River Basin Councils, e.g., through the use of collaborative decision-making simulation and optimization models. These are various low-cost collaborative modeling means for exploring various combinations of cost-effective measures that could start addressing the needs of citizens while practicing the principles of SD, IWRM, and climate adaptation (Ray & Brown, 2015; Mendoza et al., 2018).\nRecommendations for further action include several issues: promote further implementation of risk-based IWRM; conduct a second assessment of SDG6.5.1; implementation assessing compliance with the OECD Water Governance Principles; promote reformulation of environmental security and environmental risks in Ukrainian legislation per the definitions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; promote inclusion of water role in adaptation in the second Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement, and promote collaborative risk-based decision models in each of the river basins.\nAll relevant data are included in the paper or its Supplementary Information.\nG.

{"text":"Scaling Sustainability : systems-thinking\nBy Geoff Dooley\nChatting with my colleague Bruce about the world's greatest challenges recently \u2013 he spoke of his dislike for the word \"sustainability\". It is too woolly to be useful and it can mean anything to anyone, he argued.\nHe raised the question \u2013 do we need to simplify sustainability to scale it?\nIn the conversation, I defended the word sustainability. The fact that it is confusing forces us to think harder and to engage with its complexity. It is good that it is not simple. After all simple solutions, allied with defining value in narrow financial terms and ignoring systemic impacts is the major contributor to our sustainability crisis.\nBut the conversation with Bruce got me thinking. Here is my take \u2013 the risk with a clear and simple definition of sustainability is that we will adopt one or a small number of scalable and efficient solutions that create the perverse result of increasing overall systemic risk.\nSystems-thinking and Sustainability\nLet's examine this idea. Most will agree that sustainability is a systemic problem. A system can be thought of as a network of nodes and links. Nodes are identifiable actors like nations, species, ecosystems, or organisations. Links are the relationships between the nodes.\nSustainability is intertwined with all our major systems, such as manufacturing systems and economic systems, political, social, and cultural systems, and technological and legal systems. And each of these systems is connected with the other.\nWhen a system reaches this level of complexity, it can no longer be controlled from the top. Through the networks created by billions of micro-decisions, the system is in charge.\nStability, Resilience and Chaos Theory\nA feature of systems is that they are inherently stable \u2013 albeit the individual system components can be chaotic. A chaos of countervailing forces is sustainable and stable because individual forces are prevented from running amok by their countervailing opposites.\nHowever, if a specific force within a system becomes overly dominant, then the chaos of countervailing forces no longer balances, and the system becomes unstable and unsustainable. The current and obvious example is the overwhelming force that humanity is exerting on planet Earth.\nWhen a system becomes terminally unstable (i.e., it cannot restore balance from within its current state) it will flip into an alternative and entirely new state where stability is achievable. By definition, this new state will dampen the impact of the force that caused the instability in the previous state. Because, in the long run, the system will have its way regardless.\nA resilient system has nodes that behave in a diversity of ways and the links between them are weak. If the nodes behave in similar ways and are strongly linked \u2013 then the system is fragile. This is because when a fragile system becomes perturbed, the response of the nodes synchronises and the strong links between the nodes accelerate the perturbation across the system.\nTherefore, counterintuitively common standards can be problematic. Take for example the EU Taxonomy which on the one hand makes trade and finance between organisations (where organisations are the nodes) quicker, easier and cheaper while on the other hand, it is also designed to ensure that all those organisations behave in the same way.\nThis means that any error or miscalculation in the starting conditions for the EU Taxonomy could have a tumultuous impact at the system level. From this perspective, the inclusion of fossil gas and nuclear as green investments within the EU Taxonomy quite rightly became a lightning rod for controversy. If their inclusion distorts the starting conditions for a sustainable finance pathway, then systemic imbalance will be amplified and accelerated.\nThe tell-tale signal that a system is approaching a tipping point, where it might be about to flip states to regain stability, is that it begins to flicker \u2013 that its range of behavior broadens, and becomes more unpredictable or volatile. Hence, when we look at the relationship between climate and weather, food and energy, political instability and migration, or the rapid spread of infectious diseases, these can be regarded as indicators of a system in flicker mode.\nThe intuitive response to the sustainability challenge is to further harmonise standards across nodes and strengthen links between them so as to accelerate our response. This is what Bruce is arguing for. He wants to simplify sustainability to make it easier to implement and less open to interpretation.\nSystemic Risk\nHowever, systems theory advises that reducing systemic risk requires increasing the number and diversity of nodes, making them smaller, weakening the links between them, compartmentalising sub-systems and increasing overall redundancy (i.e., make everything less efficient).\nVirtually every sustainability policy we have is seeking to do the opposite. We are going in this direction because we have gotten ourselves into such a mess that we have no choice but to try solutions that can spread at speed and at scale. Sometimes you are left with no choice but to take a high-risk option. But in doing so, there is no margin for error. Bruce is correct!"}

{"text":"By Tim Siglin Contributing Editor\nStreams of Thought\nNetflix's Stock Price Tumbles as Higher Prices Lead to Churn\nJuly 2019 was an opportune month to buy Netflix stock, shortly after the company announced its Q2 results. Overall revenue was up, year over year, by 26% to $4.92 billion, meaning that earnings per share (EPS) beat analysts' estimates by an impressive 8.16%. The company's cash on hand was up to $5 billion, an increase of 28.11% compared to a year prior, meaning it added around $1.6 billion to its war chest.\nBy all measures, beating EPS estimates is a formula for a stock to rise. But as we've seen with Apple's stock price, sometimes rational discussions give way to disproportionate expectations. And in Netflix's case, because the company only beat EPS expectations by single digits\u2014rather than the 30% average of the prior three quarters\u2014the stock took a beating.\nThe argument for the subsequent sell-off of Netflix\u2014the stock dropped off precipitously, losing 10% over the course of 2 days\u2014was a decrease in subscriber growth in the U.S. market. Netflix lost 126,000 paid subscribers in the U.S., even though its overall gain in subscribers was more than 2.7 million for the quarter.\nPerhaps due to the expectation that Netflix constantly beats EPS estimates, analysts had expected 5 million subscribers to be added during the quarter. The fact that only half that number were added, as well as the fact that subscribers in Netflix's home market declined, led to the stock being hammered. From July 10, when Netflix closed at $381, to July 17, when it was trading at $362.44 just before the earnings announcement, the stock had traded within about a 5% range. After the earnings and subscriber shortfall announcement, the stock lost 16% of its value and closed at $307.30. It has fallen even further as of this writing, closing at $299.11 on Aug. 14. In other words, in roughly a month, the stock went from $381 to $299.11, a drop of about 21% overall.\nWhat's interesting, at a cursory glance, is just why a Q2 2019 drop of 126,000 subscribers\u2014less than two-tenths of 1 percent in the U.S. market, where Netflix had 60.2 million subscribers in Q1 2019\u2014caused such an uproar.\nIt turns out\u2014and this is the warning for OTT-based services\u2014that the subscriber drops were in parts of the U.S. market where Netflix had chosen to raise prices.\nWhat's also interesting is that this coincides with a recent finding that customers in the U.S.\u2014the most mature market for Netflix subscriptions\u2014are not going to tolerate price increases beyond a certain point, with $21 per month being the rate consumers are most comfortable with. That means that as Netflix increased monthly subscription prices, something had to give. And what consumers gave up was the Netflix subscription. (It brings up an interesting question: What term do we use for this? Do we call this churn or cordless cutting?)\nSo why do I say that July was a good month to buy Netflix stock? Two reasons.\nFirst, the earnings report didn't cover Stranger Things season 3, which launched the week after Q2 ended. Netflix is expecting 7 million subscribers to be added in Q3, including a bump in U.S.-based subscribers, thanks in no small part to Stranger Things.\nSecond, the company's international growth is solid. Back when Netflix had limited uptake in foreign markets, analysts complained that it wasn't diversified enough across the globe. So it goes almost without saying that the brouhaha around a microscopic drop in subscribers in the company's most maturing market is a tempest in a teapot.\nIf the industry is listening, there's a very solid lesson for Amazon, Disney, Hulu, Sling TV, and a host of other OTT players: The market has price elasticity, but it's not nearly as elastic as it was a few years ago.\n[This article appears in the September 2019 issue of Streaming Media Magazine as \"How Much Is Too Much?\"]\nA look at streaming media's past can give us guidance on our journey toward where we're heading next\nThe Math Behind the Magic\nWhether we're talking about content delivery, player performance, live events, or even DRM, it's important to understand the algorithms that make streaming video tick.\nNetflix Goes to the Other Side of the Mirror With Bandersnatch\nLearn the streaming challenges Netflix faced presenting Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, which gave viewers choices and advanced interactive storytelling.\n$21: The Amount Consumers Want to Pay Barely Covers Two Services\nHouseholds are reacting to new OTT offerings by tightening their belts and closing their wallets.

Achieving simultaneous highly efficient and stable unassisted PEC water splitting has been the \"holy grail\" in clean and renewable fuel generation. State-of-the-art photoelectrodes have shown relatively high efficiencies (\u223c10\u201320%). Still, their stability is limited due to photoelectrode chemical instability, electrolyte resistance, mass transfer issues, and an often unoptimized experimental setup. In this work, we present a framework and a set of protocols for conducting long-term stability experiments and further provide details on several critical factors such as light source calibration, choosing the right counter electrode, the configuration of the PEC cell, and photoelectrode sample preparation.\nAn essential requirement for large-scale commercialization of PEC water splitting is the device's durability against harsh electrolytes and under dark and different illumination intensities (Nandjou and Haussener, 2017; Kaneko et al., 2018). Due to the intermittency of solar radiation, the degradation of PEC devices is more accelerated than photovoltaic-electrolyzer devices (Shaner et al., 2016). Most of the high-efficiency semiconductors for PEC like Si (King et al., 2017; Ros et al., 2017) and III-V (Britto et al., 2016) are easily prone to chemical corrosion in the electrolyte (even under dark conditions). Si is easily oxidized to SiO2 in an aqueous solution (see Eq. 1) and forms a passivation layer on the Si surface, leading to a reduction (Kainthla et al., 1986).\nSi+2OH\u2212+4H2O \u2192Si(OH)22++2H2+4OH\u2212(1)\nIII-V compounds, like GaAs, also go through corrosion reactions (see Eq. 2) due to either accumulation of a large surface hole concentration in the dark or light illumination, generating holes at the surface (Lewerenz, 2014). However, p-type III-arsenide semiconductors have shown remarkable stability under conditions where an As0 enriched surface provides passivation against corrosion (Young et al., 2016).\nGaAs+6h++H2O+aq \u2192Gaaq3++2AsO2\u2212+4H+(2)\nIt was observed that N-terminated III-nitride nanostructures show virtually no chemical or photoelectrochemical corrosions when in contact with different electrolytes (Kibria et al., 2016; AlOtaibi et al., 2013; Vanka et al., 2018; Varadhan et al., 2017). Recent studies further revealed that the surfaces of such III-nitride nanostructures could be transformed to oxynitride, which leads to improved PEC performance, instead of degradation, under both one-sun and concentrated sunlight illumination (Zeng et al., 2021). Mi et al. reported one of the longest stability (>3,000 h) using an N-terminated multifunctional GaN nanowire protection scheme on Si photocathode (Vanka et al., 2019) and demonstrated durability under accelerated testing conditions (Zeng et al., 2021). Furthermore, Mi et al. demonstrated high stability of >100 h under a two-electrode experimental setup by utilizing single (STH \u223c3%) (Wang et al., 2019) and double junction (STH \u223c10%) (Vanka et al.,"}
{"text":" 2020) InGaN\/Si photocathodes. The underlying thermodynamic and kinetics of N-terminated (In)GaN nanostructures have been investigated in previous publications (Vanka et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2021; Vanka et al., 2019; Vanka et al., 2020; He et al., 2019). The basic stability criteria for conduction band minimum (\u03d5CB) and valence band maximum (\u03d5VB) of a photoelectrode include: \u03d5CB below \u03d5corre and \u03d5VB above \u03d5corrh (Chen and Wang, 2012), where \u03d5corre is energy level for cathodic corrosion reaction of semiconductor and \u03d5corrh is energy level for anodic corrosion reaction of semiconductor (Chen and Wang, 2012). If \u03d5corre and \u03d5corrh fall within the energy bandgap, then the material tends to become corroded or etched under PEC conditions. Furthermore, to avoid the competition of cathodic and anodic photocorrosion with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, the photoelectrode must satisfy the criteria: \u03d5corre above Ecathodic (0 V vs. NHE (Chen and Wang, 2012)) and \u03d5corrh below Eanodic [\u22121.23 V vs. NHE (Chen and Wang, 2012)]. None of the semiconductor materials shown in Figure 1 (Chen and Wang, 2012) satisfy both thermodynamic conditions of stability. In addition to these considerations, excess charge carriers in the photoaborber (mainly metal oxides) will lead to lattice distortions and form localized polarons (Di Valentin and Selloni, 2011; Janotti et al., 2014; Butler et al., 2016). These polarons can inhibit the charge transfer kinetics and affect the interface catalysis process. Thus, electron-hole pair recombination via polarons may hamper the stability of the photoelectrode. Although theoretically PEC water splitting requires 1.23 V, depending on the type of the photoelectrode, co-catalysts, and electrolyte, overpotentials for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution vary, and the redox potential lies typically in the range of 1.4\u20131.9 V (Chen et al., 2011; Shaner et al., 2016). Application of co-catalysts (e.g., Pt) on the photoelectrode surface provides kinetic protection by directing photogenerated charge carriers towards the favored water-splitting half reactions instead of corrosion reactions (Nandjou and Haussener, 2017). Therefore, the primary role of co-catalysts is to reduce the redox overpotential, facilitate the mass transfer, and efficient charge carrier extraction (Chen et al., 2011; Kaneko et al., 2018).\nFIGURE 1. Calculated \u03d5corre (black bars) and \u03d5corrh (red bars) relative to NHE and vacuum level for various semiconductor photoelectrodes pH = 0 solutions, ambient temperature 298.15 K, and pressure 1 bar.

Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society.\nOver the years, various protection schemes have been employed to enhance the stability of both photocathode and photoanode. The first approach (see Figure 2A) uses relatively thick metal oxide such as TiO2 (Ros et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018), Al2O3 (Fan et al., 2015), or IrOx (Mei et al., 2014) as passivation layers for photocathode and photoanode. Even though the stability performance has improved substantially (Ros et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018), the major issue is photocurrent loss due to poor charge carrier transfer kinetics and light absorption (Kaneko et al., 2018). In addition, these protective layers suffer from the presence of pinholes and often involve the use of additional deposition methods, such as ALD. Henceforth, during stability testing, these pinholes may act as catalytic degradation sites, which eventually leads to exposure of the photoelectrode to the electrolyte solution (Ros et al., 2017; Ben-Naim et al., 2020). Moon et al. observed in their stability experiments a decrease in photocurrent density and photovoltage for TiO2 protected III-V triple-junction solar cell photocathode (Moon et al., 2020). This performance degradation is due to the pinholes within the TiO2 layer, which erodes the top junction by allowing acidic electrolyte solution to dissolve the top junction and ultimately lead to delamination (Moon et al., 2020). The second approach"}
{"text":" (see Figure 2B) is to couple photoelectrode with a highly active catalyst, simultaneously improving stability and maintaining excellent reaction kinetics by efficiently extracting the photogenerated charge carriers (Nandjou and Haussener, 2017). One of the best stabilities achieved for a photocathode (\u223c60 days) with a relatively low photocurrent was reported by (King et al., 2017) using MoS2 on Si. Furthermore, high two-electrode stability for GaInAsP\/GaAs with MoS2 protection under 2.6 suns illumination was reported recently (Ben-Naim et al., 2020). Interface losses and device complexity limit the performance of these devices. Although Si photoanode with NiCrOx\/TiO2 protection (Shaner et al., 2015) showed high stability of \u223c2,200 h, the photocurrent density is low, and the applied bias is greater than 1.23 V vs. NHE. Furthermore, hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) showed considerable stability (Dias et al., 2016; Kuang et al., 2016). The highest stability for nanostructured BiVO4 photoanode is >1,000 h using in-situ on-demand NiFe catalyst regeneration (Kuang et al., 2016). The primary issue with the metal-oxides is their low efficiencies because of the limitations in bulk transport of charge carriers and their wide bandgaps (Bae et al., 2017). Another exciting set of stable water splitting electrodes, which have gained attraction over the past decade, is self-healing\/self-repairing catalysts. These (photo)electrodes\/catalysts (Kanan and Nocera, 2008; Lutterman et al., 2009; Najafpour et al., 2015; Costentin and Nocera, 2017; Feng et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2021) with the capacity to renew themselves during the water-splitting reaction require special protocols to evaluate the origins of their stability (Zeng et al., 2021). These protocols are beyond the scope of this work.\nFIGURE 2. (A) Schematic showing the conventional thick protective layer with a catalyst on top of the light absorber. (B) Schematic showing the photoelectrode with catalyst layer as a protective layer. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from Vanka et al. (2019). Copyright 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nAn important factor in the stability measurements is the configuration of the PEC cell. As discussed earlier, most of the photoelectrodes are relatively stable in a three-electrode configuration (Vanka et al., 2019), but few devices can reach 100 h under a two-electrode (zero-bias) PEC configuration (Ben-Naim et al., 2020; Vanka et al., 2020). Three-electrode PEC configuration accounts for only the stability of the working photoelectrode ignoring the performance of the counter electrode and the overall PEC system stability (Chen et al., 2011). On the other hand, the two-electrode PEC configuration gives the actual efficiency and durability under a realistic operating environment of the entire PEC cell, including both the working electrode and counter electrode (Hodes, 2012). Thus, it is crucial to perform the stability tests for the photoelectrodes in a two-electrode configuration under AM1.5G one-sun illumination to understand the real stability of the device. While this work focuses on continuous illumination over long durations, understanding PEC system durability under intermittent illumination is also essential for moving this technology from the bench to the field. Henceforth, it is pertinent to develop standard benchmarking stability protocols for the two and three-electrode configurations to permit researchers to evaluate the stability performance of the photoelectrodes against state-of-the-art devices and thereby accelerate the progress of PEC technology for large-scale deployment.\nSummary of Method\nThe stability experiments are essential to gain insights into the lifetime of the material. These experiments are conducted by recording the photocurrent against time under continuously applied bias in a two- or three-electrode configuration (Chen et al., 2011). As discussed earlier (see Figure 1), for most materials without protection schemes photocorrosion is thermodynamically favorable compared to HER or OER in an aqueous environment under illumination. The main cause is the accumulation of excess photogenerated charge carriers (holes or electrons), leading to side reactions (such as self-reduction or oxidation) (Su et al., 2017). Therefore, during stability experiments, it is recommended to quantify the evolved H2 and O2 to determine FE and STH (Chen et al., 2011). Photocorrosion is indicated by the degradation of photocurrent and\/or LSV characteristics (such as onset"}
{"text":" potential, saturation photocurrent, and fill-factor) with time (Yang et al., 2019). The stability (or CA) experiments are conducted until the failure point, i.e., when the device photocurrent shows a significant drop at a given voltage. As shown in the flowchart (see Figure 3). The stability evaluation of the photoelectrode starts with either CV or LSV scans. These scans reveal whether the photoelectrode has favorable characteristics such as good photocurrent onset voltage, high photocurrent density, and high STH. After determining the photoelectrode photocurrent density vs. voltage (J-V) characteristics, the device's CA response is measured in an aqueous electrolyte under AM1.5G one sun or concentrated sunlight illumination with no bias (0 V vs. counter electrode) in a two-electrode configuration. The J-V characteristics of the photoelectrode are periodically recorded during the stability experiments to evaluate whether the sample has degraded (reduction in photocurrent density or onset potential). Once the device reaches its catastrophic failure point, physical failure modes observed microscopically, and spectroscopic analysis of chemical transformations can be coupled with electrochemical procedures to inform the degradation mechanism.\nFIGURE 3.

Copyright 2012 EDP Sciences.\nSpectroscopy and electron microscopy provide further insight into the failure mechanism via structural analysis. Using these techniques, we can effectively compare the chemical transformation of the surface morphology before and after the photoelectrochemical reaction, while such chemical transformation either leads to catastrophic degradation or self-healing\/self-improving (Kanan and Nocera, 2008; Malara et al., 2016; Toma et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2021). Either way, the knowledge we obtain through structural analysis will provide feedback for further optimization of our device. Toma et al. (2016) employed EC-AFM to monitor the corrosion of BiVO4 and provide mechanistic insights into the chemical and photochemical instability of this material, which can be used to guide approaches for further improvement of BiVO4 photoanode. On the other hand, self-improving via chemical transformation can also be revealed by structural analysis. Zeng et al. (2021) reported that GaN can achieve self-improvement during HER by forming an ultrathin layer of gallium oxynitride, which led to lower overpotential, and higher charge transfer efficiency, and improved durability.\nElectrochemical potentiostat- This is the essential equipment required to conduct J-V, Mott-Schottky, OCP, and CA experiments.\nGC- A GC analyzer is required to detect hydrogen and oxygen gas products during PEC reactions. This equipment is also used to determine FE (Chen et al., 2011) and H2 gas evolution rates.\nICP-MS- ICP-MS is essential to determine any dissolved photoelectrode material, co-catalysts, and other metals\/non-metals in electrolyte solution during the reaction (Deutsch et al., 2006).\nSEM- This is one of the most used techniques to determine the morphological changes before and after stability experiments, with resolutions in the range of a few nanometers to sub-micrometer scale.\nSTEM- STEM is essential in analyzing nanometer, or atomic-scale feature sizes by using annular dark-field imaging, spectroscopic mapping by EDX, or EELS.\nAFM- AFM scans provide nanometer resolution images of the top surface. For 2D films, AFM is sufficient to understand the surface degradation after stability experiments. However, for 1D nanostructures, this technique may be somewhat limited. Therefore, it is preferred to use SEM or STEM for 1D photoelectrodes. As mentioned earlier, in-situ AFM measurements such as EC-AFM and PC-AFM are instrumental in determining the nanoscale origin of photocurrent (Eichhorn et al., 2018; Nellist et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2021).\nXPS- This technique helps identify the elements, chemical states, and electronic structure of the photoelectrode material.\nXRD- XRD scans provide critical information for structural changes of the photoelectrode materials, such as crystal structures, phases, defects, and strain distribution."}
{"text":" Therefore, any changes in crystallinity of the material revealed by XRD scans can provide critical information regarding photocorrosion on the surfaces.\nReagents- Alkaline solution (potassium hydroxide, etc.), acid solution (sulfuric acid, etc.), and deionized water.\nThe essential protocols, based on the authors' practical experience (Vanka et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2021), needed for performing long term stability tests for >1,000 h are:\n1. PEC cell design: The major parameters impacting the PEC cell performance include electrolyte solution\/volume and the ionic path length (Hern\u00e1ndez-Pag\u00e1n et al., 2012). The PEC cells (or reactors) can be classified based on compartmentalization. As shown in Figure 3A, both wired and wireless electrode assembly configurations can be implemented in PEC cells comprising either a single or double compartment (Bosserez et al., 2015). A major limitation of single compartment PEC cells (see Figure 3A) is that evolving H2 and O2 gases are mixed in the same chamber, which leads to recombination reactions. These unwanted chemical reactions can be avoided by producing H2 and O2 in separate compartments using an H-cell (see Figure 3B). An important issue with unsealed PEC cells is the presence of atmospheric oxygen, which often produces deleterious effects on the water-splitting experiments (Hagfeldt et al., 1995). Using a dual compartment cell (see Figure 3C) with SEA helps seal off the sample from the environment and thus prevents air from entering the cell (Bosserez et al., 2015). In addition, this cell (see Figure 3C) has in- and outlet connections for feeding electrolyte solution and product collection, respectively. It is also essential to design proper compression cells to minimize bubbling and\/or electrolyte resistance (Vanka et al., 2019). Furthermore, it is highly desirable that the cells have various aperture openings to properly test samples of different sizes.\n2. Back contacts: Dissolution of epoxy accelerates photoelectrode degradation (Bae et al., 2019; Vanka et al., 2019), and dissolved silver may lead to dubious results in surface-sensitive XPS\/ICP-MS analysis. Thus, it is essential to eliminate epoxy and silver paste by designing the compression cell with a metal pad, which allows the front side of the sample to be exposed to the electrolyte with the backside of the sample making electrical contact with the metal pad.\n3. Electrolyte: In many cases, PEC experiments are conducted in near-neutral pH electrolyte solutions because of safety concerns and exacerbation of pinholes issues in the protection layers (as discussed earlier) under extremely acidic or alkaline electrolyte solutions (which are used in commercial electrolyzers) (Obata et al., 2020). However, the major disadvantage of using such pH-neutral conditions is the low concentration of H+\/OH\u2212 in the electrolyte solutions. At such low concentrations, the reactants are rapidly consumed during CA experiments, and their refurbishment from the other electrolyte regions is hampered by mass transport limitations (Shinagawa and Takanabe, 2015a). This concentration imbalance leads to extra overpotentials in addition to kinetic overpotentials from catalysts (Shinagawa and Takanabe, 2015b; Ahmet et al., 2019). Furthermore, in an H-cell (see Figure 3B) with no buffer in the electrolyte solution, the generation of H2 and O2 gases in separate compartments leads to elevated and reduced pH, respectively. The local pH shift in the electrolyte solution during PCET reactions near the photoelectrode surface is a critical in factor determining its stability and efficiency. To mitigate this issue, buffer ions are added to the electrolyte solution. However, it is hard to eliminate the local pH gradient as the diffusion coefficients of buffer ions are smaller compared to those of H+\/OH\u2212 ions (Shinagawa and Takanabe, 2016; Ahmet et al., 2019).\n4. Counter electrode: The counter electrode plays a vital role in determining the stability of the entire PEC cell (Hodes, 2012). Some counter electrodes dissolve in the electrolyte during the reaction and can be plated on the photoelectrode, complicating PEC analysis (Choi et al., 2014). Thus, choosing stable counter electrodes and constructing a PEC compression cell with a membrane is important to prevent unwanted metal deposition on the photoelectrode surface.\nInstrument or Method Calibration and Standardization\nLight source intensity: The light source needs to be regularly recalibrated to maintain 100 mW\/cm2 power density throughout the stability test (Chen et al., 2011), especially if it is not continuously measured over time.\nElectrochemical potentiostat: It is quintessential to calibrate these instruments by following the vendor"}
{"text":"'s recommendations correctly to obtain reliable and consistent results.\nExample of Pt-Decorated GaN\/Si Photocathode Stability\nHere we explain the three-electrode stability measurements of N-terminated GaN\/Si photocathode considering the protocols mentioned earlier.\nStep 1: From Figure 4, the first basic step is to calibrate the light source to 100 mW\/cm2. Mi et al. used Si (bandgap \u223c1.1 eV) reference cell to calibrate their light source for GaN\/Si photocathode (Vanka et al., 2018).\nFIGURE 4. Flowchart illustrating the steps for performing long-term stability experiments.\nStep 2: From Figures 5A,B, LSV scans show photocurrent onset voltage \u223c0.56 V vs. NHE, high saturation photocurrent density \u223c37 mA\/cm2 and ABPE \u223c11.9% (at 0.37 V vs. NHE) (Vanka et al., 2018; Vanka et al., 2019). As discussed earlier and shown in Figure 4, using the best sample for stability experiments in terms of high ABPE and excellent LSV characteristics is essential. The morphology of the 1D nanowires with co-catalyst nanoparticles is determined using STEM and SEM techniques (Vanka et al., 2018; Vanka et al., 2019). However, as discussed earlier, the AFM technique may be challenging for analyzing 1D nanowires and catalyst nanoparticles. Figure 5C shows the STEM image of the Pt decorated GaN\/Si photocathode before CA experiments.\nFIGURE 5. (A) LSV comparison of GaN\/Si photocathode before and after 3,000 h stability experiments. (B) ABPE of Pt decorated GaN\/Si photocathode before stability experiments in 0.5 M H2SO4 under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination. (C) STEM image of Pt decorated GaN nanowire before stability experiment. (D) Ultra-long term stability experiments using GaN\/Si photocathode under continuous AM 1.5G one-sun illumination. (E) STEM image of Pt decorated GaN nanowire after 3,000 h stability experiments. (F) ICP-MS measurements of liquid samples at different runs during the experiment. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from Vanka et al. (2019). Copyright 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nStep 3: For the GaN\/Si photocathode samples having ABPE >10%, CA experiments are performed in a three-electrode PEC configuration at 0 V vs. NHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 under AM 1.5G one sun (Vanka et al., 2018; Vanka et al., 2019). Zeng et al. demonstrated that the photocurrent density of GaN\/Si photocathode does not degrade under concentrated sunlight (\u223c3 suns) illumination for 150 h (Zeng et al., 2021).\nStep 4: LSV scans are measured after every run (each run is about 22\u201324 h duration). As shown in Figure 4, these scans need to be compared with the J-V characteristics before starting the stability experiments to determine whether to proceed further with the CA stability experiments or not (Vanka et al., 2019).\nStep 5: The GaN\/Si photocathode showed a decrement in photocurrent density, and J-V characteristics changed dramatically after 113 h (Vanka et al., 2018). By performing the structural analysis (STEM and SEM), the root cause of this degradation was attributed to the loss of Pt co-catalyst nanoparticles on the GaN nanowire surface (Vanka et al., 2018). Thus, to maintain the J-V and CA characteristics of GaN\/Si photocathode over long periods of stability testing, it is pertinent to regenerate the co-catalyst regularly.\nStep 6: Using a new sample (with the same J-V characteristics mentioned in step 2), the experiment is repeated from step 1. In this run, catalyst regeneration is implemented after approximately every 24 h to achieve long-term stability of >3,000 h (Vanka et al., 2019) (see Figure 5D) with no degradation in J-V performance after the experiments (see Figure 5A).\nStep 7: The ultra-long stability (CA) experiments for GaN\/Si photocathode are stopped after 3,000 h. From Figure 5E, STEM analysis reveals no apparent degradation in GaN nanowire dimensions and fewer Pt co-catalyst nanoparticles on the GaN surface than in Figure 5C (Vanka et al., 2019). Furthermore, ICP-MS (Figure 5F) shows that GaN remains stable throughout the CA experiments. Thus, the structural analysis and theoretical studies reveal that the stability of Pt decorated GaN\/Si photocathode is limited by Pt nanoparticles"}
{"text":" rather than GaN\/Si light absorber (Vanka et al., 2018; Vanka et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2021).\nThis work provides an overview of the stability requirements of a photoelectrode and the pertinent need to develop standard protocols for long-term stability measurements in a two-electrode and three-electrode configuration. We have illustrated a framework to evaluate the stability of photoelectrode with an optimized experimental setup based on light source calibration, counter electrode optimization, PEC chamber, and sample preparation. The GaN\/Si photoelectrode example showed how these protocols lead to proper stability measurements of the device and further improve the performance by understanding the degradation mechanism. We believe that for future stability studies, these benchmarking protocols can serve as valuable guidelines in accelerating the search for new photoelectrodes which can cut the \"Gordian knot\" of simultaneously achieving ultra-high stability (>10,000 h) and high efficiency (>15%).\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

{"text":"Great Lakes Flooding: The Warning Signs That Homes Must Be Moved\nOct. 17, 2019 10:54AM EST Insights + Opinion\nChicago skyline on July 22 as high winds continue to push the waters of Lake Michigan over the top of the pedestrian and bike trail along the lakefront in Chicago. Raymond Boyd \/ Michael Ochs Archives \/ Getty Images\nBy Daniel Macfarlane\nEvery fall, I take my environmental studies class camping at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore on Lake Michigan. Some years the beach extends more than three meters to the water. This year, in many spots, there was no beach at all.\nThe story is the same throughout the Great Lakes. During my summer research trip to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, I lost track of the number of submerged docks and buildings; swimming near the shore of Lake Huron was a bad idea because of the high risk of electrocution from inundated boathouses that still had the juice flowing.\nWater levels in the Great Lakes have always fluctuated. But climate change is throwing past patterns out of whack. Almost every Great Lake reached record levels in 2019. And the latest studies predict that levels might reach even higher in 2020.\nBut instead of engineered solutions, we should be concentrating on getting out of the way.\nBiggest Impacts\nLake Michigan's high water levels consumed beaches at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in 2019. Daniel Macfarlane \/ Author provided\nMy research looks at the ways that Canada and the U.S., along with the bilateral International Joint Commission, have tried to understand and control water in the Great-Lakes St. Lawrence River Basin for well more than a century.\nBoth countries have made large diversions in and out of the Great Lakes, such as the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, as well as numerous smaller diversions and canals.\nIn the 1950s, dams along the St. Lawrence transformed this gigantic river into a hydropower pool and navigation channel and, controversially, to help regulate water levels in Lake Ontario. Control works in the St. Marys River partially regulate Lake Superior. Niagara Falls is treated like a tap to generate both hydropower and beauty. Then there is the 100-plus years of perpetually dredging channels and harbours for navigation.\nCumulatively, these anthropogenic interventions have likely changed water levels on the lakes by less than one meter.\nMeanwhile, communities have steadily encroached on the water. We turned seasonal sandbars into subdivisions. Metropolises like Toronto and Chicago extended their footprints hundreds of meters into the lake.\nAnd it's not only large dams, diversions and cities that have impacts. Thousands of small individual actions add up, such as the breakwalls, retaining walls and the rip-rap (graded stone or crushed rock) property owners erect to protect boathouses, cottages and other structures.\nCollectively, we might be the proverbial fool who built our house on sand \u2014 often literally.\nThese engineered interventions have myriad ecological impacts and unintended consequences, such as invasive species and impaired water quality. They've also instilled a societal hubris that we can \u2014 and should \u2014 control water on a large scale in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system.\nNatural Supply\nHigh water levels inundate a waterfront home on the St. Lawrence River in May 2017.\nMike Beauregard \/ Flickr \/ CC BY\nHowever, natural forces \u2014 rain, snow, ice cover, temperature, evaporation \u2014 are the biggest determinant of water levels in the Great Lakes.\nAs long as humans have kept records, Great Lakes water levels have oscillated. Depending on which of the Great Lakes one considers, the maximum range of water level fluctuations has been about one to two meters in the past 150 years. For example, very high water occurred in the early 1950s, early 1970s, mid-1980s and mid-1990s.\nNow, pushed by a changing climate, the swings in levels that used to take several decades are occurring in half a decade. Instead of a gradual rise and fall, the lakes are going from extreme to extreme.\nFor example, Lakes Michigan and Huron hit record lows in 2013, and docks on Georgian Bay didn't reach the water. To compensate, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed putting riffles, basically water speed bumps, on the bottom of Lake Huron's outflow at the St. Clair River.\nNow Lake Huron is close to record high levels and docks are under water. If those St. Clair riffles had been installed, the water levels on Lakes Huron and Michigan would be even higher today. This is the type of short-sighted thinking we need to avoid.\nMoving Back\nWater needs breathing space. We need to move out of the way, rather than try to move water out of our way.\nHumans have removed, impaired or destroyed many of the lakes' natural buffers, which accommodate"}
{"text":" fluctuating water. We've eradicated shoreline wetlands and beaches and covered them with concrete.\nIf a property along the Great Lakes is getting wet now, it will almost certainly be wetter in the future. While there is some scientific uncertainty about exactly what climate change will do to water levels, the extreme highs and lows will get worse. Volatility is the new normal.\nLike climate change, when it comes to addressing Great Lakes levels, the biggest hurdles aren't scientific \u2014 they are political, economic and social.\nAny new infrastructure along Great Lakes shorelines must be flexible, adaptable and resilient.\nBut we must also realize that the answer isn't more infrastructure. Infrastructure is too often the cause of our environmental issues.\nWe need to remove structures entirely and avoid building anything near the water's edge. This will have the added benefit of making more of the Great Lakes accessible to everyone. Since governments zoned vulnerable areas for construction, government funding should be provided.\nWe should use the opportunity to restore natural shorelines and wetlands. These provide many benefits for both water quality and water quantity. In terms of the latter, they can serve as water retention areas, while wetland plants provide erosion control.\nThis is all going to be very hard for many people to hear \u2014 there will be major resistance. But not moving is going to cost more in the long run. We think we can control water levels, but we need to think differently.\nReposting with permission from our media associate The Conversation.\nTons of Plastic Trash Enter the Great Lakes Every Year \u2013 Where... \u203a\nThe Battle for Rights of Nature Heats Up in the Great Lakes... \u203a\nCoastal Flooding Could Threaten Millions and Cost Trillions by 2100, New Study Finds - EcoWatch \u203a\nClimate Change Sends Great Lakes Water Levels Seesawing... \u203a\n'Bigger picture, it's climate change': Great Lakes flood ravages... \u203a\nThe Great Lakes are overflowing with record amounts of water - The... \u203a\ngreat lakes flooding chicago lake michigan\nA wild mink in Utah was the first wild animal in the U.S. found with COVID-19. Peter Trimming via Wikipedia, CC BY-SA\nBy Jonathan Runstadler and Kaitlin Sawatzki\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found coronavirus infections in pet cats and dogs and in multiple zoo animals, including big cats and gorillas. These infections have even happened when staff were using personal protective equipment.\n<p>More disturbing, in December the United States Department of Agriculture confirmed the first case of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/12\/15\/science\/covid-wild-mink-utah.html\" target=\"_blank\">wild animal infected with SARS-CoV-2<\/a>, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Earlier this month, veterinarians at the San Diego Zoo announced that the zoo's <a href=\"https:\/\/zoo.sandiegozoo.org\/pressroom\/news-releases\/gorilla-troop-san-diego-zoo-safari-park-test-positive-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">troop of gorillas was infected with SARS\u2013CoV\u20132<\/a>. This indicated it is possible for this virus to jump from humans to our close relatives.<\/p><p>Some viruses tend to stay in a single species or in closely related species, while other viruses seem innately more capable of large species jumps. Influenza, for example, can infect a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/flu\/other\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wide variety of animals, from sparrows to whales<\/a>. Similarly, coronaviruses are known to <a href=\"https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038%2Fs41579-018-0118-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regularly jump between species<\/a>.<\/p><p>The question of how many and which species can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 and which ones might be able to support continued circulation of the virus \u2013 is an important one.<\/p>\n<h2>Searching for COVID-19 in Wildlife<\/h2><p>For human-to-wildlife spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to occur, an animal needs to be exposed to a high-enough viral dose to become infected.<\/p><p>The highest-risk situations are during direct contact with humans, such as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/01\/science\/Covid-bats.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">veterinarian's caring for an injured animal<\/a>. Contact between a sick person and a pet or farm animal also poses a risk, as the domestic animal could act as an intermediate host, eventually passing the virus to a wild animal.<\/p><p>Another way COVID-19 could spill over from humans into animals is through indirect infection, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/smart-news\/can-marine-mammals-catch-covid-19-new-study-says-its-possible-180976471\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">such as through wastewater<\/a>. COVID-19 and other pathogens can be detected in waste streams, many of which end up dumped, untreated, into environments where wildlife like marine mammals may be exposed. This is thought to be how <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0062259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elephant seals in California became infected with H1N1 influenza<\/a> during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.<\/p><p>To study whether spillover of SARS-CoV-2 is happening, our team at Tufts is partnering with veterinarians and licensed wildlife rehabilitators across the U.S. to collect samples from and test animals in their care. Through the project, we have tested nearly 300 wild animals from over 20 species. So far, none \u2013 from bats to seals to coyotes \u2013 have shown any evidence of COVID-19 by swab or antibody tests.<\/p><p>Other researchers have launched targeted surveillance of wild animals in places where captive animals have been infected. The first confirmed infection in a wild mink was found during <a href=\"https:\/\/promedmail.org\/promed-post\/?id=8015608\" target=\"_blank\">surveillance near an infected mink farm<\/a>. It's not yet clear how this wild mink got the coronavirus, but the high density of infected minks and potentially infectious particles from them made it a high-risk location.<\/p>\n<img lazy-loadable=\"true\" data-runner-src"}

Thomas Fuhrmann via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA\n<h2>Bad for Animals, Bad for Humans<\/h2><p>When a virus infects a new species, it sometimes mutates, adapting to infect, replicate and transmit more efficiently in a new animal. This is called host adaptation. When a virus jumps to a new host and begins adapting, the results can be unpredictable.<\/p><p>In late 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into farmed mink in Denmark, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/don\/03-december-2020-mink-associated-sars-cov2-denmark\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it acquired mutations that were uncommon in humans<\/a>. Some of these mutations occurred in the part of the virus that most vaccines are designed to recognize. And it didn't just happen once \u2013 these mutations <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1126\/science.abe5901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">independently arose in mink farms multiple times<\/a>. While it's not yet clear what impact, if any, these mutations may have on human disease or the vaccine, these are signs of host adaptation that could allow novel variants of the virus to persist and reemerge from animal hosts in the future.<\/p><p>Another risk is that SARS-CoV-2 could cause disease in animals. Ecologists are especially concerned about endangered species like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaha.org\/publications\/newstat\/articles\/2020-12\/endangered-black-footed-ferret-gets-experimental-covid-19-vaccine-in-colorado\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">black-footed ferret<\/a>, which is closely related to minks and thought to be very susceptible to the virus.<\/p><p>Human-to-wildlife spillover has happened before.

More recently, a human respiratory virus has been <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10393-020-01506-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detected in threatened mountain gorilla populations<\/a> and has caused deaths as well.<\/p><p>But perhaps the biggest risk to humans is that spillover could result in the coronavirus establishing a reservoir in new animals and regions. This could provide opportunities for reintroduction of COVID-19 into humans in the future. This month researchers published a paper showing that this had already happened on a small scale with <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1126\/science.abe5901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">human\u2013to\u2013mink\u2013to\u2013human transmission on mink farms<\/a> in Denmark.<\/p><p>While our team has found no evidence of COVID-19 in wild animals in the U.S. at this time, we have seen convincing evidence of regular spillover into dogs and cats and some zoo animals.

NurPhoto \/ Contributor \/ Getty Images\nBy Peter Giger\nThe speed and scale of the response to COVID-19 by governments, businesses and individuals seems to provide hope that we can react to the climate change crisis in a similarly decisive manner - but history tells us that humans do not react to slow-moving and distant threats.\n<p>Our evolution has selected the \"fight or flight\" instinct to deal with environmental change, so rather like the metaphor of the frog in boiling water, we tend to react too little and too late to gradual change.<\/p><p>Climate change is often described as global warming, with the implication of gradual changes caused by a steady increase in temperatures; from heatwaves to melting glaciers.<\/p><p>But we know from multidisciplinary scientific evidence - from geology, anthropology and archaeology - that climate change is not incremental. Even in pre-human times, it is episodic, when it isn't forced by a human-induced acceleration of greenhouse gas emissions and warming.<\/p><p>There are parts of our planet's carbon cycle, the ways that the earth and the biosphere store and release carbon, that could trigger suddenly in response to gradual warming. These are tipping points that once passed could fundamentally disrupt the planet and produce abrupt, non-linear change in the climate.<\/p>\nA Game of Jenga\n<p>Think of it as a game of Jenga and the planet's climate system as the tower. For generations, we have been slowly removing blocks. But at some point, we will remove a pivotal block, such as the collapse of one of the major global ocean circulation systems, for example the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), that will cause all or part of the global climate system to fall into a planetary emergency.<\/p><p>But worse still, it could cause runaway damage: Where the tipping points form a domino-like cascade, where breaching one triggers breaches of others, creating an unstoppable shift to a radically and swiftly changing climate.<\/p><p>One of the most concerning tipping points is mass methane release. Methane can be found in deep freeze storage within permafrost and at the bottom of the deepest oceans in the form of methane hydrates. But rising sea and air temperatures are beginning to thaw these stores of methane.<\/p><p>This would release a powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, 30-times more potent than carbon dioxide as a global warming agent. This would drastically increase temperatures and rush us towards the breach of other tipping points.<\/p><p>This could include the acceleration of ice thaw on all three of the globe's large, land-based ice sheets \u2013 Greenland, West Antarctica and the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica. The potential collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is seen as a key tipping point, as its loss could eventually <a href=\"https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/324"}

Just look at the raised beaches around the world, at the last high stand of global sea level, at the end of the Pleistocene period around 120,0000 years ago, to see the evidence of such a warm world, which was just 2\u00b0C warmer than the present day.<\/p>\nCutting Off Circulation\n<p>As well as devastating low-lying and coastal areas around the world, melting polar ice could set off another tipping point: a disablement to the AMOC.<\/p><p>This circulation system drives a northward flow of warm, salty water on the upper layers of the ocean from the tropics to the northeast Atlantic region, and a southward flow of cold water deep in the ocean.<\/p><p>The ocean conveyor belt has a major effect on the climate, seasonal cycles and temperature in western and northern Europe. It means the region is warmer than other areas of similar latitude.<\/p><p>But melting ice from the Greenland ice sheet could threaten the AMOC system. It would dilute the salty sea water in the north Atlantic, making the water lighter and less able or unable to sink. This would slow the engine that drives this ocean circulation.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/atlantic-conveyor-belt-has-slowed-15-per-cent-since-mid-twentieth-century\" target=\"_blank\">Recent research<\/a> suggests the AMOC has already weakened by around 15% since the middle of the 20th century.

The initiative aided the Valley Ventures Accelerator program that focused on advancing water, energy and technology startups.\nIn the Fall of 2018, Valley Ventures began its 3rd cohort which included thirteen companies that gained access to mentorship experiences and engagement opportunities with top-tier industry leaders in agriculture and technology. One of the Cohort III companies was Skyven Technologies, a service-based energy company that is pioneering solutions for the food processing industry to reduce fuel use, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been an issue, not only in California, but across the United States with U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaling 5,215.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020. There is still much work to be done.\nSkyven was founded in 2013 by a team of problem-solvers with a vision to make a shift in climate change and a mission to decarbonize industrial process heat. By merging the core belief that decarbonization can be profitable with the science to back it up, the Skyven team created the company's first product, Intelligent Mirror Array (IMA) \u2013 a cutting-edge solar thermal collector, specialized to meet industrial heating demands. In the years since, the company has grown and achieved incredible success.\nIn January 2022, Skyven announced the closure of an oversubscribed $4M seed round led by VoLo Earth Ventures with participation from Global Founders Capital and the SWAN Impact Network. This brings the company's total capital intake in 2021 to $6.5M. This amazing win for the company opens up conversations about possibilities for the future.\n\"We know that to make progress on climate change, we have to align financial, operational, and environmental goals. To make that happen, we are pioneering an innovative tech-enabled business model where we only succeed if our customers succeed,\" said Arun Gupta, founder and CEO of Skyven Technologies, Inc. \"As we continue to see this vision through, we are grateful for our new partners and existing investors who are committed to building a resilient and equitable future.\"\nOver the years, the Water, Energy and Technology Center has celebrated the impressive growth of the ventures that have utilized our services.

Burnout can be defined as a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. As part of the startup community, it is easy - and often promoted - that entrepreneurs need to \"hustle\" and \"grind\" at 100 percent every day to turn rags into riches. Understanding the physical and mental effects of this lifestyle is important in order to take preventative measures or to get support when needed.\nThe entrepreneurial journey is not an easy one, and more often than not, founders may push themselves to the breaking point. \"All we need is the commitment to get enough sleep. Take time to recharge our mental and emotional batteries, put away our phones and laptops and tablets regularly, and try to introduce some stress-reduction tools into our lives,\" according to Arianna Huffington, Huffington Post founder.\nSee \"Six Tips for Avoiding Entrepreneurial Burnout\" for additional information.\nPartnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities \u2013 Building Markets and Investing in America's Climate-Smart Farmers, Ranchers & Forest Owners to Strengthen U.S. Rural and Agricultural Communities\nDeadline: April 8\nDeploying Solar with Wildlife and Ecosystem Services Benefits\nDeadline: April 11\nUS Department of Energy- Carbon Capture Research and Development\nNational Science Foundation-Signals in the Soil\nOrganic Transitions Program (ORG)\nCalifornia Energy Commission-PIER Natural Gas Program\nCheck out the California State Grants Portal for\nmore funding opportunities!\nHouse Critical and Emerging Technology List Updates\n7 Investors Every Water Technology Start-Up Should Know\nUSDA Announces American Rescue Plan Technical Assistance Investment to Benefit Underserved Farmers, Ranchers and Forest Landowners\nAmazon and U.S. Department of Energy team up to cut plastic waste\nPepsiCo"}

{"text":"206-312-1916 info@renovaexteriors.com\nPressure & Power Washer Cleaning\nMoss Removal & Treatment\nNow's the Best Time to Switch to Solar Energy \u2014 Here's Why\nEvery year, Americans are confronted with the reality of climate change. Scientists say it is accelerating fast, and that every effort to slow its progress now counts.\nCleaning solar panels in Seattle for a while now, we are well aware of the consequences of worsening climate change.\nSwitching to sustainable energy sources like solar panels is one way to combat this phenomenon. Of course, there has to be a collective effort for solar energy to have a significant impact on the fight against climate change.\nTo encourage more people to consider switching from grid electricity to solar power, here are four reasons that now's a good time to invest in solar panels.\nPeople Are Choosing to Live Off the Grid\nIn 2019, news outlets reported the rapid growth of green energy in the United States. Infrastructure to produce solar and wind energy was scheduled to be built starting in 2020, but unfortunately, those activities were halted temporarily due to the pandemic.\nSpeaking of the pandemic, one of the most valuable lessons it taught us is that going off the grid is possible and doable in this digital era. Households can stay connected and enjoy the perks of an electric-powered home even if they're disconnected from the electric grid. All they need is dependable, sustainable energy generators. This would have been difficult to do a decade ago, but now that solar panels have become more accessible and readily available, many are voluntarily switching to green energy.\nSolar Energy Systems Are Now More Affordable\nMoney is always a big issue where energy generation is concerned. Fortunately, the tech for solar panels and solar energy storage has progressed such that these systems can be scaled down and at the same time perform well enough to sustain a household's electrical needs. Coupled with the significant drop in the prices for solar energy hardware, the average homeowners can now afford to set up their own solar power generators at home.\nBy October 2020, solar became the cheapest electricity in the world. The technology for solar power became cheaper than renewable sources like gas and coal.\nThe New Administration Promotes Sustainable Energy\nThe Biden administration is determined to promote sustainable, green energy in the U.S. The goal is to make the country's electrical grid carbon-free by 2035. He also announced a nine-point energy plan that includes investing over $400 billion in innovation, research, and development for sustainable energy.\nWith the government's backing, we could be seeing widespread adoption of green energy sources, especially solar in the coming years.\nCalifornia Offers Tax Incentives to Solar Power Users\nThe state of Washington encourages people to invest in solar power by giving tax privileges to people who install solar panels at home or for their business. Examples of these incentives are:\nRenewable Energy System Incentive Program \u2013 Gives incentive payments to solar panel users for eight years or up to 50 percent of their system's cost, whichever comes first.\nIncentive program by the Washington State University\nThe Solarize Discount \u2013 A group purchase discount offer that can shave off 10-15 percent of the system's original price.\nRural Energy for America Program (REAP Grant) \u2013 Federal aid that can grant $500,000 or 25 percent of the total cost of installing solar panel systems in rural communities.\nInvestment Tax Credit (ITC) \u2013 A federal tax credit that can reduce the cost of photovoltaic solar systems by 26 percent.\nEnjoy the Perks of Solar Power to the Fullest\nInvesting in solar power for your home or business is a huge leap towards becoming sustainable and getting off the grid. Like any other equipment, however, solar power systems also need proper care and maintenance.\nOne of the most important maintenance routines for solar panels is keeping them clean and clear of debris. Proper safety equipment is necessary to ensure effective cleaning while eliminating the risk of injuries.\nYou can trust Renova Exterior Detailing to do this job well. There's more to our solar panel cleaning service than sweeping debris away from solar panels. We also inspect your solar power system and make sure that everything is in good working condition.\nGo solar and join the efforts to fight climate change.

{"text":"We are on the ground at COP26 to bring you the latest news, key announcements and proceedings from Glasgow, for what is being penned as our best and last chance to stop runaway climate change.\nDay 9 at COP26 is Transport day, which will advance discussions on how to reach zero-emission transport.\nUPDATE: 3:50pm GMT\nThe road to zero-emission vehicles\nAccelerating the ZEV Transition: A One Way Street, hosted by UNFCCC, was today's flagship event at COP26. Bringing together global and industry leaders to discuss the future of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the event began by highlighting the fact that air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide per year, underscoring the importance of efforts to decarbonise the transport sector.\nOther topics under discussion included the introduction of a COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero-emission cars and vans, which aims for all car sales to be zero-emission by 2035 in leading markets and by 2040 globally. The declaration includes a Memorandum of Understanding regarding Zero Emission Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, which aims to phase out emissions from such vehicles by 2040.\nThe event also highlighted the growth of the ZEV market in recent years. A total of 7.2% of all cars sold worldwide this year were electric, up from 2.6% in 2019, while national ZEV targets now cover 41% of the car market, compared with just 8% two years ago.\nC40 is also working to accelerate the transition to ZEVs. C40's Zero-Emission Vehicles Network brings together cities and key industry stakeholders to accelerate the implementation of zero-emission vehicle strategies.\nUPDATE: 12:20pm GMT\n\"We need to give everyone access to public transport if we're going to stop the climate crisis.\"\nIn a joint statement released today during COP26's Transport Day, a broad coalition called on national governments to collectively double public transport journeys in cities over the next decade, requiring USD $208 billion each year across C40 cities. As electric vehicles are the focus of the COP26 Transport Day, leaders warn public transport must not be forgotten if countries want to meet their climate targets.\nNew modelling conducted across five major global cities demonstrates that in addition to supporting the sustainable growth of urban economies, the right investment would create 4.6 million new jobs in C40 cities specifically. Each city would gain tens of thousands of jobs between 2021 and 2030 and put them on a pathway to meet climate goals aligned with the Paris Agreement.

It also has slightly more female representation, as also Rajya Sabha presence, and is just a wee bit younger.\nOf course, the BJP dominates the new council much more than Congress did UPA-2, but that's hardly surprising given the fact that BJP has a Lok Sabha majority on its own whereas Congress had just over 200 seats in the 543-member House\n1 List of ministers in PM Narendra Modi's government\n2 As in May 2014\n2.1 Prime Minister\n2.2 Cabinet ministers\n2.3 Ministers of state (independent charge)\n2.4 Ministers of state\n3 As in November 2014\n4 May 2014: Background check: wealth, criminal record\n5 Nov 2014: Curriculum vitae of the new ministers\n6 July 2016: council of ministers\n6.1 Gainers, losers, reshuffled\n6.2 State's representation in Ministry\n7 2017, Sept: new council of ministers\n7.4 Gainers, losers, new entrants\n7.6 Track records of Pradhan, Piyush: 2014-17\n7.7 Ex-armymen, civil servants in the cabinet\n8 2013-15: Expenditure on Prime Minister and cabinet\n9.1 Smriti removed from I&B\nList of ministers in PM Narendra Modi's government\nChart: The Times of India\nThe Union Cabinet of India as in Nov 2014.

Four ministers were allotted cabinet rank, whereas three took charge as Ministers of State (independent charge). The remaining 14 took oath as MoS.\nThe expansion takes the number of ministers in the Modi cabinet to 66.\nHere is the list of newly sworn-in ministers and all that you need to know about them:\nManohar Parrikar, 58: The former Goa chief minister took oath as a cabinet minister on Sunday. A metallurgical engineering graduate from IIT-Bombay, he has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase. He is tipped to be the defence minister.\nSuresh Prabhu, 61: He was the chemical and fertilizer minister in the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Prabhu, who later became the environment minister during NDA, is known as a performer. A former Shiv Sena member, he is part of international bodies on sustainable growth and climate change. A law degree holder with doctorate in climate change from Germany, Prabhu is a strong votary of a balance between economic development and environment protection. His website says he has \"uncommon whiff of much needed fresh air\" who introduced amendment to the Patents Act that gave fillip to the Indian generic medicine industry.\nJagat Prakash Nadda, 54: Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. The veteran politician who earned recognition as a Himachal Pradesh leader, lost the race for BJP's presidency to Amit Shah after the Lok Sabha elections. His big leap into politics started during Emergency in 1977 as Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad secretary. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims himself to be a disciplined solider of the R S S.\nBirendra Singh, 68: A long-time Congress man, he joined the BJP before assembly elections in Haryana this August to protest against the grand old party not agreeing to sacking of then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. In his long political career, he had been Congress in-charge for many states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal, and was the chairperson of many parliamentary standing committees. He had joined the BJP apparently on the assurance that he would get a Union cabinet berth.\nBandaru Dattatreya, 67: A minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, he was president of the BJP in newly created state of Telangana. An R S S activist, he was the founding member of the party in residual Andhra Pradesh and was chairperson of several parliamentary standing committees. He had been elected to the Lower House for the first time from Secunderabad in the 10th Lok Sabha.\nRajiv Pratap Rudy, 52: At an age of 38, he was inducted as one of the youngest ministers in the Vajpayee government in 2000. He was a minister of state and elevated with independent charge three years later and given the important portfolio of civil aviation. Alumni of Punjab University and MP from Bihar, he was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the largest single party in the recently concluded assembly elections.\nDr Mahesh Sharma, 55: A doctor by profession, Sharma is an MP from"}
{"text":" Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida. He runs several charitable hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Territory. Sharma has been a long associate of the R S S and is former Noida MLA from the BJP.\nHansraj Ahir, 59: He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. It was on his letter to the Central Vigilance Commission that led to a CBI inquiry into the coal scam. He was face of the BJP in exposing the coal scam during the UPA regime and obtained relevant documents to embarrass the Manmohan Singh led government. An active Parliamentarian, Ahir had introduced a large number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.\nMukhtar Abbas Naqvi, 57: A vocal BJP spokesperson and former minister of state for information and broadcasting, Naqvi had been the Muslim face of the party for long. Born in 1957 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, Naqvi contested his first election on now-defunct Janata Party ticket in 1980 and was one of the ministers in Vajpayee's cabinet in 1998. Known for freely airing his views, he created a flutter by saying that now even Dawood Ibrahim can join the BJP on decision to induct Bihar Janata Dal (United) leader Shabbir Ali during 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\nGiriraj Singh, 54: His emergence on the national political scene had been rather dramatic. During Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission debarred him from campaigning after he asked all Modi detractors to go to Pakistan. And after the polls he was in the news for about Rs. 1.14 crore stolen from his house in Patna. A firebrand Bhumihar leader from Bihar was a minister in Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government, and influences vast pockets in southern Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015, and election-bound Jharkhand.\nRam Kripal Yadav, 57: A former Lalu Prasad supporter, he quit the party after being denied a ticket from Pataliputra. He contested on a BJP ticket and defeated Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti. A former deputy mayor of Patna and a law graduate, Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both the houses of Parliament, where he had represented Prasad's RJD. An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP's campaign to form the next government in the state in 2015 assembly elections.\nBabul Supriyo, 44: It was on a flight with Baba Ramdev as co-passenger that singer Babul Supriyo's political baptism took place. Ramdev reportedly asked Supriyo if he was interested in politics and contesting an election. The stocky singer's induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo's thumping victory from Asansol on a BJP ticket was a huge boost for the party. Born and raised in Uttarpara, he is the musical heir to a prestigious musical family of West Bengal and the grandson of the noted composer, Banikantha NC Baral.\nJayant Sinha 51: The 51-year-old Hazaribagh MP, Jayant Sinha, is a former corporate honcho with wide experience in corporate governance and strategy consulting. He will be an asset in an economic ministry. Son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, he spent 12 years with McKinsey & Company as a partner apart from serving as president of Internet Business Capital Corp and in consulting positions at Stone & Webster and Synergic Resources Corporation, US. Sinha is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.\nSanwar Lal Jat, 59: Sanwar Lal Jat had defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. Jat is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje Cabinet to contest the elections.\nMohan Kundariya: He is an influential leader from Patel community and MP from Rajkot. Powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.\nRam Shankar, 50: A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academician by profession and had been part of the party's anti-corruption campaign.

{"text":". A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur in Punjab and inducted into the cabinet for the first time.\nYS Chowdhary, 53: It has been a meteoric rise for the TDP leader. A businessman from Hyderabad, he was unanimously elected to Rajya Sabha in 2010. His brief bio-data on the Rajya Sabha website says he is an engineer by profession but was hand-picked for the election to upper house by TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.\nHaribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, 60: He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been the BJP member since 1988, and had been the vice-president of Gujarat state unit from 2005 to 2010.\nSadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, 47: The lone women [new] induction in the Modi cabinet, Jyoti is an MP from Fatepur who defeated RLD's Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life and well-known R S S leanings.\nJuly 2016: council of ministers\nGainers, losers, reshuffled\nRahul Kanwal, Maximum Government \"India Today\" 18\/7\/2016\nSee graphic\nMajor changes \"India Today\" 18\/7\/2016\nState's representation in Ministry\nRahul Kanwal, Maximium Government \"India Today\" 18\/7\/2016\nMinisterial stakes \"India Today\" 18\/7\/2016\n2017, Sept: new council of ministers\nRaj Nath Singh: Minister of Home Affairs.\nSushma Swaraj: Minister of External Affairs.\nArun Jaitley: Minister of Finance; and Minister of Corporate Affairs.\nNitin Jairam Gadkari: Minister of Road Transport and Highways; Minister of Shipping Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.\nSuresh Prabhu: Minister of Commerce and Industry.\nDV Sadananda Gowda: Minister of Statistics and Programme Implementation.\nUma Bharati: Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation.\nRamvilas Paswan: Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.\nManeka Sanjay Gandhi: Minister of Women and Child Development.\nAnanthkumar: Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers; and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs.\nRavi Shankar Prasad: Minister of Law and Justice & Minister of Electronics and Information Technology.\nJagat Prakash Nadda: Minister of Health and Family Welfare.\nAshok Gajapathi Raju Pusapati: Minister of Civil Aviation.\nAnant Geete: Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises.\nSmt.

The actual expenditure is reflected in the finance accounts tabled in Parliament towards the end of the winter session. But more significant has been the savings on account of salaries and allowances of Modi's ministers. The reduction in salary bills and allowances of ministers during FY15 has been between 17%-24%. As against the salary bill of Rs 4.40 crore for Cabinet ministers and MoS in the RE, the actuals are at Rs 3.63 crore. Similarly, the actual expenditure on allowances to ministers has come down from Rs 9.50 crore (as projected in the RE) to Rs 7.20 crore during the first year.\nThe explanation given by the government in the Appropriation Accounts says the cut in the overall salary, allowances and tour bills have been possible due to"}
{"text":" \"reduction in the strength of Cabinet... less foreign tours undertaken and economy measures\".\nThe travel bill of Modi government in its inaugural year is still about Rs 56 crore more than the Rs 258 crore the UPA-II Cabinet had spent in its last year in office (2013-14).\nAt Rs 10.83 crore, the salary and allowances bills of the 65-member Modi's council of l ministers have been brought e down by at least Rs 3 crore e from projected Rs 13.90 crore n in the RE, which was at the. same level as that of the 75 member UPA\nSmriti removed from I&B\nSmriti removed from I&B, Goyal's FM till Jaitley's back, May 15, 2018: The Times of India\nRathore To Hold Independent Charge Of I&B\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi temporarily assigned charge of the ministries of finance and corporate affairs to railway minister Piyush Goyal till Arun Jaitley recovers from a kidney transplant, while removing the controversyscarred Smriti Irani from the high-profile I&B ministry.\nSmriti's loss will be sports minister Rajyavardhan Rathore's gain. The Olympic medallist, who was closely engaged with the Indian squad which participated in the Commonwealth Games and also served as junior minister in I&B, will now hold fullscale charge of the ministry.\nIrani's remit has now shrunk to the textiles ministry in what is being seen as a second setback for the young politician who had earlier lost the crucial HRD ministry.\nThe fresh demotion comes in the wake of a string of contentious measures by the I&B ministry during her tenure. There had been speculation about her departure since the PMO, in an unusual public rebuke, ordered the reversal of the ministry's controversial guidelines purportedly meant to tackle \"fake news\". Sources close to Irani had insisted that the guidelines were never issued and blamed the fiasco on bureaucrats, but her removal suggests that the PMO thought otherwise.\nThe odds appeared to have lengthened further against her after her recent run-in with Rashtrapati Bhavan over the handling of the national film awards function.\nModi signals continued support to Goyal\nThe recent controversy over the national film awards function saw the President's office conveying its unhappiness to the PMO, tipping the scales against Irani, who also took on Prasar Bharti and officers belonging to the Indian Information Service.\nInterestingly, Rathore will be the Modi government's fifth I&B minister in four years. Irani's tenure lasted less than a year.\nIn stunning contrast, the new responsibility marks yet another boost for Goyal. With the addition, although temporary, of the responsibilities of finance and corporate affairs, he will have a sprawling jurisdiction along with railways and coal. In his new role as finance minister, Goyal will join the Cabinet Committee on Security, an important club which consists of the Prime Minister and the ministers of home, external affairs and defence.\nJaitley, who successfully underwent a kidney transplant, will be a \"minister without portfolio until he recovers\". Top sources in the government emphasised that Goyal has been given charge of finance and corporate affairs as a stop-gap arrangement until the time Jaitley recovers.\nIn a late evening communique, Rashtrapati Bhavan also said that SS Ahluwalia would be the junior minister for electronics and information technology instead of KJ Alphons, the MoS (independent charge) for tourism.\nGoyal, the BJP treasurer and a chartered accountant by training, has been given charge of the crucial finance ministry when has to iron out wrinkles in the implementation of goods and services tax (GST) and put the banking sector, grappling with a series of loan frauds and bad debt, back on track.\nThe finance ministry will also have to keep a close watch on revving up economic growth and keeping public finances under control against the backdrop of rising global crude oil prices.\nAlthough Jaitley was attending to official work despite his ill health, the surgery at AIIMS on Monday will put him out of action for at least a couple of months, prompting to the PM to give the additional charge of the ministry to a person well versed with the nuances of the economy.\nIt also signals Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continued support for Goyal who was facing allegations related to the non-disclosure of the sale of his company to the Piramal Group, a charge that the minister has strongly rebutted.\nInterestingly, unlike Irani who got the cabinet rank on her debut in May 2014, Goyal had to persevere as minister of state for coal and power before being promoted in September 2017.\nUnion Cabinets\/ Council of Ministers, India (historical)\nRetrieved from 'http:\/\/indpaedia.com\/ind\/index.php?title=Union_Cabinet\/_Council_of_Min"}
{"text":"WALL, N.J.\u2013(BUSINESS WIRE)\u2013New Jersey Resources (NYSE:NJR) today reported net financial earnings (NFE) of $151.5 million, or $1.78 per share, for fiscal 2015 and announced NFE guidance for fiscal 2016.\nA reconciliation of net income to NFE for the fourth quarter and fiscal years 2015 and 2014 is provided below.\nFor fiscal 2015, NJR reported NFE of $151.5 million, or $1.78 per share, compared with $176.9 million, or $2.10 per share, in fiscal 2014. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the company's net financial loss was $5.2 million, compared with a net financial loss of $19.4 million in the same period last year.\n\"Fiscal 2015 was another exemplary year, led by continued customer growth at NJR's regulated utility, New Jersey Natural Gas, and much better-than expected results for the second year in a row at NJR Energy Services, the company's wholesale provider of physical natural gas services. NJR Energy Services' results, in excess of our expectations over the last two years, have contributed $94 million of NFE to support future growth,\" said Laurence M. Downes, chairman and CEO of New Jersey Resources.\nAdditionally, increased capital investments at NJR Clean Energy Ventures (NJRCEV), NJR's non-regulated distributed power subsidiary, and improved results at NJR's regulated natural gas midstream segment, NJR Midstream, helped drive financial results.\nSubject to the risks and uncertainties identified below under \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" NJR expects fiscal 2016 NFE to be in a range of $1.55 to $1.65 per basic share.\nNJR's average annual long-term NFE-per-share growth rate goal is 5 to 9 percent with fiscal 2013 as the base year. In addition, the company's annual dividend growth rate goal is 6 to 8 percent and its long-term payout ratio goal is 60 to 65 percent.\nOn September 1, 2015, our NJR board of directors unanimously approved a 6.7 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $.24 per share from $.225 per share effective October 1, 2015. The new annual dividend rate is $.96 per share. NJR has increased its dividend rate 22 times since 1995. On November 11, 2015, the board of directors unanimously declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.24 per share payable on January 4, 2016 to shareowners of record on December 15, 2015. The company has paid quarterly dividends continuously since its inception in 1952.\nOn a split-adjusted basis, NJR repurchased 348,200 shares of common stock under its share repurchase plan during fiscal 2015. The plan authorizes NJR to purchase its shares on the open market, or in negotiated transactions, based on market and other financial conditions. Since the plan's inception in September 1996, NJR has repurchased 16.8 million shares at an average price of $16.05 per share. Approximately 2.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the NJR share repurchase plan.\nFiscal 2015 NFE at NJNG were $76.3 million, compared with $74.2 million in fiscal 2014. Results were driven primarily by higher utility gross margin from customer additions, Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) incentive programs and regulatory initiatives, such as The SAVEGREEN Project\u00ae. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, NJNG reported a net financial loss of $7.7 million, compared with a net financial loss of $5.4 million in the same period last year. The increased loss in the quarter was primarily due to an increase in the overall state tax rate at NJNG.\nIn fiscal 2015, NJNG added 7,858 new customers, compared with 7,599 in fiscal 2014, an increase of 3.4 percent. Of these customers, 3,966 were related to new construction, compared with 3,695 in the same period last year, a 7.3 percent increase. In fiscal 2015, total new and existing customer conversions were 4,528. These new and conversion customers, in addition to those commercial customers that switched from interruptible to firm natural gas service, will contribute approximately $4.5 million annually to utility gross margin, a 2.8 percent increase over the same period last year.\nNJNG projects customer additions for fiscal 2016 through 2018 of 24,000 to 27,000, representing a new customer growth rate of about 1.6 percent. For more information on utility gross margin, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" below.\nIn fiscal 2015, The SAVEGREEN Project, NJNG's energy-efficiency program, invested nearly $26 million in grants, incentives and the On-Bill Repayment Program (OBRP) to help make investing in high-efficiency natural gas"}
{"text":" equipment and energy-efficient upgrades more affordable for NJNG customers. The SAVEGREEN team performed 4,407 home energy audits to identify additional energy-efficiency opportunities, with an emphasis on whole-house improvements to further increase energy savings for customers. In addition, 1,977 NJNG customers took advantage of the OBRP in fiscal 2015.\nSince its inception in 2009, SAVEGREEN grants, incentives and OBRP loans, totaling over $117.5 million, have helped more than 38,900 customers reduce energy consumption and lower their energy bills. This directly supports the state's environmental goals and its mandate to reduce energy costs for residents.\nIn total, NJNG has the approval to invest approximately $219.3 million in SAVEGREEN grants, financial incentives and the OBRP over the life of the program, which is in place through July 31, 2017. Currently, the company is authorized to earn an overall return on its SAVEGREEN investments, ranging from 6.69 to 7.76 percent, with a return on equity (ROE) ranging from 9.75 to 10.3 percent. The recovery period varies from two to 10 years, depending on the type of energy-efficiency investment.\nIn fiscal 2015, NJNG invested $32.8 million in its Safety Acceleration and Facilities Enhancement (SAFE) program, a planned $130 million, four-year infrastructure investment. Through SAFE, NJNG will replace 276 miles of its distribution main to further ensure the safety, reliability and resiliency of its natural gas delivery system. This will include the replacement of all of NJNG's cast iron main and approximately 50 percent of its unprotected bare steel distribution main, along with the associated services. To date, NJNG has replaced approximately 220 miles of distribution main through the SAFE program. NJNG expects to complete the cast iron main replacement by the end of first-quarter fiscal 2016. SAFE investments will earn a weighted average cost of capital of 6.9 percent, including a 9.75 percent ROE.\nIn addition, NJNG invested $7.4 million in fiscal 2015 in its Reinvestment in System Enhancement (NJ RISE) program, a five-year, $102.5 million investment in six capital projects, designed to improve NJNG's service disruption response and strengthen the overall safety, reliability and integrity of its natural gas distribution and transmission systems. These system enhancements are designed to help diminish the impact of future major weather events and align directly with the state's directive for improved energy resiliency and preparedness.\nNJ RISE investments through July 31, 2015 were included in a May 2015 filing before the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), with proposed recovery through an adjustment to base rates. On October 15, 2015, the BPU approved the base rate increase for NJNG to recover $3.2 million of capital investments, effective November 1, 2015. These investments will earn a weighted average cost of capital of 6.74 percent, including a 9.75 percent ROE. Cost recovery for NJ RISE investments after July 31, 2015, as well as SAFE investments, are addressed in NJNG's base rate case petition filed on November 13, 2015. Please see the \"Rate Case Filing\" segment below.\nConstruction continues on NJNG's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in Howell, New Jersey. This approximately $28 million investment will enable the company to liquefy pipeline natural gas for peak-day use, ensure system integrity and reliability and reduce LNG transportation and capacity costs. In addition, this project will benefit customers by potentially lowering BGSS costs, help the environment by reducing emissions related to the transportation of LNG and create additional value for shareowners. NJNG expects the site to be operational in spring 2016.\nThe Southern Reliability Link (SRL) project, a 30-mile, 30-inch transmission main to support system reliability and resiliency, representing an estimated investment of between $175 million to $180 million, continues to move forward. On June 5, 2015, NJNG filed amended petitions with the BPU seeking (1) approval to construct and operate and (2) a determination that the SRL is reasonably necessary for the service, convenience and welfare of the public, as well as to find that certain ordinances, permits and regulations have no application to the project.\nOn October 27, 2015, NJNG announced it will provide BGSS bill credits totaling $76 million to its residential and small commercial customers. The bill credits will be issued beginning November 1, 2015 through February 29, 2016. A typical residential heating customer using 100 therms a month will save approximately $166, or 17 percent, on their annual bill. Since October 2008, typical residential heating customer bills have decreased over 42 percent.\nNJNG's BGSS filing represents the commodity charge passed through to customers based on the company's cost to acquire natural gas. Any change in the BGSS rates does not represent a change in NJNG's gross"}
{"text":" margin.\nOn November 13, 2015, NJNG filed a request with the BPU seeking an increase of approximately $148 million to its delivery rates. The petition is requesting the recovery of capital investments related to NJNG's infrastructure investments and current operating costs. This proposed rate adjustment will help NJNG recover these costs to continue providing its customers with safe, reliable, resilient service. If approved, it would result in an overall increase of approximately 24 percent on the typical customer's annual bill.\nFrom 2008 through 2015, NJNG has invested approximately $806 million in its natural gas transmission and distribution system. This includes expenditures for customer growth, as well as system improvements, reinforcements, replacements and retirements. The timing of this filing is driven by this substantial capital investment in infrastructure over the past seven years, as well as the company's agreement to file a base rate case no later than November 15, 2015 in accordance with the BPU's Order in the matter for approval of the SAFE and NJ RISE programs.\nNJNG has not filed a general request to increase delivery rates since 2007. Over that time, the company has worked hard to manage its business efficiently and effectively, employing capital and cost-control strategies that have helped avoid the need to file for a change to its delivery rates.\nUnder normal conditions, the BPU's review could take up to 10 months.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, NJNG announced the opening of the first two public access compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling stations in its service territory located at the Waste Management, Inc. facility in Toms River, Ocean County and Shore Point Distributing Company, Inc., in Freehold, Monmouth County. A third CNG station at the Middletown Township Department of Public Works in Monmouth County is currently under construction. NJNG expects it to be operational in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\n\"New Jersey Natural Gas is proud to work with Waste Management and Shore Point Distributing to provide New Jersey residents and businesses with 24\/7 access to cleaner, cost-effective fuel options. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) are a proven, energy-efficient alternative to gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles and today's abundant supply of natural gas provides cost advantages for its use as a transportation fuel. This additional fueling access will help stimulate the market for NGVs in alignment with the state's public policy goal,\" continued Downes.\nThe construction of these three CNG fueling stations are part of NJNG's unique pilot program, the NGV Advantage. With approval from the BPU, NJNG invested approximately $10 million to build, own and maintain the infrastructure for the three CNG fueling stations. The host companies will be required to initially use at least 20 percent of the refueling capacity and open the stations to the public on a 24\/7 basis.\nNJNG is authorized by the BPU to earn an overall return of 7.1 percent, including a 10.3 percent ROE on these investments.\nIn fiscal 2015, NJNG's gross margin-sharing BGSS incentive programs, which include off-system sales, capacity release, storage optimization and financial risk management programs, contributed $17.7 million to utility gross margin, compared with $16 million in fiscal 2014. The improved results were due primarily to an increase in value for pipeline capacity that was available for release. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, these incentives contributed $4.6 million to utility gross margin, compared with $5.6 million in the same period last year. The decrease was due primarily to a change in the storage incentive benchmark calculation.\nNJNG shares the gross margin earned from these incentive programs with customers and shareowners, according to a gross margin-sharing formula authorized by the BPU. On October 15, 2015, the BPU approved the continuation of NJNG's incentive programs with slight modifications. The financial risk management incentive was terminated as of November 1, 2015 and the storage incentive benchmark calculation was updated to reflect current transportation and fuel costs. Since inception in 1992, these incentive programs have saved customers over $800 million and provided shareowners with $1.25 per share in NFE, which is an average of $.05 per share annually.\nFiscal 2015 NFE at NJRES were $42.1 million, compared with $79.7 million in fiscal 2014. The reduction in NFE is attributable primarily to extraordinary results in fiscal 2014 that were driven by greater market volatility across the United States, which did not recur to the same magnitude in fiscal 2015. However, fiscal 2015 NFE were the third highest in NJRES' history, resulting from better-than-expected volatility in the marketplace.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, NJRES reported a net financial loss of $5.4 million, compared with a net financial loss of $10.4 million in the same period last year. These improved results are due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and the statutory state income tax rate due to"}
{"text":" changes in state apportionment factors.\n\"For the second consecutive year, our NJRES team identified key growth opportunities in ever-changing market conditions, achieving much better-than-anticipated results and providing additional value for our shareowners,\" said Downes.\nNJRES has a portfolio of storage and pipeline capacity assets that complement the changing dynamics in the natural gas industry and position the company to serve the growing market for physical natural gas services, including producer services. NJRES' asset portfolio currently consists of approximately 40 Bcf of firm storage contracts and 1.5 Bcf\/day of firm transportation contracts.\nFiscal 2015 NFE at NJRCEV were $20.1 million, compared with $12.7 million in fiscal 2014. The higher results were due primarily to increased investment tax credits (ITCs) from solar capital investments, increased Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) revenue and returns on its first two onshore wind investments.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, NJRCEV reported NFE of $1.9 million, compared with a net financial loss of $7.6 million in the same period last year. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, NJRCEV had a minority equity interest in Own Energy, Inc., an onshore wind developer which provided NJRCEV with the option to acquire wind farms that fit its investment profile. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Own Energy was acquired by a power producer and NJRCEV realized a $3 million pre-tax gain in exchange for its ownership interest.\nDuring fiscal 2015, NJRCEV placed into service $68.8 million of ground-mounted commercial solar systems in New Jersey, totaling 26.5 megawatts (MW), growing its commercial solar portfolio to over 82 MW. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, NJRCEV placed into service a $15.5 million, 6 MW ground-mounted, grid-connected system in North Hanover, New Jersey. These capital investments support the state's environmental and renewable energy goals, and its mandate to reduce energy costs in New Jersey.\nIn fiscal 2015, NJRCEV invested $25 million in The Sunlight Advantage\u00ae, the company's residential solar lease program, adding 829 customers and growing its residential solar portfolio to over 35 MW. In October, the company reached a milestone, adding its 4,000th customer to the program. The Sunlight Advantage provides savings to eligible homeowners through both roof- and ground-mounted solar systems with no upfront installation or maintenance costs.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2015, NJRCEV's wind portfolio had grown to nearly 30 MW. Currently, construction continues on the company's third onshore wind project, the Alexander Wind Farm, located in Rush County, Kansas, approximately 120 miles northwest of Wichita. NJRCEV will invest approximately $85 million to construct, own and operate the wind farm with a total capacity of 48.3 MW. Energy and renewable attributes produced at the Alexander Wind Farm will be sold under two long-term agreements. The Kansas City Board of Public Utilities has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for approximately 50 percent of the energy. Yahoo! Inc., the global Internet corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, has signed a 15-year agreement for the additional 50 percent to offset much of its energy usage in the Great Plains region. NJRCEV expects the Alexander Wind Farm to also qualify for federal production tax credits (PTCs), which will be utilized by NJR. NJRCEV expects this project to be placed in service in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nOver the next three years, NJRCEV expects a declining percentage of its NFE to come from ITCs associated with solar investments. Looking out through fiscal 2018, the company anticipates that it will benefit from higher SREC revenue and a diversified distributed power portfolio of small- to mid-sized onshore wind projects, supported by long-term PPAs and financial hedges, thereby reducing its reliance on ITCs.\nNJR Midstream reported fiscal 2015 NFE of $9.8 million, compared with $7.5 million in fiscal 2014. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, NFE was $2.6 million, compared with $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The increases were due to higher revenue associated with firm services at both Steckman Ridge and Iroquois Pipeline.\nNJR's midstream segment, NJR Midstream, consists of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated capital investments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, NJR Midstream diversified its portfolio through an exchange of its 5.53 percent equity ownership in the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, LP (IGTS) for 1.8 million common units in Dominion Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: DM), a master limited partnership. The exchange generated a pre-tax gain of $24."}

NJR Midstream also includes a 50 percent equity ownership in Steckman Ridge, a 12 Bcf natural gas storage facility in southwestern Pennsylvania jointly owned with Spectra Energy.\nIn fiscal 2014, NJR announced its participation in the PennEast Pipeline and currently has a 20 percent ownership interest in the project. This 118-mile pipeline is designed to bring lower cost natural gas produced in the Marcellus Shale region to homes and businesses in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and provide greater system reliability for local utilities. PennEast filed a formal application with FERC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and currently estimates an in-service date of fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2015, NFE at NJR Home Services (NJRHS), the company's unregulated retail and appliance service subsidiary, were $2.4 million, compared with $2.5 million in fiscal 2014. NJRHS generated NFE of $2.7 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $2.3 million in the same period last year.

{"text":"Stagnant Supercivilizations and Interstellar Travel\nby Paul Gilster on July 28, 2017\nJust how long can a civilization live? It's a key question, showing up as a factor in the Drake Equation and possibly explaining our lack of success at finding evidence for ETI. But as Andrei Kardashev believed, it is possible that civilizations can live for aeons, curbed only by the resources available to them, opening up the question of how they evolve. In today's essay, Nick Nielsen looks at long-lived societies, asking whether they would tend toward stasis \u2014 Clarke's The City and the Stars comes to mind \u2014 and how the capability of interstellar flight plays into their choices for growth. Would we be aware of them if they were out there? Have a look at supercivilizations, their possible trajectories of development, and consider what such interstellar stagnation might look like to a young and questing species searching for answers.\nby J. N. Nielsen\nWhat are stagnant supercivilizations?\nAs far as I know there are no precise definitions of supercivilizations, but this should not surprise us as there are no precise definitions of civilization simpliciter. In his paper, \"On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations\" (1985), Nikolai S. Kardashev explicitly formulated two assumptions regarding supercivilizations:\n\"I. The scales of activity of any civilization are restricted only by natural and scientific factors. This assertion implies that all processes observed in Nature (from phenomena in the microcosmos to those in the macrocosmos and all the way to the whole Universe) may in time be utilized by civilizations, be reproduced or even somewhat changed, though of course always in accordance with the laws of Nature.\n\"II. Civilizations have no inner, inherent limitations on the scales of their activities. This implies that presumptions of a possible self destruction of a civilization, or of a certain restrictions on the level of its development are not factual. Actually social conflicts may in fact be resolved, while civilizations will always face problems that demand larger scales of activity.\" [1]\nIf Kardashev was right, there being only natural and scientific restrictions on the scale of the activity of civilization, and the absence of inherent limitations on civilizations, would mean that an expanding civilization would just keep expanding, subject only to natural laws like those of general relativity and quantum theory, thermodynamics and conservation laws. Presumably, then, older expanding civilizations would eventually become supercivilizations in virtue of the scale of their activities, which would grow proportionally (or perhaps exponentially) to their age. Here we see the relationship between supercivilizations and the recurrent motif of million-year-old or even billion-year-old civilizations. But once grown to these dimensions, what then?\nIn a series of posts \u2014 Stagnant Supercivilizations, An Alternative Formulation of Stagnant Supercivilizations, Suboptimal Civilizations, Supercivilizations and Superstagnation, and What Do Stagnant Supercivilizations Do During Their Million Year Lifespans? \u2014 I discussed Kardashevian supercivilizations that have become stagnant\u2014in other words, civilizations that are very old, very large, very powerful, and very advanced, but which have attained a plateau of achievement and thus have ceased to develop. Such civilizations, in a growth phase, may have taken advantage of the absence of any inherent limitation upon the scale of their activities and would have grown to utilize all the processes of nature, subject only to the laws of nature. Their growth trajectory would have described an S-curve, much like a species that converges upon the carrying capacity of its ecosystem. Having reached an equilibrium with its environment\u2014which, in the case of a supercivilization, is the cosmos itself\u2014the growth of a supercivilization would then be limited by galactic ecology. [2]\nThis seems to contradict Kardashev's second assumption, that, \"Civilizations have no inner, inherent limitations on the scales of their activities,\" but the carrying capacity of the cosmos would constitute an extrinsic or exogenous limitation on the scales of a supercivilization's activities, rather than an intrinsic or endogenous limitation. Moreover, this extrinsic limitation, which, once encountered, entails stagnation, is consistent with Kardashev's first assumption, that a supercivilization's activities must be, \"in accordance with the laws of Nature\" and are restricted by natural factors. The carrying capacity of the cosmos is the natural restriction upon the growth of supercivilizations.\nIf a galaxy is the ecosystem in which a supercivilization comes to maturity, then the carrying capacity of a galaxy will determine the growth and eventual stagnation of supercivilizations once carrying capacity is reached, with that carrying capacity being determined by the accessibility of available matter and usable energy at the disposal of a supercivilization. This ecological limit to the growth of supercivilizations would constitute, \"natural and scientific factors,\" that would restrict"}
{"text":" a supercivilization's scale of activity, constituting a confirmation of Kardashev's principles, and would, additionally, make the metaphor of galactic ecology literally true.\nThis is but one possible scenario for the stagnation of a supercivilization. Sagan and Newman suggested a scenario of supercivilization stagnation based upon the intelligent progenitor species of a civilization transcending their biological limitations and becoming effectively immortal:\n\"A society of immortals must practice more stringent population control than a society of mortals. In addition, whatever its other charms, interstellar spaceflight must pose more serious hazards than residence on the home planet. To the extent that such predispositions are inherited, natural selection would tend in such a world to eliminate those individuals lacking a deep passion for the longest possible lifespans, assuming no initial differential replication.\" [3]\nAccording to Sagan and Newman the result of this would be:\n\"\u2026a civilization with a profound commitment to stasis even on rather long cosmic time scales and a predisposition antithetical to interstellar colonization.\" [4]\nI could criticize this scenario on several grounds, but my purpose here is not to engage with the argument, but to present it for exhibition as one among multiple possible sources of stagnation for advanced civilizations. The point is that even the largest, oldest, most advanced civilizations are subject to stagnation\u2014perhaps especially subject to stagnation.\n[We could pursue terraforming within our own planetary system even without interstellar travel.]\nAre there hard limits to interstellar travel?\nIn the argument that I unfolded in What Do Stagnant Supercivilizations Do During Their Million Year Lifespans? so as to concede a point to potential critics before this was used as a cudgel against my argument, I tried to show how, even without interstellar travel, a supercivilization could provide for itself civilizational-scale stimulation. My argument was that even a supercivilization confined to its home planetary system could engage in terraforming (or its non-terrestrial equivalent) and even world-building, and so might be able to observe the development of life over biological scales of time and the development of intelligence and civilization over their respective scales of time.\nMy assumption in making this argument was that a civilization in a position to make scientific observations of phenomena as fundamental as the origins of life, intelligence, and civilization, eventually would formulate a vast body of scientific knowledge based on these scientific observations. All of this was mere prelude in order to ask the question that was bothering me at the time: could a supercivilization remain stagnant when it was in a position to assimilate a vast body of scientific knowledge? It seems unlikely to me that a civilization that had grown to supercivilization status in virtue of its mastery of science and technology could remain unaffected by an influx of scientific knowledge.\nAs I noted above, I sought to demonstrate the possibility of civilizational-scale intellectual stimulation without recourse to interstellar space travel in order to focus on what is still possible to a very old civilization even under hard limits to space travel. If such a civilization also possessed technology sufficient for interstellar travel, then the possibilities for stimulation would be all the greater, and my argument would be strengthened, so that considering the narrower question of a supercivilization stranded within its home planetary system constituted a more rigorous test of the idea of civilizational-scale scientific stimulation.\nWe all know that, even among scientists, even among advocates of space travel, there are those who insist upon hard limits to interstellar travel. Hence the need to make an argument without an appeal to interstellar travel. This insistence upon hard limits to interstellar travel is not my position, but I do want to try to understand the reasoning and the motivations that have led otherwise intelligent individuals to declare interstellar travel to be not merely difficult, but an insuperable impossibility (or so difficult as to be impossible for all practical purposes). What, then, are the reasons given for the impossibility or impracticality of interstellar travel? I will consider this question by way of a digression discussing the idea of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and what I call the SETI paradigm.\n[The SETI paradigm incorporates assumptions about the likelihood of interstellar travel.]\nWhat is the SETI Paradigm?\nAmong those who insist upon hard limits to interstellar travel are many advocates of SETI, which is usually conceived as searching for intelligent extraterrestrial signals, whether radio or optical or otherwise. The two positions\u2014denial of the possibility of interstellar travel and pursuit of SETI\u2014are tightly-coupled, as the unlikelihood of interstellar spacefaring civilization is used to argue for SETI as the only alternative to discovering other life and intelligence in the universe through space exploration.\nPhilip Morrison, who along with Giuseppe Cocconi wrote the first paper on the possibility of SETI, also held this view in regard to, \"\u2026real interstellar travel, where people, intelligent machines, or whatever you like, go out to colonize. You travel in space as Magellan circumnavigated the world."}
{"text":" I do not think this will ever happen. It is very difficult to travel in space.\" [5]\nPerhaps the locus classicus of the SETI paradigm was to be found already in 1962, three years after the Cocconi and Morrison paper:\n\"\u2026space travel, even in the most distant future, will be confined completely to our own planetary system, and a similar conclusion will hold for any other civilization, no matter how advanced it may be. The only means of communication between different civilizations thus seems to be electro-magnetic signals.\" [6]\nAnd here is another clear statement of the SETI paradigm:\n\"The bottom line of all this is quite simply that interstellar travel is so enormously expensive and\/or perhaps hazardous, that advanced civilizations do not engage in the practice because of the ease of information transfer via interstellar communication links.\" [7]\nThe frequency with which cautions regarding the danger of interstellar travel are employed as an argument against interstellar travel suggests that the class of persons writing against interstellar travel are risk averse, but that does not mean that all sectors of society are equally risk averse. Some individuals seek out risk in order to confront \"limit-experiences\" (exp\u00e9rience limite), and never feel so fully as alive as when facing danger, death, and the possibility of personal annihilation. [8]\nIf we set aside the danger of interstellar travel as an artifact of risk aversion, knowing that risk tolerance is one of those individual variations that drives natural selection, we are left with the argument that interstellar spaceflight would be too expensive and too difficult to pursue. The potential cost of interstellar travel is a matter for another essay on another occasion, but I will only observe here that we do not yet know the economics of supercivilizations, so we must keep an open mind as to whether or not interstellar missions would be prohibitively expensive. I do not think that interstellar travel would be too expensive because a fully automated space-based industrial infrastructure, in possession of the energy and materials that are available beyond planetary surfaces, would find few construction projects to be too expensive, as there would be no economic trade-offs between building starships and producing consumer goods.\nThe idea that interstellar travel is enormously difficult I do not dispute, though I find it strange that anyone would argue for the, \"\u2026ease of information transfer via interstellar communication links,\" when these links could not facilitate communication over scales of time relevant to civilization, except for communication with the nearest stars. If there were advanced civilizations located at the nearest stars, with which we might communicate over a time scale of years or even decades, we would already know about these cosmic neighbors. If there are advanced civilizations, then, they must be distant from us, and the greater the distance from us, the more unrealistic it is to imagine that civilizations could communicate on a civilizational scale of time.\nI find it astonishing that those coming from the perspective of the SETI paradigm (which assumes limits on interstellar travel, whether hard or relatively soft limits) imagine an advanced civilization having the patience to wait thousands or tens of thousands of years for a message exchange, but being unwilling to send out interstellar missions operating on a similar scale of time. Here we must imagine supercivilizations who do not have the patience to develop advanced transportation technologies, but which do have the patience to wait thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years, or hundreds of thousands of years, to exchange messages with another civilization. For a stagnant supercivilization, this is easily imaginable and possible, but for a civilization in its growth phase, on the path to attaining supercivilization status, a thousand years of technological development is many times longer than terrestrial technological development since the industrial revolution, which has taken us from sailing ship to spaceship.\nIf a civilization were to send out a message, then collapse some thousands of years later, and the response to the message were then to arrive for some successor civilization still more millennia later, this could be not considered a conversation among civilizations. Under these conditions, only one-way messages make any sense. However, if relativistic spaceflight were to be developed, the intelligent progenitors of a civilization could travel directly to other civilizations and converse with them face-to-face (if both parties to the conversation possessed faces, that is). Now, it is true that civilization on the homeworld of this intelligent progenitor species would experience the same time lapse as beings who stayed on their homeworld and attempted to communicate by conventional SETI means, but those who actually traveled and experienced time dilation could directly experience all that there is to be experienced in the universe. A species in possession of relativistic spaceflight could always arrange for rendezvous with similarly time dilated communities to which they could return. Such a civilization would be \"temporally distributed.\" This is the argument I attempted to make, however imperfectly, in my previous Centauri Dreams post, Stepping Stones Across the Cosmos, though I suppose I didn't explain myself adequately.\nIt beggars belief to suppose"}
{"text":" that a civilization in possession of relativistic spaceflight would choose to remain on its homeworld, waiting for signals thousands or millions of years old, when it could go out into the cosmos and investigate matters firsthand and to engage with the intelligent progenitors of other civilizations (if there are such) as peers, i.e., as fellow beings. I do not say that it is impossible that this should be the case, but it strikes me as extremely unlikely. If human civilization came into possession of relativistic spaceflight technology, and only one percent of the present human population of (more than) seven billion were interested in this development, there would still be seventy million human beings exploring the universe, and arranging rendezvous with groups having experienced similar time dilation and so belonging to the same historical period (and thus having something in common).\nIt is not uncommon, however, to view SETI not as predicated upon the impossibility of interstellar flight, and therefore as a substitute for direct contact, but rather as what we can do right now to establish contact, with interstellar travel still in the offing, yet to play its role when our technology achieves that level of development. In this sense, the SETI paradigm and actual exploration are in no sense inherently in conflict. It is entirely possible that a spacefaring civilization might possess a capability to explore relatively nearby planetary systems and yet eventually find itself at a very great distance from any other civilization, with which it could only communicate by electromagnetic means. Both of these enterprises\u2014exploring nearby planetary systems, even if they have no life and no civilization, and communicating with other civilizations too distant for direct travel\u2014would be profoundly stimulating to a civilization in scientific terms. Nevertheless, the SETI paradigm remains a powerful point of reference because in internal coherency of the assumptions it makes.\nThe advocate of the SETI paradigm must assert that interstellar travel is impossible, because, if it is possible, the idea of a grand Encyclopedia Galactica existing in the form of a network of SETI signals crisscrossing the cosmos is very unlikely to be realized. Thus this cluster of assumptions that I call the SETI paradigm \u2014that interstellar travel is difficult or impossible, that communication is easy, and therefore SETI and METI are, or ought to be, the focus of the efforts of advanced civilizations to interact with peers\u2014hang together by mutual implication. If we reject any one aspect of the paradigm, it falls apart. [9] The SETI enterprise may remain, but it becomes a small part of a big picture, and is no longer the big picture itself.\n[Are we confined to our oasis in space?]\nIs planetary endemism the eternal truth of humanity?\nFor some scientists, not directly concerned with SETI as an alternative for exploration, expressing the difficulty of interstellar travel and the unlikelihood of human beings traveling to other worlds has been a way to express the spirit of seriousness (yes, I am invoking Sartre [10]) in relationship to human planetary endemism, since the prior seriousness of our cosmological disposition (our Ptolemaic centrality) was deprived us by the Copernican revolution. No longer at the center of the universe, and schooled in humility by hundreds of years of Copernicanism, we have become acculturated to our apparently marginal role in the universe, and one way to express this idea is to assert that our marginal status is bound to our marginal homeworld orbiting a marginal star in a marginal galaxy.\nGiven this acculturation, our attachment to our homeworld\u2014rather than being a mere empirical contingency, a truth ready-made by the accident of our origin upon a planetary body\u2014is, as Sartre said, \"\u2026an ethics which is ashamed of itself and does not dare speak its name.\" Instead of saying (though some do say this), \"We ought not to leave Earth,\" the SETI paradigm tells us, \"We cannot leave Earth.\" (The \"ought\" has been transformed into an \"is\"; it is brute fact, and no longer subject to volition.) And if we cannot leave Earth, our special relationship to Earth is retained. What Copernicanism has taken from us with one hand, it gives back with the other. We once again have a \"special\" relationship to Earth, though not the special relationship posited by the Ptolemaic system and its Aristotelian embroiderings.\nFor example, in my earlier Centauri Dreams post How We Get There Matters I quoted this from Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee:\n\"The starships of TV, movies, and novels are products of wishful thinking. Interstellar travel will likely never happen, meaning we are stranded in this solar system forever. We are also likely to be permanently stuck on Earth. It is our oasis in space, and the present is our very special place in time. Humans should enjoy and cherish their day in the Sun on a very special planet and not dwell too seriously on thoughts of unicorns"}
{"text":", minotaurs, mermaids, or the Starship Enterprise. Our experience on Earth is probably repeated endlessly in the cosmos. Life develops on planets but it is ultimately destroyed by the light of a slowly brightening star. It is a cruel fact of nature that life-giving stars always go bad.\" [11]\nEminent entomologist E. O. Wilson [12] went even farther than Ward and Brownlee:\n\"Another principle that I believe can be justified by scientific evidence so far is that nobody is going to emigrate from this planet, not ever.\" [13]\nNote that these are assertions without argument, though they invoke scientific evidence without actually arguing from scientific evidence. (I am going to quote more of the latter passage in another post to come, as it perfectly exemplifies a particular perspective on the human condition.)\nThese extrapolations beyond the SETI paradigm are arguably more damaging than the SETI paradigm itself, because it raises planetary endemism to a metaphysical status, seeking to overturn the essence of the Copernican revolution. The original formulations of the SETI paradigm were made by scientists who had clear and unambiguous reasons for favoring SETI communication over actual exploration, but those who have taken up the SETI paradigm as a way to express their skepticism about a spacefaring future have no such reasons, or, if they have them, they do not state them.\n[Ludwig Wittgenstein]\nAre we dealing with implicit proscriptions?\nIt could be that those who argue for hard limits to interstellar travel are incorporating implicit boundaries to the discussion, which, not having been made explicit, have not been part of the argument. This is particularly true in relation to a discussion of supercivilizations, which I will try to show below.\nWittgenstein noted such implicit proscriptions in a passage from his Philosophical Investigations:\n\"Someone says to me, 'Show the children a game.' I teach them gambling with dice, and the other says, 'I didn't mean that sort of game.' In that case, must he have had the exclusion of the game with dice before his mind when he gave me the order?\" [14]\nThis is how people most often talk at cross-purposes, and so we must make an effort to bring such presuppositions to the surface and make them explicit. What I particularly have in mind in regard to implicit boundaries to the scope of a discussion is the possibility that when someone says, \"Interstellar travel is impossible,\" what they really mean to say is that, \"Interstellar travel is impossible within a given time horizon,\" or, \"Interstellar travel is impossible based on known science and technology.\" This is of interest to me in the present context because the longevity of a supercivilization would presumably exceed the bounds of some ordinarily assumed time horizon, so that while most discussion of civilization would not need to address interstellar travel, it might still be allowed that interstellar travel is possible for supercivilizations, and ought to be discussed in relation to them.\nSome of the quotes above seem to clearly rule out implicit qualifications to the assertions being made. For example, the quote from Sebastian von Hoerner explicitly stipulates that, \"\u2026space travel, even in the most distant future, will be confined completely to our own planetary system, and a similar conclusion will hold for any other civilization, no matter how advanced it may be.\" [emphasis added] This doesn't seem to leave much room for ambiguity. We need to take von Hoerner at his word, and see what it would mean for a civilization to be incapable of interstellar travel regardless of its age or its technological achievements, regardless of where it finds itself in the universe or in the history of the cosmos.\nWithout making any implicit boundaries of a discussion explicit, the denial of the possibility of interstellar travel becomes the denial of the possibility of interstellar travel by any civilization (1), at any stage of development (2), at any time in the history of the universe (3), by any means (4), and at any location within the universe (5). This would be a very strong assertion to make, and I can't imagine that many would agree to it if they fully understood that which they were implicitly asserting. [15]\nWe could take these five implied conditions in turn and formulate how these implicit qualifications to the denial of the possibility of interstellar travel might be formulated if made explicit:\n1. Yes, interstellar travel is impossible for our civilization, but not necessarily for some other kind of civilization, and not necessarily impossible for a supercivilization.\n2. Yes, interstellar travel is impossible for our civilization at its present stage of development, but given a sufficiently long-lived civilization interstellar travel might be possible.\n3. Yes, interstellar travel is impossible at the present time in the history of the universe, but it may be possible at some other time when, for instance, another star approaches the sun closely enough for us to travel to it. [16]\n4. Yes, interstellar"}
{"text":" travel is impossible for known technologies, but we may yet develop technologies that will make it possible, or these technologies may be developed by other kinds civilizations.\n5. Yes, interstellar travel is impossible for us, located in a diffusely populated arm of our spiral galaxy, but it might be possible for civilizations located in regions of the galaxy where stars are more closely spaced (such as galactic centers, globular clusters, or merely closely-packed regions of elliptical galaxies).\nWhen we put together the possibilities of different kinds of civilizations (including the different kind of civilization our civilization may become in the future), at different stages of development, at different times in the natural history of the universe, involving different means of transportation, and in other parts of the universe when stars are not as diffusely distributed, it seems a bit contrarian (and I don't mean that in a flattering way) to insist that any and all interstellar travel is impossible.\nA further implicit qualification may be present. Disavowals of the possibility of interstellar travel might be interpreted as specifically addressing the known cosmological circumstances for terrestrial civilization only, or such might be more widely interpreted as holding for any civilization that shares Earth's cosmological circumstances, or, more widely yet, may hold for civilization whatsoever. In the narrowest of these three senses, the implicit qualification may be made explicit by asserting the proviso, \"Well, yes, interstellar travel might be possible under these circumstances, addressing the above qualifications as we have done, but since we are likely the only civilization in the galaxy, the particular cosmological circumstances of Earth and terrestrial civilization are the only cosmological circumstances that really count. A civilization located in a globular cluster where stars are less than a light year apart might be able to pursue interstellar travel, but there are no civilizations; this class of civilizations is the empty set, so we may set it aside.\"\nBy this same reasoning, any consideration of what supercivilizations might accomplish can also be set aside, because terrestrial civilization is not a supercivilization, and if we limit ourselves to what terrestrial civilization is now, and what it can do now, where it is located now, and so on, then we can dismiss the possibility of interstellar travel. (We can also dismiss any future for ourselves other than an eternally-iterated present.) Moreover, we have no particular reason to believe that terrestrial civilization will become a supercivilization, even if it survives for thousands of years or more. Whether or not a civilization does or can develop into a supercivilization may be entirely a matter of mere historical contingency, and, in this sense, the particular cosmological circumstances of Earth will mean the difference between whether terrestrial civilization can develop into a supercivilization, or if it will inevitably fail to do so. Moreover, whether or not a supercivilization stagnates or continues to develop may also be entirely a matter of mere historical contingency (an artifact of galactic endemism, as it were).\n[\"\u2026we have all entered the Interstellar Age.\" Jim Bell]\nIs interstellar travel inevitable for long-lived civilizations?\nWhen we combine technologies already known to us, despite our rudimentary development as a technological civilization, and the changing circumstances of the galaxies, which will, over a cosmological scale of time, move some stars closer to us (as other stars move farther from us), denying the possibility of eventual interstellar travel is like denying the possibility of what is already known. It is arguable, then, that interstellar travel is inevitable for supercivilizations. If a civilization persists for a period of time sufficient to become a supercivilization, it would persist through additional stages of development, through changing distances among stars, and through changing cosmological conditions, so that a settled and deliberate avoidance of interstellar travel would seem to be a precondition of a very old and advanced civilizations that never achieved interstellar breakout. We cannot rule this out, but we also cannot assume that every civilization will cultivate a settled and deliberate avoidance of space travel.\nWe are already capable of sending out a spacecraft into interstellar space. The \"grand tour\" gravitational assist of the Voyager probes has already sent Voyager 1 outside the solar system, though that was not part of the original mission of that spacecraft, and the spacecraft is not on a trajectory specifically tailored to encounter another star (though it may pass near another star over sufficiently long scales of time). But Voyager is in interstellar space, and in virtue of this Jim Bell has asserted, \"\u2026now the Voyagers are leaving the protective bubble of our sun and crossing over into the uncharted territory between the stars\u2026 we have all entered the Interstellar Age.\" [17] By this measure, terrestrial civilization has already achieved interstellar breakout.\nThe gravitational assist that has been extensively employed to send robotic probes throughout our solar system, if specifically tailored to interstellar purposes, could significantly improve on Voyager's trajectory in terms of getting a spacecraft to another planetary system. Given the possibility of an interstellar gravitational assist (cf. The Interstellar Gravitational Assist by Paul Gilster), and the possibility"}
{"text":" of selecting a trajectory specifically for the purpose to traveling to a star brought relatively nearby to us (i.e., optimizing the gravitational assist for an interstellar trajectory), even if terrestrial civilization stagnated at or near its present technological level of development, it would still be capable of interstellar travel if it endures for a sufficient period of time.\nSimilar considerations hold civilizations that happen to find themselves in cosmological circumstances more amenable to interstellar travel. In their paper \"Globular Clusters as Cradles of Life and Advanced Civilizations\" (which I discussed in The Globular Cluster Opportunity), R. Di Stefano and A. Ray discuss the possibilities for advanced spacefaring civilizations in globular clusters, where stars are more closely distributed and travel times between stars and their planetary systems would therefore be shorter than travel times among stars as we typically find them distributed in the arms of spiral galaxies. [18]\n[\"Assembling a Space Station\" by Klaus B\u00fcrgle]\nWould we recognize another stagnant supercivilization as a peer?\nEven without \"breakthrough\" technologies, utilizing the science and technology available to a civilization a couple of hundred years into its industrial revolution, interstellar flight is conceivable, and, under some circumstances, practicable. Unique cosmological circumstances in which relatively low technological interstellar travel is possible may serve as incubators for spacefaring civilizations, which, under this unique selection pressure, would be more likely to develop the sciences and technologies conducive to the expansion of spacefaring civilization, and which would definitely lead to the development of the practical engineering skills necessary to (even nearby) interstellar travel.\nSuch a civilization would have far more practical engineering experience in spacecraft and living in space than we possess, even if it did not possess any science or technology that we do not also possess. To a certain degree (though not to an absolute degree), engineering expertise can vary independently of scientific knowledge and technological development. (Technologies have often grown out of engineering experience, so that technology and engineering tend to be more tightly-coupled than science and engineering.) We are reminded of this when we consider the lithic technology of Pleistocene human beings, or the stone-working technologies of early civilizations and their monumental architecture, the particular engineering techniques of which have been lost, and which are thus mysterious to us. Analogously, a spacefaring civilization with greater engineering experience in space than contemporary terrestrial civilization, but no greater scientific knowledge, initially might appear mysterious to us.\nA truly ambitious civilization of this kind, perhaps not greatly technologically advanced, but with a determination to project itself into the cosmos, could, over cosmological scales of time (if it could survive that long), pass from one planetary system to another as stars passed nearby each other, pursuing a strategy of opportunistic interstellar travel, hopping from one nearly planetary system to the next, as the occasion presented itself. Such a civilization need not be advanced much beyond the level contemplated by Wernher von Braun in his mid-twentieth century plans for a space program that could ultimately, \"\u2026build a bridge to the stars, so that when the Sun dies, humanity will not die.\" [19] A rudimentary spacefaring civilization of this kind could, over millions of years, expand throughout a significant portion of the galaxy. They might even be so \"quiet\" in electromagnetic terms, and leave such a light footprint on the galaxy, that we do not see them coming.\nIt would be a shock for us on Earth if we were eventually \"discovered\" by some civilization less technologically advanced than we are, but more keen on space exploration, and willing to invest blood and treasure in the effort when terrestrial civilization is not yet willing to invest in the enterprise. For if terrestrial civilization endures to become a supercivilization, but remains tightly-coupled to its homeworld, fearful to extend its reach into the cosmos, we are likely to be \"discovered\" rather than being the ones to do the discovering. Carl Sagan once wrote, \"The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean\u2026 Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls.\" [20] Though the ocean calls, we have hesitated on the shore. Given a sufficiently long period of time\u2014a scale of time over which a supercivilization might endure\u2014there may be other civilizations that do not hesitate.\nIn my last Centuari Dreams post, Synchrony in Outer Space, I argued that civilizations can retrench from development that becomes so rapid as to be disorienting and socially disruptive, and that this may have happened with the mid-twentieth century space program, which was defunded and neglected after the Apollo Program, but which could have been expanded, had the political will been present (cf. Late-Adopter Spacefaring Civilization: the Preemption that Didn't Happen). In the event of a (counterfactual) expansion of"}
{"text":" the mid-twentieth century space program, the history of terrestrial civilization would have bifurcated sharply from the path it did in fact take.\nIf we encountered a civilization that had taken an earlier path to spacefaring civilization, would we recognize them as the path not taken by terrestrial civilization, as being, in a sense, a peer civilization? This would be the meeting of two different kinds of stagnant supercivilizations\u2014one that stagnated scientifically, but which expanded beyond its homeworld, and another that continued to expand the frontiers of scientific knowledge, but which stagnated on its homeworld\u2014neither of them the kind of supercivilization that runs into the limit of the carrying capacity of the galaxy, and neither of them in possession of relativistic spaceflight technology.\nThese two civiilzations, supercivilizations in virtue of having endured for cosmologically significant periods of time, might be identified as instances of partially stagnant civilizations, and, in this sense, suboptimal civilizations (more specifically, suboptimal supercivilizations). If we acknowledge the possibility of suboptimal partially stagnant civilizations, we would not be surprised that such civilizations had not exhaustively colonized the entire galaxy, and that they had not built a powerful SETI beacon. Many such civilizations might be simultaneously present in the galaxy and yet know nothing of each other. This could be called the \"suboptimal hypothesis\" in response to the Fermi paradox.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[1] \"On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations,\" Nikolai S.

The result of the serious attitude, which as we know rules the world, is to cause the symbolic values of things to be drunk in by their empirical idiosyncrasy as ink by a blotter; it puts forward the opacity of the desired object and posits it in itself as a desirable irreducible. Thus we are already on the moral plane but concurrently on that of bad faith, for it is an ethics which is ashamed of itself and does not dare speak its name.

So you still need actual physical space flight to separate them to cosmological distances. Now, there is physics we don't know yet, and this may change the possibilities for communication.

Wilson and Kim Stanley Robinson, is an implacable hostility towards pioneering of the Jackson\/Heinlein context. I believe this motivation serves as the basis of their opinions on this matter.\nIt would be worthwhile to analyze the ideologies involved in \"staying home\" vs. cosmic expansion, which would be an analysis of nascent ideologies not yet fully formed. If a civilization launches itself upon exploratory journeys in the cosmos, these experiences are likely to profoundly affect the moral and intellectual development of intelligent progenitor species involved in the exploration and expansion, so that the ideologies that inspired these efforts would be changed by their implementation.\nIt is difficult for me personally to understand the hostility that you mention, though I have encountered it, so I know it's a common view and I would like to be able to understand it. It is not clear to me if this is a temperamental expression of individual variability (and therefore ultimately biological in origin, which in this instance means an expression of our evolutionary psychology) or if it is more cultural and due to particular features of education, acculturation, and the peculiarities of the present stage of the development of our civilization. Nature vs. nurture. I guess it's probably both.\nAs an American, I can only talk about the situation in the U.S. There are two major political factions, the liberal-left and the alt-right, that are \"illiberal\" in the John Locke classical liberal sense. Of the two, the liberal-left is entirely inimical to pioneering and autonomy by self-interested groups. This view is summed up in the recent Kim Stanley Robinson novels. The alt-right, on the other hand, is not necessarily hostile to pioneering per se. But much of their writings is couched in a semi-feudal terms in a manner that they seem to glorify the medieval period in Europe, which was certainly not about pioneering at all. More specifically, they express hostility towards Lockean classical liberalism, which I consider to be the philosophical root of pioneering in the Jackson\/Heinleinien context.\nI have visited various European countries on business. But I lived in various East Asian countries for 10 years. I can tell you that nearly every European I met does not have a pioneering bone in their body. Its as though they are culturally and even genetically hostile to pioneering in any form.\nThe East Asian people, particularly the Chinese, are the consummate traders of the world (e.g. Overseas Chinese of SE Asia). The Japanese and Koreans much less so. However, these people as well do not have a pioneering bone in their bodies either (as my Japanese wife will freely admit).\nPioneering appears to be an Anglo-American thing, if not exclusively American.\nMichael July 30, 2017, 14:27\n'I can tell you that nearly every European I met does not have a pioneering bone in their body.

Currently, there is nowhere on Earth that can be \"pioneered\" or \"settled\" that has any value and that isn't already under some government's control.\nHeinlein's protagonists were settling worlds that were basically New Earths and suitable for farming. We have no knowledge of any such worlds. As our knowledge of biospheres and ecosystems has vastly expanded since Heinlein was writing his stories, we are less optimistic that such worlds would be suitable for human settlement or even that they should be.\nHumans exploiting any world or moon are more likely to be like Asimov's \"spacers\", relying on robots to do the heavy lifting, not like Asimov's \"Earthers\" or Heinlein's gritty individualists recapitulating the colonizing of the N. American continent.\nExploiting and even settling another world is going to look a lot more like the exploitation of offshore oil, a project that requires huge capital resources and expertise that is aggregated into groups.

In the not too distant past, Russians pushed eastward into Siberia and southernly into the Caucusus region \u2014 Tolstoy wrote stories about such. In the 16th century Spaniards and Portuguese mariners split the world between themselves, and then were pushed aside by the French and the Dutch (and the English). A few centuries before that, Germany pioneers pushed through what became Prussia and Poland. And before that there were Vikings.\nThere's an element in most societies, it strikes me, that would explore and loot or maybe even explore and settle, given proper circumstances. Perhaps we lack such circumstances. Other hand, it might be that the \"proper circumstances\" include poverty and desperation \u2014 something hinted occasionally in those Heinlein novels \u2014 in which case that modern humans seem to lack the essential spirit for pioneering might not be something to lament.\nA particular concern of mine, and one of the reasons I advocate for a short term push to build von Neumann machines, (Which we should be capable of within just a couple decades if we try.) is the possibility that our push into space will be gradual, resulting in our population growing in proportion to our resources, and no faster.\nFast interstellar travel requires the expenditure of huge resources per mission, and if manned, even vaster per passenger. It isn't going to happen unless our infrastructure grows enormously faster than our population.\nCan't you see that future: We expand into space, using chemical and solar powered rockets, and human dependent production, our population growing as we expand, until in the far distant future the Solar system is fully populated, without the excess resources to devote to a task as extravagant as interstellar exploration, because our needs have grown in synch with our capacities? The huge resources of the Solar system matched by a huge population.\nIn that scenario we probably still expand into the galaxy, comets and Kupier belt objects will eventually be colonized, and we'll cross the interstellar depths by slow diffusion, as our own thinning constellation of objects blends imperceptively into the next stars' cometary belt.\nThat's not stagnation, as such, because we'd be spreading at the borders, but it's not a glorious future of relativistic travel and a galaxy claimed by human kind in under a million years.\nJ. N. Nielsen August 2, 2017, 17:00\nIt's a good point to note that a civilization slowly diffusing through its own planetary system could grow outward into the Kuiper belt and the Oort Cloud, and my the time there is a presence in the Oort cloud you're almost half way to the next star. Sure conditions get more difficult the further out you go \u2014 less sunlight and fewer resources \u2014 but by the time this is possible the expanding civilization ought to have a great deal of experience in these matters.\nI think it's important to note that we do not yet know the economics of interstellar expansion. You suggest that fast interstellar voyages may be too expensive to sustain for a civilization focusing its resources on the maintenance of a vastly expanded population, but I think in the long term, if the technologies of fast interstellar travel prove to be practicable (this is something we also do not yet know), then this will be less expensive than the equally grand vision of a system-wide civilization building vast arks \u2014 generational starships \u2014 and sending them"}
{"text":" out into the cosmos.\nAs Darwin said, \"There is grandeur in this view of life,\" by which I mean the dispersion of life throughout the cosmos, whether by rapid relativistic means, in less than a million years, or by much slower means, which will come to maturity only over a billion years or more. The ultimate practicability of the various technologies we can now envision will be the deciding factor of the order of temporal magnitude of the dispersion of terrestrial life into the universe.\nThere is a lot in this post to discuss. :)\nRegarding the term \"stagnation\". Stagnation can mean different things. Discussed was ecological maximization. That limit can only be reached when the resources of the universe are fully and most completely used to green it. In our neck of the woods, that means creating a huge number of space habitats by dismantling the planets. The population size of such a civilization is many orders of magnitude larger than ours.\nEconomic growth is likely to stagnate too. Our recent historic rate of ~3% pa is not sustainable for very long. Exponential growth soon exceeds that of a Sol system. and surprisingly quite quickly reaches the limits of the galaxy. (< 1 millennium to expand 400 billion fold from a Sol sized economy.)\nWhat isn't likely to stagnate is the sheer number of possible states that civilizations could attempt to create. Just recreating one small historical culture and replaying it so that chance changes outcomes would generate a vast number of new versions. That game has the capacity to rapidly exhaust all of space and time.\nSo as long as civilizations are not totally static, they should be able to evolve and create new information indefinitely, even if it means restarting from a defined historical and knowledge base periodically.\nAndrei July 29, 2017, 3:49\nThis is how I interpret the word stagant too.\nIt would not be a golden age civilization in complete lifelong vacation.\nPerhaps part of the population might choose that, or to live in fantasy worlds created in habitats or computer generated illusion.\nEarth today is already getting very close to the limit. Not because of technical limitation but because governments and industry choose to make products that drain limited resources and create harmful waste products.\nEven if a super civilisation colonise all worlds and moons, or covert all matter completely in big engineering, there would still be economic activity.\nAnd that activity could very well be in ecologic cycles, even if it might be from the collectors of whoopee cushions. ;)\nGeoffrey Hillend July 28, 2017, 16:34\nQuote by J. Nielsen: \"one that stagnated scientifically, but which expanded beyond its homeworld, and another that continued to expand the frontiers of scientific knowledge, but which stagnated on its homeworld\u2014\" This is impossible or science fiction. There is no such civilization that could have any kind of interstellar travel without scientific knowledge. There is no industry without physics or science.\nAny civilization that started interstellar travel before us must be much more advanced than us. They evolved before us; Their star system most likely was born before ours or there home planet's giant impact occurred before ours which would result in a faster evolution.\nBased on today's technological progress which is very slow, practical interstellar travel for people is two million years. This is a conservative view which does not include superluminal technology which might result in an earlier interstellar capability. We could have a breakthrough with FTL technology which would result in an earlier time but that time would still be long like a million years. The reason being is that it takes enormous energy.\nThere are world ships, but those are still ahead of our technology today. World ships suffer from the idea that they take too long to get too their destination or are too expensive and dangerous since we can send robot or automated craft or probes in the place or we might build a faster technology which would make them obsolete.\nThat's not really true; There's still Orion, which may be banned by treaty, but is still within our current technology, and capable of manned interstellar flight on the order of a few percent of C.\ndavid lewis July 28, 2017, 16:36\nDepending on the civilization, interstellar travel could be easy. Very easy. There would be a single massive wave of colonization when the parent civilization builds a hundred billion ships and sends them out. Even at a mere 1\/1000th of the speed of light it would only take 100 million years to fully colonize the galaxy. Of course they would be self-repairing robotic ships, but they would be able to recreated the builders once they arrive.\nPerhaps that explains the Fermi paradox. 400 million years ago someone did just that and colonized all the rocky planets with high levels of oxygen in their atmosphere. The Earth, not having a high level of oxygen, didn't get colonized. Then the civilization stagnated, or evolved, or is planning a second wave every 1 billion years to grab planets like the"}

Sure the idea has problems, but so does every Fermi paradox solution.\nEven with our current technology we could, with enough time and motivation, build an Orion style interstellar vessel. Whether or not the crew could build a new civilization upon arrival is in question though.\nSETI, in my opinion, is not about saying we shouldn't become an interstellar species, but about looking where we're going rather than taking a blind leap and trusting only in faith that we can hope to know where we will land. People don't put on a blindfold when they get into a car to drive \u2013 they used both eyes to watch where they're going. Those that don't might avoid the inevitable for a while, but will eventually end up in an accident.

Of course there is no way in hell for some random exotica with 1M proton + 1M neutron to exist naturally or artificially; the real limits are based in mathematical consistencies but when one stays too far from the physical boundaries, this becomes SF delusions.\nI too am very skeptical that interstellar travel won't happen in some form. There are just too many options from low tech to high tech and different acceptable time frames.\nI personally suspect that our post-human travelers will be synthetic, the \"robot\" option [IIRC] from a previous post by Nielsen. Like spaceprobes that can have their software changed by remote upload, such synthetics might well offer a way for minds to travel between the stars, whether by em signals or by physical media. Careful timing would allow groups to experience communication with different civs and yet still regroup at the same time and place in the future.\nCommunication can be \"blurred\" in meaning if a civ sends a data dump of its state with an AI that could converse with the target civ. While it doesn't meet the criterion of a civ-to-civ conversation, perhaps we need to think less about such homeworld to homeworld conversations and just accept that travelers meeting still constitutes useful exchange that might eventually affect the descendants of the participating civs. Historically, had none of Columbus' crew ever returned home, would the communication between his crew and the American natives not have constituted a communication even though Spain did not get to participate?\nAs in my previous comment, I think this allows any encompassing super-civ to endlessly explore new patterns that will continue to find new ones until the end of the universe.\nJames Stilwell July 28, 2017, 18:18\nBy 2035 the High definition Space Telescope with its 40 foot mirror orbiting the sun should keep your curiosity percolating\u2026There are too many unknowns concerning super-civilizations\u2026Somebody here said only yesterday that we are a sample of one\u2026stay patient\u2026be prepared for surprises\u2026new knowledge changes so many suppositions\u2026Look where America was in 1835\u2026Lucky America changes\u2026Ancient Rome didn't change\u2026they went back to the land and abandoned Rome\u2026Now Rome has regenerated despite all the tough centuries\u2026You've read Asimov and the Foundation and Hari Seldon\u2026regeneration is one of nature's favorite paths\u2026regardless of who says what\u2026\nHaxo Angmark July 28, 2017, 19:14\nI am old enough to remember the late 1940's-early 1950's uproar over \"breaking the Sound Barrier\".

The time from copernicus manuscript to gaileo was 100 years. When heliocentrism became dominant, not only did the view of the solar system change so did the view of the universe since heliocentrism required stars to be much more distant. If FTL travel is possible then the science needs to catch up with the theories.\nChristopher Phoenix August 1, 2017, 20:28\nHonestly, comparing the sound barrier with the light barrier is a very bad analogy. They are entirely different things.\nAnd then what's-his-name and the X-1 did it under measured conditions, and that was that. Exactly the same will prove true for the Light Barrier, IF ours or some other galactic civilization lasts long enough. And therein lies the problem.\nFirst off, there was no question whether the so-called \"sound barrier\" could be broken. Bullets and whips have been breaking the sound barrier for centuries (indeed, the sound of a whip crack is a small sonic boom). The question was purely whether an aircraft could break the sound barrier in controlled flight. Earlier aviators found things to behave quite differently in the transonic regime once their aircraft hit those speeds, and tended to lose control.\nBut we know of nothing that travels faster than light, locally. And relativity, which is supported by a rather convincing amount of evidence, suggests that nothing that carries energy or information can outrace light. Worse, if we assume something can anyway, in relativity you can construct scenarios in which FTL trips result in time travel and causality violations.\nAll that the statement \"they said we'd never break the sound barrier, but we did, so the light barrier will be the same\" expresses is a blind faith that every predicted natural limit to our activities will be overcome by human ingenuity and technology. It's equivalent to stating that there are no natural limits on our activities, and this is simply not true. Just look at the history of perpetual motion.\nFirst off, this is a commonly repeated misconception. See misconception #3 in this paper: Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the universe. Also the expansion of the universe is something rather different than a speed, so cosmologists complain that saying the universe expands faster than light is hopelessly incorrect. See this post explaning why the universe never expands faster than the speed of light.\nThat aside, you are referring to the Alcubierre Metric. The idea that a spacecraft might achieve apparent FTL but riding a wave of expanding and contracting spacetime is intriguing, but unfortunately it's still an entirely mathematical construct that may not be physically meaningful. Galaxies do not travel faster than light by warping spacetime. They, like us, are embedded in the expanding spacetime of the universe. Alcubierre Drive requires controlling or \"engineering\" spacetime, an entirely different matter.\nAnd you need negative mass (typically an astronomical quantity of it) to create this metric, not dark energy. Assuming we can figure that out, we then have the issue"}

Surdin in the 1980s (\u0421\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0412.\u0413. \u0428\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b SETI \/\/ \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0446\u0438\u0440\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440, \u2116 1357, \u0441. 3-6, 1985.).\nIn addition, the movement of the stars can be controlled in the presence of very limited resources, and these technologies are also already known (Shkadov, L. M. \"Possibility of controlling solar system motion in the galaxy, \u00ab38th Congress of the \u2026\u00bb, October 10-17, 1987, Brighton, UK, paper IAA-87-613.).\nThis completely changes the paradigm of interstellar flight as a contradiction with the life on the inhabited planets (by Edward Wilson, etc.), as the contradiction is removed.\nLiterally in the near future I will present material on this subject.\nThanks. I should have mentioned the Shkadov thruster in this post, as it operates over the time scales I examine in this essay, and it would speed up the process of bringing other planetary systems within easy spacefaring range of a civilization without exotic drive technologies. The idea of a Shkadov thruster is pretty basic, the question, then, would be whether building a Shkadov thruster around one's own star would take engineering expertise beyond what could be expected from a rudimentary spacefaring civilization. Obviously, we could define a number of stages of spacefaring sophistication and differentiate those capable to carrying this off, and those not so capable. The distance scales of the universe would then become a strong selective effect: those civilizations capable of mastering the engineering of a Shkadov thruster would have \"first mover\" advantage in settling the galaxy and displacing any lower technology rivals, or leaving nothing available (no unoccupied real estate) for Johnny-come-lately spacefaring civilizations.\nDmitry Novoseltsev August 31, 2017, 12:12\nSee https:\/\/i4is.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Principium18%20Aug2017%20opt.pdf (pp. 31-41) as one variant."}

Suboptimality occupies a position somewhere between a glorious onward and upward future on the one hand, and, on the other hand, ignominious failure.\nMichael Hutson July 29, 2017, 16:59\nAbout civilizations reaching carrying capacity:\nFirst, as a formerly expanding civilization reaches the limits of resources there may be a tendency to overshoot, due to the inertia of a civilization reforming itself from the values of an expanding \"frontier\" (in figurative terms of development if not literally in terms of colonization) culture to a steady-state culture. Thus a civilization might temporarily over-utilize finite resources, then suffer a crash due to their depletion, before finally reaching an equilibrium. The curve showing the civilization's approach to K the carrying capacity might have a squiggle or two of over\/undershoot before leveling out at K.\nSecond, the maximum utilization of resources possible given the laws of physics may not be realized in one go. A civilization might reach the limits of the technology available to it, fall into a near-steady state for a period, and only then make a technological breakthrough which wasn't possible until a sufficient economy of scale was reached. To imagine one hypothetical, it might be possible to develop a technology based on manipulating gravity but only after engineering on a literally astronomical scale becomes practical: creating artificial neutron stars from stellar-mass quantities of iron for example. So the approach to the absolute limits to what's physically achievable may characterized by a number of temporary plateaus rather than a single development curve.\nI thought about using a"}
{"text":" graph showing overshoot (there are many of these available that I could have adapted), but I chose the flat line K for the sake of simplicity, but you're absolutely right that one would expect to see an overshoot and then an oscillation around the K mark.\nAlso, I agree that it is likely that spacefaring buildout will occur in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back fashion rather than a linear (or, rather, sigmoid) convergence upon K. In a more sophisticated formulation of the suboptimal hypothesis to come (fate willing), I will argue that convergence upon K, far from being inevitable, would be very rare, even if there are mulitple spacefaring civilizations developing under conditions conducive to their continued growth. Too many things can happen over a million year time span that would derail a steady sigmoid growth curve to carrying capacity. On Earth, on much smaller scales of space and time, organisms routinely converge on K, but at the scale of supercivilizations I think this will be exceedingly unlikely and therefore rare.\nIn any case, you've written a very nice summary in two paragraphs, and this sort of approach could be fruitfully developed as a way to study spacefaring civilizations, eventually providing some numbers to a quantifiable formalism, as I suggested in my response to the questions posed by Al Jackson (above).\nAndrew Palfreyman July 29, 2017, 21:04\nWe will accomplish interstellar travel because the stars are there.\n(pace the late Sir Edmund Hillary)\nIt was George Mallory, who died attempting to summit Everest, who said, \"Because it's there.\"\nOne of the ideas in the book Frontiers of Propulsion science is a gravitational wave rocket. As we explore the depths of matter at an even smaller scale with higher energies we will discover the graviton. If not in the LHC, it will occur in a larger, more powerful collider. It is just a matter of time before we can make the technology to manipulate the force of gravity. I doubt we will ever have to wait long enough to make supernovas and neutron stars to achieve that.\nThe possibilities for the physics we don't yet know are fascinating, and if new physics produces novel technologies for us to travel through the cosmos, then all the better. But what if the scientific stagnation of our civilization becomes so entrenched that we never build a collider more powerful than the LHC (and its eventual updates)? Suppose scientific knowledge (in physics) stagnates at the level that can be provided by research run on the LHC and its upgrades. We may never get to the point when we can put quantum theory and general relativity together, and the technology to control gravity would remain beyond our ability.\nIn this case, if we were to travel through the universe, we would have to choose between methods known to us on the basis of contemporary physics (slow travel such as I described above, generational starships, relativistic travel, and so on). One of the things that I have tried to show here is that this latter option isn't really all that bad. It would take a long time for such a civilization to occupy its own galaxy, but it could be done over hundreds of millions of years if a civilization could endure for that long.\nAl Jackson July 31, 2017, 9:36\nOf note about traveling the universe.\nDistance = speed X time\nWhat if the travelers master time rather than speed?\nI mean mastering biological time by techno-bio-physics-electro-cyber-robo-augmented-\u2026you-name-it.

{"text":" reached\u2026.\nOne explanation for'stagnation' would be immortality of individuals and collectively, the entirety of a civilization by way of migration from organic to non-organic quantum minds. Communication\/sharing via quantum entanglement allows a civilization to appear stagnant to organic life, as the 'quantum civilization' would not experience 'time' as the organic one would. Migration to 'quantum state' would drastically alter resource consumption, reducing consumption to maintenance requirements. Interstellar activity would be done for a much different reason \u2013 the dispatch of probes with 'instantaneous quantum entanglement' capability, for the purpose of instatanously expanding the 'virtual experience' and knowledge of the civilization. Bottom line, stagnant super civilizations would not engage in interstellar travel, however, they continually 'expand' and experience the universe at all 'levels' of existence.\nYour suggestion is close to John Smart's \"transcension hypothesis\":\nhttp:\/\/accelerating.org\/articles\/transcensionhypothesis.html\nIt's worth reading if you're not familiar with this line of argument. Smart and those associated with him (like Cadell Last, whom I heard speak at the second IBHA conference) are highly critical of the \"expansion hypothesis,\" so this is very different from my own approach, which is much closer to the expansion hypothesis. I've been meaning to write a Centauri Dreams post focusing specifically on the expansion hypothesis and its critics, but I haven't made the time for that yet.\nWhen I was writing the above I actually had a modified version of Smart's transcension hypothesis in the back of my mind as the foil to the slowly expanding (relatively) low technology spacefaring civilization. A suboptimal transcension would still leave a civilization tightly-coupled to its homeworld with a somewhat robust relationships with the outside world, i.e., this would not yet be a civilization entirely turned inward on itself, living exclusively in virtual worlds. The vulgar version of this would be sitting on the couch, eating potato chips, and playing immersive video games until the end of time.

It strikes me that though the civilisation described in Clarke's book appears pretty stagnant at the outset, the deeper truth discovered in the book is that some of the designers of the civilisation (and it certainly *is* designed) deliberately created a mechanism whereby the society can free itself from the bounds imposed on it. It can release itself from the designed-in stasis at recurring intervals if the conditions for doing so are right. The apparently'stagnant' society might really then be conceived as an engineering solution for achieving a very long term civilisational goal. Without going into the thinking and purposes of the designers in the novel, I think we can take the more general point that stasis and civilisational stagnancy might actually be used as a tool \u2013 a means to an end and with an inbuilt 'de-stagnate' contingency mechanism. Further that civilisation itself might actually be something that could be engineered.\nGiven the bloodbath that was the twentieth century, I suspect thinking along these lines gives a lot of people the creeping horrors. Nevertheless, it doesn't break the laws of physics, and some other civilisations might find it easier to tackle than perhaps ourselves.\nAlso on the subject of not needing to break the laws of physics, consider that we could send earth creatures to another star and have them live out their lives there right now. Tardigrades, once dehydrated, turn into little blobs called 'tuns'. A tun can be cooled down to absolute zero. Once warmed back up again and rehydrated, the tardigrade will come back to life and start wandering around doing its thing. At absolute zero, all chemical processes halt, entropy ceases to increase and time itself essentially stops. A tardigrade tun at absolute zero in a radiation hardened box could make the trip to another star even at a voyager-level snailpace. As long as the machinery for warming it up again"}
{"text":" at the far end worked without problem we would have successfully sent living animals to another star system.\nBy simple extension, if we could figure out a way to cool a human being down to absolute zero, leave them there for the span of a tea break, and then reheat and revive them again, then this in itself would solve the \"interstellar travel\" puzzle. Fifteen minutes at absolute zero is the same as fifteen thousand years, given strong radiation protection. We don't need to do any clever new physics to transport people to other stars, just clever biology. And lets not forget that this would also enable time travel into the future without any physical travel through space itself, providing us some other capabilities and options, such as have been discussed on CD elsewhere.\nThink about the wealth and power created by super-automated, hands-off manufacturing by self-replicating hardware (something that I think really needs a naming), the energy resources of a star and the material resources of a planetary system. Now think about the power for direct exploration of space afforded by cryogenics (should this be achievable) coupled with the limited space transport technology we already understand how to create. These things together provide *opportunities* to extend a civilisation's reach both physically outwards and temporally onwards. The component missing with trying to suss out whether long term stagnation is on the cards is purpose. One might consider our present planetary civilisation's purpose, such as it has one, as the meeting of the material needs of its inhabitants. Before this century is out, if we can avoid destroying ourselves, we will be in a position to meet those needs with minimal time, effort or attention from ourselves. The questions of what purpose we will then create for ourselves are already starting to make themselves felt. Thinkers such as Nick Bostrom are looking into existential risks. We could use some more attention paid to the existential opportunities!\nMarshall McLuhan said that the media is the the message; perhaps it could turn out to be greater and maybe actually defining of our civilisation going forward. We have moved so quickly along the curve of new media forms and accelerated networking and social problem solving capability in the last twenty years that we are far, far from any sort of equilibrium or even understanding of what the limits are here. In a world knit far more tightly together perhaps we will converge on a means of articulating and actualising common purposes that we have not yet imagined. A true civilisational 'discussion' of long term and large scale purpose could take place and become ongoing using means for defining and rationally considering the arguments yet to be developed. No such discussion could miss the issue of stagnation, or indeed the possible uses of engineered or temporary stagnant periods.\nWe are going to get there very, very soon!\n'At absolute zero, all chemical processes halt, entropy ceases to increase and time itself essentially stops.'\nAll chemical reactions may come to a halt but not entropy, atoms decay and so it goes on.\n1. Once the tardigrades are thawed out, what are they going to eat? Their continued existence depends on a compatible biology at the target star. It may even require a hospitable ecosystem all teh way down to the microbes and viruses.\n2. We cannot freeze humans down to nearly 0K. Unlike animals than that tolerate desiccation, our cells just freeze and burst. The result is the same as freezing and thawing bananas. You get mush. Now that may be solvable in the future as we are able to freeze small organs of experimental animals, so there may be hope eventually. However, since we are now closer to having artificial wombs, it may be easier to revert to sending frozen embryos, which we can do now, and find ways to bring up that first generation. But again, we have the alien biosphere to deal with unless we build habitats with local resources and keep the human descendants inside.\n3. The obvious technology to send intelligence to the stars already exists. They are called robots. They can easily stay in stasis for the long journey and \"boot up\" on arrival. They can operate on almost any world, living or dead. The \"only\" outstanding issue is how intelligent can they be? That we don't know, although I would bet that AGI to human level is achievable, even if that intelligence looks very different to human I.\n4. If humans do travel to the stars, I would expect robots to go well in advance to terraform worlds ready for human arrival. Their expansionary wave into teh galaxy will be perhaps 1 \u2013 10 millennia ahead of humans.\nRobert G August 2, 2017, 17:49\n(1\/2). Being tardigrades, they'd probably eat each other! Likely none of the cells of their regular foods have the same sort of disordered proteins or vitrifying sugars or whatever to survive being frozen down without ice crystals mushifying them from within.

{"text":" box then maybe they'd be happy with a leaf smoothy at the far end?\nI should have made myself a bit clearer here. The thought I had in mind writing that was not landing pioneering tardinauts to colonize a remote world; it was to point out that at least _part_ of the problem of biological space travel (getting some sort of complex organisms to a destination remote in space, alive) is solvable already for this special case, without needing to go down the speculative physics route.\nHumans cannot at present be frozen down, as you say, but if it is possible to do this to one sort of (just about!) macroscopic living thing, then perhaps we could coax ourselves into replicating the trick. Preventing water molecules from forming ordered ice crystals during freezing so that the cytoplasm cools into a disordered glass would constitute a big piece of the puzzle of cryogenic suspension. There are other pieces as well of course, but at least we have the example of tardigrades to show that we are not necessarily chasing the impossible. IIRC there are also some types of frogs that can survive being frozen solid, and they are much bigger than tardigrades!\nI think the alien biosphere issue you mention could actually be a showstopper for settling living worlds for reasons both technical and ethical.

Here we must imagine supercivilizations who do not have the patience to develop advanced transportation technologies, but which do have the patience to wait thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years, or hundreds of thousands of years, to exchange messages with another civilization.\"\nPrecisely. I understand why SETI have advocated transmitting over travelling: It is a combination of not wanting to be lumped in with the UFO crowd and the long-standing view that interstellar travel is very difficult \u2013 which it is, but not as impossible as once seemed. Paradigms will continue to change as we get smarter.\nI saw some of this bias in action in 2000, not so long ago. I was at a SETI conference at Harvard. The very first slide (on an overhead projector, no less) was a roughly hand drawn image of an overly complicated starship concept, an antimatter one at that. The panel of presenters used it to show just how tough, even absurd it was, to imagine even an advanced technological civilization trying to voyage across the galaxy. Signaling \u2013 via radio, of course \u2013 was much easier and cheaper.\nAnd that was it. The rest of the talk was on Radio SETI. Optical SETI might have had a mention or two, but back then it was just becoming acceptable by mainstream SETI long after being rejected following Charles Townes 1961 paper on the subject. The reasoning was that if humanity wasn't up to sending powerful laser messages across the stars, then ETI wouldn't either!\nThank goodness thinking is finally starting to change. The very recent launch of those StarChips predecessors, the Sprites, is even waking people up to the possibility that ETI could send very small probes to study other worlds, including us. The idea was brought up decades ago, but this is what happens when a field is dominated by just one specialty, in SETI's case radio astronomers.\nMust reading for those who want the real history of SETI:\nhttp:\/\/www.daviddarling.info\/encyclopedia\/S\/SETI_critical_history_cover.html\nRonald July 31, 2017, 9:30\nGreat essay again, Mr. Nielsen!\nAnd great comments, and I like following after Robert G., with whom I again fully agree, as in the previous METI discussion.\nI was somewhat saddened by all the 'impossibility of interstellar travel' talk, even by"}
{"text":" distinguished scientists, but I was encouraged by the mentioning of A.C. Clarke, because I was reminded of his 1st Law.

When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\n2) The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.\n3) Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\nFurther to Robert G. and the idea of some kind of hibernation\/cryonics as a solution for human interstellar travel, I can imagine a sort of 'intermediate' interstellar travel solution, in which not entire humans are sent, but human egg and sperm cells, or fertilized eggs (zygotes). Those are the absolute minimum to which a human being can be reduced, while still containing all the information.\nWe could think of even further reaching and more fantastic reductions, such as sending purely DNA codes, to be bio-assembled at destination, but there may not be much if any gain in this, and much unneccesarily added complexity and risk.

This may be extremely rare; what would happen if we surveyed the entire AC system and found lots of planets, with different kinds of life, yet nothing that could support humans?\nWe might assume that other \"civilizations\" would be constrained in similar fashion.\nIt's interesting to see an entomologist weigh in on this question."}
{"text":" Insect colonies could be regarded as another model of \"civilization\"; would interstellar technology be something to be evolved organically?\nIt would no doubt be a great stimulation to the human imagination and to our ambitions for exploration if we determined that a relatively nearby world had a biosphere. The likelihood of any biosphere in another planetary system being, \"almost identical in its life-supporting qualities as one's home world,\" is close to zero. Given the rate at which life speciates when separated on Earth (allopatric speciation), life separated across interstellar distances, even if related by distant panspermia, would have traveled a very different path. So the possibility of a biosphere that can support human life (without terraforming) is extremely low. Nevertheless, other biospheres would be of great scientific interest to us.\nCivilizations expand for all kinds of reasons, not just settlement: conquest, trade, intellectual curiosity, and proselytization, among them. Perhaps some of these motivations support an ongoing effort of significant magnitude better than others, and long lasting or expanding civilizations will be selected for the most effective motivations for projects of a cosmological scale.\nQuote by J. N. Nielsen: \"We may never get to the point when we can put quantum theory and general relativity together, and the technology to control gravity would remain beyond our ability.\" This is true only by the limitations of today's technology. I think that physicists will agree that it is a common misconception or opinion that we can't combine general relativity and quantum field theory. These have already been combined to a certain extent for example: the geodesics of the path of particles through space and time are already part of the equations of quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics etc.\nThe graviton has to be handled differently since the standard model is not background independent but general relativity is background independent. A quantum theory of gravity is not perturbatively renormalizable. The graviton, Wikipedia. We have discovered gravity waves which are a form of energy and any form of energy can be manipulated. A gravitational wave rocket would still be relativistic or subluminal. A warp drive needs negative energy density to work.\nScientific knowledge will never stagnate though at least not indefinitely since scientists will always look to build a better mousetrap or try and refine and make a technology more efficient. There could be both periods or cycles of stagnation and progress after breakthroughs but there will always be scientists and the need to break barriers and limitations. There will always be a scientists who think they can solve a technological problem since the archetype of Prometheus represents the creative mind, progress ingenuity and inventiveness and a scientific zeitgeist which isn't always opposed to an economic, material zeitgeist.\nChristopher Phoenix July 31, 2017, 23:24\nVery interesting article on civilizations on the grand scale of time and space\u2014stagnant civilizations that succeed in colonizing passing stars, but leave a very slight \"cosmic footprint\" are definitely food for thought.\nIt reminds me of John W. Campbell's The Black Star Passes\u2014which was the first appearance of this form of interstellar travel in SF. Actually it, is was also the last to my knowledge. Does anyone know if SF writers have used this kind of interstellar travel in fiction since?\nYes, interstellar travel is impossible for us, located in a diffusely populated arm of our spiral galaxy, but it might be possible for civilizations located in regions of the galaxy where stars are more closely spaced (such as galactic centers, globular clusters, or merely closely-packed regions of elliptical galaxies).\nPlaying devil's advocate here, I was given to understand that those densely packed regions of space where probably not the best locations for habitable planets and life? Passing stars can gravitationally disrupt planetary orbits, and in the galactic center, supernovae are quite common. Higher levels of radiation would be even more inconvenient for spacefarers who venture outside their home planet's protective atmosphere and magnetosphere. Stars in globular clusters tend to have low metallicity, as well.\nSome have gone so far as to suggest there is a \"Galactic Habitable Zone\" (GHZ) circumscribing the Milky Way at a fair distance from the center. Earth, naturally, is in this zone. If there really is a GHZ, civilizations will tend to form in regions similar to ours, with the stars fairly far away.\nI wasn't aware of the paper you cite on civilizations in globular clusters. It puts life in globulars in a different light, but I'm still wondering about the galactic center. A region densely packed with hot, short-lived O-type stars and frequent supernovae doesn't seem the healthiest place for civilizations to develop.\nIt has been a commonplace for some time that the centers of spiral galaxies are not good places for life or civilization. This is likely true, but it is also likely that there are regions within spiral galaxies where stars are more densely packed"}
{"text":" and conditions are reasonably favorable to life. The galaxy is a big place, and there are probably anomalous habitable zones hidden here and there.\nGlobular clusters are also not very amenable to life and civilization, as the processes of galactic ecology that occur in spiral and elliptical galaxies do not occur in globular clusters, so when R. Di Stefano and A. Ray published their paper they were definitely swimming against the tide. I don't think that civilizations are likely in globular clusters, but I certainly won't say that they are impossible.\nIf terrestrial civilization embodies the principle of mediocrity, that does not rule out the possibility of exceptional civilizations coming into existence in exceptional circumstances, but it does imply the unlikelihood of such civilizations. Thus if civilization is common in the universe, we would expect to see a distribution of civilizations with most occupying the bump in the bell curve of habitability, and fewer civilizations on each side of the bump. But if civilizations are rare, perhaps we only find them where conditions for life are just right, and unlikelihood is sufficient to prevent exceptional civilizations from evolving.\nole burde August 1, 2017, 15:46\nSmall groups of human beings have lived and thrived in isolated environments for thousands of years, even without a helping hand from modern technology.\nOn islands in the pacific Ocean and several other cut-off places, people have build smal self-sustaining comunities that would last until something broke the isolation.\nSo, why is it that this 'elefant in the room' is completely transparent to most people in this discussion? \u2026and even more so for the total deniers of space travel?\nThe stars can be reached in manny different ways, but the most simple and effective one is not to be mentioned\u2026..because it involves re-designing our selves and our social structures into something that can live with the same kind of hardship and suffering that our ancestors took as the natural way of things.\nDo you think they were more stupid than we are?\nThe REAL answer to the 'Seti-Paradigm' is to say aloud that people wil reach the stars No Matter What.\nPerhabs it will be on first class, but more likely it wil be on a 2000 year long voyage involving endless suffering which can only be endured while centering life around family, tradition and the hard work neccesary to keep the starship alive and well \u2026much like a tribe of cave-men surviving the ice age\nThe nuclear weapons tests of the 50's and 60's prove that inertial confinement fusion works when given enough scale. So a Daedalus type pulse fusion drive is a mere engineering challenge. You just need a big enough bucket with enough free electron lasers to fuse the pellets.\nSuch a craft would be expensive. But Lofstrom loops and orbital rings can give us access to all the planetary and sub planetary resources for us to grow in to. Centrifugal space habitats can provide many times the living space of Earth and make homes for a growing population of trillions.\nSo when exponential growth begins to exhaust all the construction materials available in the solar system it would make sense that at least some of them would groups would invest the resources to send there habitats and stockpiles of to another solar system so they can continue growing. People do care about the fate of their grand children but life extension would make such long term projects such as a generation ship even more attractive.\nOrbital rings and Lofstrom loops are more useful than space elevators and don't require new super materials to build I think it a shame the space elevator is the better known idea.\nA ground launched Orion drive produces less fall out than many of the other atmospheric nuclear tests. We could of built an interstellar ship half a century ago if we had wanted to.\nxcalibur August 2, 2017, 6:05\nSome of the best sci-fi novels I've read used stagnant super-civilization as a theme. Most notable is Asimov's Foundation trilogy, which describes the stagnation and gradual fall of a galaxy-wide empire, and the founding of a new society to shorten the interregnum. Dune addresses it more subtly, but it's there if you read through \u2014 the feudal system of Emperor\/Great Houses\/Guild\/CHOAM\/etc. is stagnant, and the \"Golden Path\" is about breaking this stagnation. The Scattering prevents humanity from being homogenized\/centralized, and there's a parallel between this and traveling to other stars in reality. God Emperor of Dune presents a vision in which \"hunter-seeker\" machines with self-improving AI would run rampant and exterminate our species, which was prevented by the aforementioned Golden Path. In any case, there are plenty of historical examples of stagnation to draw from, and I don't think future developments will eliminate that particular pitfall.\nGiven the speed of light, astronomical distances, and engineering requirements, space travel is difficult, but not impossible."}
{"text":" With better technology and infrastructure, it will come within our reach. 300 years ago, who would've believed that a man-made craft could fly around the world within a week? But with new technology, infrastructure and economy, it has become a reality. Likewise, there is no reason why interstellar flight and colonization cannot become a reality in the future. It is true that c imposes a hard limit, but I see this as positive, as it would prevent homogenization and enforce relative distance.\nI doubt we are the only instance of civilization. Given the huge number of galaxies, and potential solar systems within galaxies, it is probable that there is life and civilization out there, although it is hard to guess at its abundance. There may be an advanced civilization elsewhere in the Milky Way, perhaps on the opposite side of the core. As I've said on here before, there is no reason to assume that an alien civilization must be contemporary. It is possible that our first contact with ETI will be in the form of abandoned ruins and artifacts.\nljk August 2, 2017, 9:01\nAn Irish documentary about the incredible Voyager spacecraft is getting huge praise:\nhttp:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/the-farthest-movie-3518061-Jul2017\/\nBeyond the topic at hand, what's particularly striking about The Farthest is the number of women who worked on it. I ask Reynolds about this, and how it may tie into the recent moves by the Irish Film Board to address gender imbalance in Ireland's film industry.\n\"It's wonderful now to see, the change is so positive and it's so dynamic. And it's a real turning of the wheel, which I really applaud,\" says Reynolds of the deliberate steps to bring about gender parity. Over the years she worked as a film editor, just a \"minuscule fraction\" of the directors she worked with were women.\n\"Encouraging women into key positions is fantastic for everyone,\" she says. The film itself reflects that.\n\"We took it as read that women's voices would be loud and proud in it,\" says Reynolds. This also reflects the growth in acknowledgement of women's role in scientific discoveries, such as the film Hidden Figures.\nAfter the documentary was shown at the Audi Dublin International Film Festival, Reynolds got three letters from young girls (two aged 10 and one aged 12) telling her they want to be scientists.\n\"I was like,'my work is done',\" says Reynolds. \"That was the thrill of a lifetime, for me to inspire them.\"\n'It's a romantic attempt to describe how we are as humans to an extra-terrestrial audience'\nEmer Reynolds's new film 'The Farthest' looks at the extraordinary, humbling story the Voyager space project.\nhttp:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/culture\/film\/it-s-a-romantic-attempt-to-describe-how-we-are-as-humans-to-an-extra-terrestrial-audience-1.3165339\nInterestingly, the Voyager crew have mixed feelings about the famous \"golden record\" that each craft carries. This is a gold-plated copper LP, packed with a needle, cartridge and instructions, and containing, in groove form, photos from Earth, a selection of natural sounds, plus music from a variety of cultures and eras. Tracks include Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode, Glenn Gould performing from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, and a pygmy girl's initiation song from Zaire.\nCarl Sagan, the project supervisor and astrophysicist, had wanted to include The Beatles' Here Comes the Sun, but EMI turned him down, saying \"We don't licence for outer space.\" There are, additionally, spoken greetings in 55 languages, including such ancient dialects as Akkadian and Hittite. The Amoy message asks: \"Friends of space, how are you all? Have you eaten yet? Come visit us if you have time.\" Nick Sagan, the Star Trek writer and son of Carl Sagan, recorded the English message as a child: \"Hello from the children of planet Earth.\"\n\"I think one of the great things about Voyager is that it just naturally has these two pieces to it,\" says Reynolds. \"The heart and the mind. It combines extraordinary scientific discoveries and achievement with this romantic attempt to describe how we are as humans to an extra-terrestrial audience. This little craft built in the 1970s is knocking it out of the park in terms of science. But it also has this amazing golden record attached to the outside of the craft which is insane that is trying to communicate with aliens. It has everything we are as people.\"\ndavid lewis August 2, 2017, 10:51\nIf a civilization uploads itself into a computer, could it be called stagnant?

{"text":" would mean doing anything in the real world would take a near eternity. Would such a people even bother with reality?\nAs for exploration, even travelling a mere 3 milimeters would take a billion years of simulated time, though zero time for the traveller. Would a person interested in exploration bother looking outside the simulation when they got a near infinite number of worlds and people to explore that doesn't risk their death? Even that short distance of 3 milimeters means they could never return to their own civilization which would have been dust for billions of years.\nThey might never get beyond their own homeworld, but trillions of civilization, each with population greater than that of a whole galaxy of dyson swarms, could rise and fall within such a simulation every day.\nOnce again, this is a lot like John Smart's transcension hypothesis, which I mentioned above in my response to Dimjo's comment (above). Why would any civilization choose to do things in the real world when virtual worlds could be scaled in the way you suggest?\nThis is an interesting position, but I don't think it's the final word. Ultimately, this is a question about the ongoing relevance of human life as we know it. I haven't yet addressed this in a systematic way. I believe that human beings will remain relevant to terrestrial civilization for a long time to come, but I won't try to make the argument here.\nSome things to consider:\n1. We don't know that consciousness can scale in virtual environments. I.e., you might not be able to advance the clock speed much beyond that of the human nervous system and still have consciousness function as it does. There may be other forms of awareness, distinct from human consciousness, which can be scaled in virtual environments, but we can't test this idea until we have virtual environments consisting of multiple instances of consciousness.\n2. If a civilization should focus on virtuality but remain tightly-coupled to its homeworld, it is subject to existential risks that it would be able to mitigate by distributing itself more widely in the non-virtual world. Even something as powerful as a matrioshka brain couldn't protect itself from cosmological scale accidents if it exists in one place only. Also, something like this would not survive its host star growing into a red giant.\n3. An ideal virtual environment with \"a near infinite number of worlds and people to explore that doesn't risk their death\" would become boring after a while. If there are no real world consequences of one's actions, these actions come to be seen in a different light. I addressed this above in my discussion of the pursuit of \"limit experiences.\" It would be a fun exercise (perhaps this could be the basis of a future post on the simulation hypothesis, the transcension hypothesis, and related ideas) to compare these virtual world exercises and their presumed outcomes to what Nietzsche called the \"Last Men.\" (For the time being you can see what I wrote about the \"Last Civilization.\" https:\/\/geopolicraticus.wordpress.com\/2011\/02\/10\/the-last-civilization\/)\nA couple of interesting scenario's occurred to me recently.\nIf a species responds on average slightly more aggressively to the prisoners dilemma, they may not be able to last more than a couple of decades nuclear stand off. But if you have nukes you can also build interstellar ships with Orion Drive so being more cavalier with radiation their space race involved ground launching Orion Drive powered generation ships as insurance before destroying most of their industry in nuclear war. They have enough tools on their generation ships to build habitats and other generation ships from asteroids but their fear of mutually assured destruction lead to rival factions always fleeing or destroying each over. So they they never get the economies of scale required for true microchip fabrication, for them it is forever the 60's. This is an almost plausible way to have the sci-fi trope of a defeatable alien invader if you postulate that modern human civilisation only came out of the Cold War without it going hot was because humans are irrationally and exceptionally optimistic in prisoner's dilemma situations. Maybe even plausibly have some scattered remains of a brief stay in our asteroid belt before rival factions destroyed each other with any survivors fleeing. Remember an Orion drive can always double as a nuclear machine gun.\nAnother is that if a new understanding of the \"EM Drive\" anomaly produced a cheap and easy to manufacture warp drive. Then when everyone's car can fly round the world within an hour, everyone has a delivery vehicle faster and more manueverable than a balistic missile.

Also being able to apply the results of scientific maturity to to implementable technologies is another matter. However, it occurs to me only now as I write this that a civilization that must push the limits in order to keep its most advanced science testable would also be a civilization developing new technologies capable of such testing.

{"text":"ESG Integration into the Business Model\nSubjects: Business, Finance\nAlaa Aldowaish\nThe integration of ESG into the business model means considering ESG issues in the existing business model, which is defined by four factors: value proposition, value creation, value delivery, and value capture.\nESG integration\nsocially responsible investment\nSince its introduction by the United Nations in 2004 [1], environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration has been considered one of the latest and most widely adopted sustainability yardsticks worldwide [2]. The pressure from official regulations, investors, and stakeholders on firms to disclose their ESG performance has impacted company attitudes toward sustainability. This has led to issues such as the manipulation of firms' ESG performance and the emergence of notions such as greenwashing, value washing, and blue washing, aimed to attract funds and satisfy stakeholders. Greenwashing refers to the manipulation of sustainability reporting [3], value washing relates to the misrepresentation of value outcomes [4], and blue washing alludes to unethical behaviors in using the United Nations Compact for gaining legitimacy [5].\nTwo views of ESG integration exist in the literature. The first view is that of socially responsible investment (SRI), which discusses ESG from the perspective of investment; and the second view has evolved from sustainable development (SD) and considers ESG from the perspective of firms' operations. However, to date, while the literature has focused extensively on examining ESG integration from the viewpoint of SRI, there has been little discussion of the integration of ESG factors into core business operations.\nThus, while an increasing number of firms are adopting ESG compliance, there remains a paucity of knowledge regarding the impact of ESG on the business model, which is required to address the sustainability of firms and society.\nThis review presents two critical views of the literature, conceptualizing the relationship between ESG and the business model. We examined the impact of ESG on business model outcomes and on the process of integration.\nThe results show the need for more research on the integration process to explain how it occurs in different contexts and provide guidelines on how to integrate it into the present business model. This should also address integration issues, such as the lack of ESG standardization [6].\nThe main practical implication is that unless the world gives serious consideration to the integration of ESG into the business model, the current promotion of ESG may turn out to have been unfounded.\n2. ESG Integration: Socially Responsible Investment\nConcerns about the environment have raised global awareness of sustainability issues, thereby shifting traditional investments directed toward profit maximization to those that support sustainability. The current tendency of the integration of sustainability and ESG in the financial market is termed SRI [7][8]. SRI refers to ESG integration based on an explicit and systematic consideration of environmental, social, and governance factors in the investment decision-making process [2]. The definition of ESG can be broken down in terms of three factors. Environmental factors consider how a company performs as a steward of the natural environment. Social factors examine how a company manages its relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which it operates. Governance factors include a company's leadership, executive pay, internal controls, audits, and shareholder rights. These factors are used as a set of standards to assess a company's operations when screening for investments [9].\nEmpirical research shows that the effects of ESG on financial markets, as represented in firms' financial performance and value, are being debated in terms of both positive and negative impacts. A study of more than 2000 empirical findings revealed that most ESG research findings indicate a positive impact of ESG on firms' corporate financial performance [10]. In addition, a positive relationship was found between ESG disclosure and profitability in European firms [11]. A survey of empirical research in accounting and finance literature spanning 45 years also found a positive link between ESG and financial performance [12]. However, other findings indicate a negative impact of ESG on financial performance [13][14].\nMost of the literature provides mixed signals regarding the positive and negative market values of ESG reporting. One author argues that a socially responsible market leads to an increased number of stakeholders [15]. Others find a negative impact on market value and recommend improving report quality to mitigate this [16]. Investors play an essential role in supporting ESG and ethical practices, which is reflected in the literature in terms of the investor-based integration of ESG in decision-making [17], the process of investing in managing risks [18], and improvements to the investment process [19]. However, research has also identified negative effects of investor integration of ESG, such as lack of consideration of the core issues that drive business models and finance [20], the lack of a business case, poor quality of data, and the absence of clear standards and definitions [21].\nThere are references to the manager-based integration of ESG into investment strategies at different levels, ranging"}
{"text":" from full integration to low integration [22], and using ESG reporting for reducing risk rather than for maximizing value [23].\n3. ESG Integration into Firms: Sustainable Development\nThe integration of sustainability and ESG into firm operations is referred to as SD. SD has been defined in corporate activities as balancing current sustainability with economic, environmental, and social aspects while also addressing company systems, such as operations and production, the organizational system, governance, assessment, and communication [24].\nFew empirical studies have examined the impact of ESG on firm operations. The discussion is mostly limited to the positive impact of strategies that consider ESG performance [25], as well as corporate governance and ESG reporting [26][27][28][29]. A positive impact of regulation on reporting strategies and governance practices is noted in firms becoming proactive in addressing sustainability through communication, transparency, stakeholder engagement, and the improvement of relationships with external resources [30].\nHowever, ESG as an indicator of sustainability is criticized for not showing the position of firms with regard to the sustainability and trustworthiness of ESG data [31]. Figure 1 illustrates ESG integration in the literature in terms of both investment and internal operations.\nFigure 1. ESG integration literature.\n4. Findings: ESG integration into the business model\nWe found only 29 studies related to this ESG integration into the business model. Including 27 papers conceptualized ESG into the business model as an outcome; they included 10 papers along the lines of SRI, 16 papers following the view of SD, and 1 paper that addressed both SRI and SD. The papers provided only a general conception of the relationship between ESG and business models with no details of how the integration actually occurred. We grouped similar integration outcomes into four dimensions: (1) integration behaviors of ESG, in which the literature discusses the impact of government regulations, investors, and banks on integration behavior; (2) the advantages of ESG integration for firms and investors; (3) ESG practices, such as an examination of current cases addressing ESG in the business model; and (4) critical views of ESG in the business model.\nOf the remaining two papers, the first examined the integration process based on the SRI view, while the second paper addressed the integration in terms of SD. The latter dealt with a firm integrating the concepts of sustainability and circular economy into its business model through value proposition, value delivery, value creation, and value capture.\nFigure 2. Paper analysis results of ESG integration process and outcomes.\nThe literature provides only a conceptual understanding of the relationship between ESG and business models. There is neither an actual detailed case of the integration process nor an explanation of how firms can fully integrate ESG, transform, or improve their business model to resolve trade-offs [32], and enforce profit and sustainability. Moreover, there has been no discussion of ESG integration into core business models. Our results suggest that the pressure to integrate ESG leads to reluctant ESG adoption without a holistic integration of ESG into the business model. We state the need for more research into the integration process to motivate firms to reform their business models, foster sustainability, and enhance financial performance.\nThis entry is adapted from 10.3390\/su14052959\nEccles, R.; Stroehle, J.

Please add your name to the public letter at www.renewourworld.net.\nFive Anglican Archbishops from three continents, speaking on behalf of the 85 million-member Anglican Communion, branded climate change 'the challenge of our generation.'\nAlso the award-winning human rights activist Dr Denis Mukwege joined dozens of other Christian leaders in a public letter urging global leaders to turn the Paris Climate Agreement into action when they meet next month. Dr Mukwege, who is known for his medical treatment and advocacy on behalf of women who have been gang-raped by rebel forces in eastern D.R.Congo, said that he is\nconvinced that climate change has the biggest impact on the most vulnerable. The related competition for natural resources, especially agricultural land, it is a key driver of violent conflicts. Women often bear the brunt of this violence. Christians must bear their responsibility to speak out against this injustice.\nDr Denis Mukwege speaking at an EU-CORD event in October 2017 in Brussels. Photo credit: Bruno Mariani.\nThe letter is launched by Renew Our World campaign, a global community of Christians speaking out for justice, which EU-CORD is part of.\nThe COP23 global climate talks will take place November 6 to 17, convening hundreds of government leaders to take action towards the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nIn the letter, church leaders urge national governments 'to keep the promises they made in the Paris Agreement, to restore the natural balance,' and to ensure that global warming is limited to the safe level of 1.5 degrees to protect the poorest people worldwide, who are hit the hardest by climate change. It also calls for more investment in clean off-grid energy to reach those in poverty who can't access national electricity sources.\nAt EU-CORD we are convinced that there is a growing demand for stronger action to tackle climate change.\nChristians across the world are joining the Renew Our World campaign to urge political leaders to agree ambitious targets and outline substantial plans for how they will cut their emissions and carbon use. In their every day work, EU-CORD members see the effects climate change is having on the poorest people in the world, dragging many back into the clutches of poverty through floods, droughts, and bad harvests.\nThe open letter says that Christian leadership on climate change is 'a significant part of how we love our neighbours.'\nWe're committing to respond as Christians by living more sustainably, praying, and raising our voices; we're asking every member of the church \u2013 the world's largest network \u2013 to join in, alongside many others, and every national leader to lead the way.\nThe letter is also signed by Bishop Efraim Tendero from the Philippines, Secretary General of the World Evangelical Alliance, the well known climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, 24\/7 Prayer movement leader Pete Greig, and the US American Christian singer Nichole Nordeman. Among the European initial signers are Dr Robert Innes, Bishop of the Anglican Diocese in Europe, Evi Rodemann from the Lausanne Movement, and Thomas Bucher, the General Secretary of the European Evangelical Alliance.\nMore information can be found at www.renewourworld.net.\nInfluencing Change (28)\nMobilising Resources (6)\nSharing Knowledge (13)\nFaith actors call for Global Solidarity\nEU-CORD joins PaRD\nHelp a Child \u2013 Protection Power\nWhat's religion go to do with it?\nThis is a rubbish campaign\nEU-CORD\nRue de l'Arbre B\u00e9nit\/Gewijde-Boomstraat 44 Bte 6, 1050 Brussels, Belgium\ninfo@eu-cord.org\nhttps:\/\/www.eu-cord.org\nRT @HI_Advocacy : 15% of world population lives with a disability, yet in many countries persons with disabilities are excluded from the lab\u2026\t1 month ago\nRT @BlandineBouniol : Francois Carbonez presents @iddcconsortium reco to #LeaveNoOneBehind at @BtG_project conf"}

This is a sad thing in a fast developing world like ours. In Nigeria, only about 30% of the population has access to electricity and even this is not stable. Solar energy provides us with an alternative source of light.\nThere is solar energy which is environmentally safe but also safe for the household but many find it rather expensive. Many fire incidents in homes come from the use of kerosene, generators and candles. It is interesting to know however that study has shown that those who use solar products spend even less than those who make use of kerosene, candles and fuel.\nMonthly spending on a generator is shown to cost more than that used on a solar product.

{"text":"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and social good have often been viewed as strategies for global enterprises to undertake. Rarely is the concept attributed to small businesses, perhaps because of the perceived cost or the idea that it has to be a big effort or it won't actually change the world.\nHowever, what is working is when more businesses of any size take small steps and implement even the most minor changes to how they work or how they view their overall goals. It is in these smaller actions that big shifts can be made that will start addressing some of the larger social issues.\n1. Educate and create awareness among your target audience and customer base.\nMost people are searching for information that they can use to benefit their own lives or do what they can do to live more responsibly. This is especially true with the millennial demographic who want to feel like they are doing things that really matter in life and have a purpose in relation to the world around them.\nTo do this, focus on those issues you feel passionate about and where you feel like you can add knowledge and experience that would be useful for your audience. Once you have the topics, then create content around those issues that you can post on your social media sites, blog, email newsletters or other channels where you know your audience engages with your business.\nThe best format to use tends to be video content followed by other visuals like case studies with pictures and infographics. However, regular content, if formatted in a way that offers easy-to-spot takeaways, also works.\n2. Find ways to partner with local government and community groups to innovate.\nThere is a new CSR movement among startups and entrepreneurs that has focused on working with local, regional, and national government agencies to help with critical social issues through innovation and technology. This movement can be championed by small businesses who work in partnership with local government organizations on committees, programs, and projects that develop job creation programs, tackle environmental issues, and even address other social ills like homelessness. Additionally, these partnerships are leading to new initiatives and even apps that are helping add efficiencies and improve the quality of life for citizens. Plus, many of these projects in your local city may actually provide additional revenue in addition to helping you tackle more positive social initiatives.\nTo get involved, find out what your local city is working on and identify gaps where skills and knowledge could be useful to these government agencies. Discover what types of projects and vendors are currently working on specific social and govtech projects by looking on your city government website. By contacting those vendors directly, you may have a better chance of getting directly involved in working on that social project and helping your local community make your corner of the world a much better place to live and work.\n3. Donate your time and expertise in areas of need.\nWhile you may not have a lot of money to donate to a cause or social problem, your time can be just as valuable a resource for local organizations. For example, you can micro-mentor, which involves advising another small business to help them develop and become a positive economic force in your community.\nOther ideas include sharing your expertise online by answering questions on sites like Quora or Career Village. These online platforms enable you to help others in a way that fits your busy schedule. SCORE hosts the online community called PartnerUp that helps small business owners and entrepreneurs, so you can also answer questions and direct others like you on strategy and the right approach to issues they face.\nThen, there are numerous other organizations to join in that can be local or farther afield, including many volunteer opportunities that you can tap into online. For example, Goodwill helps people re-enter the workforce. Junior Achievement is a not-for-profit organization that allows you to work with young people to inspire them toward entrepreneurial success. Look for other opportunities on sites like VolunteerMatch.\nWith so many options, you can find those opportunities that align with your interests, passion, and knowledge, as well as fit into your schedule.\nDon't feel compelled to take on saving the world overnight. Instead, start with a small project or volunteer assignment and see how you can increase your efforts over time. Anything you can do to focus on improving the world will make a difference. Work toward solving a social issue and encourage others to get involved. In the process, you will most likely increase your happiness in life knowing you are helping others."}

But only about 8,000 of these deaths are from the outdoor pollution that we normally worry about, particularly in cities. 7,000 result from household air pollution, caused by cooking and heating with wood and other solid fuels. This affects mainly rural communities.\nIn both cities and countryside, the cause is the same: tiny particles in smoke which we breathe in and which can lead to chronic lung disease and acute respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease and strokes. This does not just affect Latin America, but is a global problem causing over 6 million deaths worldwide each year.[ii]\nIn Colombia, outdoor air pollution is a real problem, causing about one in 20 of all deaths in the metropolitan areas of Bogota, Valle de Aburra and Cali. But for rural dwellers the situation is much worse; household air pollution is responsible for an alarming 17% of all deaths. More than one in every six deaths is caused by burning wood and solid fuels to cook food and keep warm.\nThe most dangerous of the airborne particle are known as PM2.5 (particulates less than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre across) which can penetrate deep into the lung. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a limit for average outdoor ambient air pollution of 10 micrograms (10 millionth of a gram) of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air (10 \u00b5g\/m3). In urban areas, the level may be twice this, and over 60% of the Colombian population is estimated to breathe air which is more polluted than the WHO guideline[iii].\n6 million Colombians \u2013 half of all rural households \u2013 rely on solid fuels and many others use them as part of their fuel mix. For these households, mainly in the Caribe, Central and Pacifica regions, air pollution is often at least ten times higher than in towns and cities. For the person cooking, average concentrations of PM2.5 breathed day and night are in the range of 11 to 26 times the WHO guideline, a really shocking statistic.\nReplacing open fires and traditional stoves with improved cookstoves with chimneys \u2013 and maintaining them well - reduces this exposure by half, but the average remains about 80\u00b5g\/m3, still eight times the recommended limit. To make greater improvements, households need to make the transition to the more expensive propane (LPG). Use of gas as the primary fuel is a key reason why urban households are less polluted. If all rural households used LPG, pollution may decline to 25\u00b5g\/m3 or less, but exposure would be perhaps double that if only a fraction of households changed.\nAdoption of improved cookstoves would reduce the risk of disease and death by 30%. Going further and using LPG would reduce disease and death by 45-65%.\nImproved cookstoves in Colombia are relatively expensive but there is no reason why they should not be modelled on the successful examples of Mexico, Peru, Guatemala and other countries in the region[iv]. Costs there are in the region of 250-400 thousand Pesos, and they burn only about half the amount of wood used in traditional stoves, so there are savings on fuel costs. On the other hand LPG stoves can cost half a million Pesos, and the fuel can cost a further 350 thousand Pesos a year. For both cases, the benefits in health, fuel savings and time more than outweigh the cost.\nBut the transition to use of gas cannot happen overnight because not all families can afford the cost. A reasonable interim target is to convert half of the households burning solid fuel to improved stoves with a chimney and the other half to LPG stoves. This would reduce the incidence of death and illness by over a third and save 2,750 lives a year. Every thousand Pesos spent on improved stoves would pay back 9,000 Pesos in benefits, while a thousand Pesos spent on LPG stoves would give benefits worth at least 2,500 Pesos. Both would make a real improvement to people's lives.\nConverting all households to LPG would save 4,700 deaths a year and reduce disease and death by two thirds. The annual cost would be 673 billion Pesos, but the"}

However, achieving this would be far more expensive than investing in cleaner cooking facilities for rural households. In doing this, it is important to involve whole communities so that pollution is reduced for all households.\n[i] Larsen, B., and Skjelvik, J.M. 2014.

[34471\/19]\nWritten answers (Question to Communications)\nMinister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment\nThe European Electronic Communications Code, Directive (EU) 2018\/1972, is a cornerstone piece of legislation in the European Digital Single Market programme. It aims to recast the legislative framework underpinning the electronic communications sector throughout the Union and make it fit for the digital age. The Directive consists of over 100 Articles and over 300 Recitals and its transposition will be a complex process. Officials in my Department are working on the transposition of this important file. An internal Steering Group has been established to oversee the planning and drafting of the transposition and a detailed project plan has been agreed. In addition, my Department is engaging with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, industry representatives and other key stakeholders, as appropriate, to ensure the transposition is completed to the highest standard.\nCyber Security Policy\nQuestion No. 2297 answered with Question No. 2184.\n2296. Deputy Sean Sherlock asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the resources available to the National Cybersecurity Centre; and when he last met with officials from the centre on its resourcing needs. [34472\/19]\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is located within my Department, and is the primary cyber security authority in the State. The Centre has a number of roles, and is responsible for acting as a conduit for information to constituents, including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, Government Departments and Agencies. The Centre also provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and is involved in coordinating the response to significant incidents. The Centre also acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State, and has a number of formal roles in the protection of Critical National Infrastructure, including those under the EU Network and Information Security Directive, which was transposed in September 2018. I meet with the senior officials with responsibility for Cyber Security regularly.\nThe NCSC is composed of highly skilled, specialist technical civilian staff, with skillsets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cyber security compliance, as well as general cyber security skills. In terms of resources, additional funding has been secured for a substantial enlargement of the NCSC both in terms of personnel and additional technology in order to address the responsibilities placed upon the State by the Network and Information Security Directive. The annual allocation of the National Cyber Security Centre in 2019 is now \u20ac4,000,000, and staffing levels have increased significantly in recent years. My Department is also finalising a new National Cyber Security Strategy, which will set out the measures that Government will take to meet future challenges in cyber security.\nDavid Cullinane\n2298. Deputy David Cullinane asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the strategies and policies in place to address light pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34508\/19]\nThere is currently no legislation in Ireland dealing specifically with environmental light pollution, and my Department has no role in this regard. I am advised that the amount of light that might emanate from a proposed development in terms of potential impacts on adjoining properties and protecting their residential amenity is considered in assessing individual planning applications on a case by case basis. However there is no specific national strategy in place in relation to 'light pollution' under planning or environmental legislation.\n2299. Deputy David Cullinane asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the strategies and policies in place to address noise pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34509\/19]\nThe European Communities (Environmental Noise) Regulations 2018 (S. I. No 549 of 2018) transpose EU Directive 2002\/49\/EC4 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise. The Directive aims to provide a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise. For the purposes of these Regulations, environmental noise means unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport and from sites of industrial activity. The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large agglomerations, major roads, railways and airports. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.\nThe Regulations assign primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning to local authorities. While a number of other"}
{"text":" bodies also have noise mapping functions, they will be carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned. The Regulations designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations. The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive. Further information on strategic noise maps and action plans is available at the following link: EPA https:\/\/gis.epa.ie\/EPAMaps\/\nThe Regulations provide for strategic noise maps and action plans to be made available to the general public for consultation and I would encourage the public to participate in this consultation process.\nR\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall\n2300. Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the arrangements for monitoring air quality in the vicinity of the entrance and exit of the Dublin Port tunnel in Santry, Dublin 9; if this data is publicly available; the action which will be taken now in view of the recent Environmental Protection Agency report highlighting high levels of nitrogen dioxide at the location; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34510\/19]\nA report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recently released, indicates that areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area may have higher levels of the pollutant Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) than previously indicated. The NO2 levels indicated at the entrance and exit to the Port Tunnel by the report are based on modelling rather than monitoring, and I am not aware of any current monitoring at the location. Ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008\/50\/EC) and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004\/107\/EC of 15 December 2004). These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.\nThere are a number of monitoring stations across North Dublin in the national monitoring network, including stations at Finglas, Marino and St Anne's Park. Data from these stations is available on the Environmental Protection Agency's website at http:\/\/www.epa.ie\/air\/quality\/data\/\nThe EPA report underlines the need to implement the Climate Action Plan. The Plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing harmful emissions and improving air quality. My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have begun discussions on establishing a working group, bringing relevant organisations together to ensure early action is taken on this matter and to improve the air quality in Dublin. This process will include the two Departments, the four Dublin Local Authorities and the EPA.\nThis work will complement the work already underway in developing a Clean Air Strategy, which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national priorities, and EU and other international policy considerations. The Clean Air Strategy will address a range of harmful air pollutants in Ireland, including those arising from the agricultural, transport and residential heating sectors, in an integrated manner. I intend to publish the Strategy in the coming months.\nBetter Energy Homes Scheme Eligibility\n2301. Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the reason for continuing to exclude low-income pensioners from support for externally insulating their homes under the better energy warmer homes scheme on the grounds that they had earlier had their attic insulated under the scheme; the further reason in view of the fact that external insulation was not included in the scheme when the earlier work was done; if he will amend the terms of the scheme to enable pensioners in this situation to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and achieve energy savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34514\/19]\nThe Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the"}
{"text":" energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve and will also enable future fuel switching.\nDemand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI's contractor panel.\nBetter Energy Homes Scheme Data\nQuestions (2302, 2303)\nAindrias Moynihan\n2302. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the number of houses each service provider has deep retrofitted under the better energy homes programme, the warmth and well-being or warmer homes schemes to date in 2019, in tabular form; the number of homes expected to be completed by the end of 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34538\/19]\n2303. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the level of funding available in 2019 to deep retrofit homes under the better energy homes programme, the warmth and well-being or warmer homes schemes; the number of homes planned to deep retrofit in 2019; the level of funding committed already to date; if he is satisfied the available funding will be adequate to maintain the schemes to the end of 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34539\/19]\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 2302 and 2303 together.\nThe Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers a range of energy efficiency retrofit schemes, including those referenced by the Deputy, on behalf of my Department.\nThe Better Energy Homes Scheme provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes. The financial allocation for this scheme is \u20ac21 million for 2019 with approximately \u20ac11 million spent to date and a further \u20ac4 million committed. Better Energy Homes is a demand-led programme and SEAI estimate that approximately 14,000 homeowners will receive grants this year towards energy efficiency upgrade works (both shallow and deeper).\nThe Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The initial Warmer Homes Scheme budget allocation for 2019 was \u20ac24m. However, following a mid-year capital review conducted by my Department and SEAI recently, the budget has been increased to \u20ac39.8m for 2019 to address program needs. The total number of homes upgraded to date in 2019 under the Scheme is 2,241. The SEAI estimate that approximately 4,500 homes (both shallow and deeper interventions) will be upgraded under the Scheme by end of 2019.\nThe Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme aims to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition. The budget allocation for the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme is \u20ac7m with a total of 276 homes upgraded under the Scheme to date in 2019. The SEAI estimate that up to 400 homes in total will be upgraded under the Warmth & Wellbeing Scheme for the full-year 2019.\nOfficials in my Department have been informed by SEAI that the information requested by the Deputy on individual service providers is commercially sensitive. However, anonymised activity data is set out in the following tables. It is important to note that many factors affect the number of homes a given contractor delivers such as their contract, capacity, their quality of work, and their deeper retrofit experience.\nTable 1: Better Energy Homes Contractor Allocations 2019 (year to date)*\nBetter Energy\nHomes Contractor\nNo. of Homes Completed\nContractor 10\n*Over 500 contractors are registered for the Better Energy Homes Scheme.

Deputy Aindrias Moynihan asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the number of premises nationally which are not connected to high speed broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34561\/19]\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 2304 to 2309, inclusive, together.\nEvery home, farm, school and business in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband \u2013 no matter where they are located \u2013 following the Government's decision on 7th May this year to approve the appointment of a preferred bidder to the National Broadband Plan. Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.\nThe NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 75% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.\nThe High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.\nThe Map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode.\nThe AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP.\nThe BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.\nThe LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with the Department in April 2017 and available on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie\nThe following table outlines the number of premises where access to a high speed broadband connection is, or will be, delivered by commercial operators (BLUE\/LIGHT BLUE) and those where access to this vital service will be delivered under the State led intervention (AMBER).\nCounty Name\nPremises within the NBP State Intervention Area\nPremises within Commercial Operator's Area\nPremises within eir's commercial rural deployment\n187,835 (69%)\n7,534 (3%)\nNorth West Cork\n1,782,517 (75%)\n58,131 (2%)\nInformation on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county is available on my Department's website at http:\/\/www.dccae.gov.ie\/communications\/en-ie\/Broadband\/Pages\/County-and-Townland-Maps.aspx.\nUnder a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to data for Q1 2019 the company has passed almost 250,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. According to information provided by eir to my Department, it plans to complete the vast majority of the deployment by the mid-year completion target with the remaining premises to be completed soon afterwards.\nThe Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder subject to contract close and the finalisation of financial and legal requirements; this work is progressing. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after contract close.\nThe Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.\nA deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations.\nThe Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.\nDepartmental Communications\nShane Cassells\n2310.

[34608\/19]\nMy Department's remit includes complex policy areas, oversight of State regulation and service provision across key strategic sectors such as climate action, waste management, energy and public broadcasting, and regulation of sectors such as mining and hydrocarbon exploration. Given the technical complexity, economic significance and community interest in these areas, there is a requirement to disseminate information and to address specific issues as they arise. The Department therefore necessarily incurs some expenditure on social media advertising and online promoted material on these from time to time.

Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the extent to which he remains satisfied that carbon emissions throughout the EU are measured equally with a view to ensuring that the more developed countries in the EU do not have the advantage over expanding economies such as Ireland with a view to an evenly spread advantage or disadvantage throughout the EU and noting in particular the relatively low rate of heavy carbon emitting industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34646\/19]\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepares inventories of past, and projections of future, greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland on an annual basis. Inventories and projections are compiled by the EPA according to international standards to meet EU and UN reporting obligations and to inform national policy development. The EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which entered into force on 9 July 2018, sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland's target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of non-ETS emissions by 2030.\nTargets for Member States were established based on a range of criteria, including GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within each Member State. During the Effort Sharing Regulation negotiations, Ireland emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion aimed at retaining a high environmental ambition for the EU, but also providing each Member State with the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner. I am satisfied that the Regulation provides appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances, and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.\nThe recently published Climate Action Plan 2019 sets out for the first time how Ireland will reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan sets out, in Chapter 3, the expected emissions abatement contribution from existing commitments under Project Ireland 2040 and from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) measures. The Plan includes the necessary targets and measures, supported by detailed actions and roadmaps, to close the identified remaining gap of 58.4 MtCO2eq in the non-ETS sector. The relevant table is reproduced below.\nCarbon Budget\nCompliance Gap\nEffort Sharing Regulation (ESR) Ceiling\n378.3 Mt\nProjected Emissions (Pre-NDP)\nContribution of Project Ireland 2040 NDP Measures\n- 16.4 Mt\n85.2 Mt\nContribution of LULUCF\nAdditional Abatement Effort Required\nIreland supports strong EU ambition in order to contribute to the Paris Agreement objectives. The Climate Action Plan confirms Ireland's support for increased EU climate ambition and the adoption of a net zero target by 2050 at EU level, including in the context of the importance of the EU reaffirming its role as a global leader in relation to ambitious climate action, and also in view of the upcoming UN Climate Summit in September 2019.\nThe transition to climate neutral economy will present both challenges and opportunities, and require additional changes across all sectors of the economy. Under the new Climate Action Plan I have committed to evaluate in detail the changes that would be necessary in pursuit of this objective at a national level.\nUnder the Plan, I have also committed to bring forward a new Climate Action (Amendment) Bill which will make the adoption of carbon budgets a legal requirement, require the Government to set a decarbonisation target range for each sector over five year periods, and establish a 2050 target in law.\nClimate Change Policy\n2312. Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment his views on whether the afforestation, the use of bog lands carbon repositories and wind generated electricity"}
{"text":" can each contribute to carbon reduction with a view to improving the progress in line with international agreements; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [34647\/19]\nThe recently published Climate Action Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan confirms that afforestation will have a key role to play in delivering emissions reductions and helping Ireland to achieve its 2030 targets. It commits, under Action 116, to implementing the Forest Programme 2014-2020 in line with the Mid-Term Review recommendations and targets an average annual afforestation rate of 8,000 hectares per annum of newly planted forest, as well as sustainable forest management of existing forests.\nBetter management of peatlands and soils under Actions 131 to 134 in the Plan will support the protection and enhancement of the carbon sink function of peatland landscapes, including through assessment and implementation mitigation options on post-production, peat extraction sites, and the implementation of measures for peatlands conservation.\nTo meet the required level of emissions reduction, the Plan sets a target of increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% by 2030, indicatively comprised as follows:\n- at least 3.5 GW of offshore renewable energy\n- up to 1.5 GW of grid-scale solar energy\n- up to 8.2 GW total of increased onshore wind capacity\nThe Plan includes a number of actions to deliver this target, including regulatory streamlining of renewables and grid development; development of the offshore renewables sector, implementation of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme; and development of an enabling framework for micro-generation.\nMichael Healy-Rae\n2313. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the steps he is taking to reduce automotive emissions of State cars (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. [31877\/19]\nWritten answers (Question to Transport)\nMinister for Transport, Tourism and Sport\nThe whole-of-Government Climate Action Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland's overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car fleet accounts for over half of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emission vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.\nIn order to expedite the deployment of low emitting vehicles an inter-Departmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was jointly established by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to consider a full suite of potential measures available to Government. Phase 1 of the Taskforce concentrated on EVs; as part of this work, the important leadership role that Public Bodies and Government Departments can play in encouraging LEV uptake was examined. The Taskforce recommended the introduction of a new public procurement framework for EVs by 2020 and this recommendation was echoed in the Climate Action Plan (Action 149). The Office of Government Procurement is now developing a direct drawdown mechanism to allow public sector bodies to purchase an EV with a reduced administrative burden. It is expected that this measure will promote greater uptake of EVs in the State vehicle fleet, significantly reducing corresponding automotive emissions.\nAs battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition towards EVs, with low emitting vehicles being favoured where feasible. In some limited cases, the operational requirements and the specific nature of certain work may not be adequately served by the range of lower emitting vehicles available, although this limitation is likely to reduce over time. Nonetheless, I note that the Deputy is asking specifically about passenger cars, and in those cases it is expected that EVs can offer a suitable low emitting solution for very many of the passenger car needs of State bodies.\nI would like to reassure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary to ensure that Ireland and the State are well positioned to make the transition to low emission vehicles as efficiently and rapidly as possible.\nCycling Policy\n2314. Deputy John Curran asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he will provide additional details and the timeline for the establishment of the cycling project office as mentioned in the Climate Action Plan 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Deputy James Browne asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he has discussed with his UK counterpart the interest of the UK in the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company in the context of UK-Irish relations. [32179\/19]\n2318. Deputy James Browne asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he has applied to the EU for exemptions under state aid rules to allow State investment in Rosslare Europort. [32182\/19]\n2319. Deputy James Browne asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he has addressed the issue of the ownership of Rosslare Europort with his UK counterpart in view of the threats of Brexit and the need to develop ports to ensure businesses can access markets. [32183\/19]\n2374. Deputy James Browne asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he has discussed with his UK counterpart the ownership model of Rosslare Europort. [32178\/19]\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 2317 to 2319, inclusive, and 2374 together.\nRosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts, but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann. Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side.\nThe status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.\nTheir report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.\nIn order to assist Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port. However, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.\nFollowing that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department. If there are any new developments I will of course consider them. In the meantime, I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities.\nI have met individually with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, to discuss Brexit matters on three occasions since mid-2017. I most recently met the Secretary of State, at his request, in Dublin on 8 November last. Our discussion fully respected the mandate of the EU's Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier.

Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the port over the coming years. This includes investment plans for up to \u20ac25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets and new technology. The port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business. Investment in the port is, in the first instance, a matter for its owner, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann which is a commercial State body, and, while EU State Aid Rules restrict the scope for direct State investment, the company is exploring appropriate investment possibilities in connection with its strategic development plans.\nFinally, Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for the additional border controls that will arise from Brexit. In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year about the infrastructural requirements of the port in connection with Brexit."}

(Image by Joshua Auld \/ Argonne National Laboratory.)\nAfter developing their high fidelity predictive transportation system model, POLARIS, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory recently hit a crescendo by simulating the impacts of a multitude of potential future transportation scenarios across the Chicago metropolitan area.\nNow, like any good band, they're on to the next city.\n\"Our integrated modeling workflow provided unique insights into the impact of new technologies on energy and mobility, including some potential negative effects of driverless vehicles, for the Chicago Metropolitan area,\" said Joshua Auld, a technical manager for Transportation Systems and Mobility at Argonne's Center for Transportation Research. \u200b\"However, expanding the findings to other metropolitan areas is critical since each area has its own unique characteristics, culture, land form and transportation assets.\"\n\"Building detailed travel behavior models is critical to properly predict how individuals travel and respond to new mobility technologies,\" Auld said. \u200b\"We simulate large-scale urban and metropolitan areas, including all of the transport modes and travel episodes for every resident in the area, to understand how users interact in the system and how different technologies impact the overall system performance.\"\nAs part of DOE's multi-lab Systems and Modeling for Accelerated Research in Transportation (SMART) Mobility Consortium, Argonne developed POLARIS to be able to dial up and down a large number of inputs \u2014 land use, electric vehicle (EV) charging, passenger and goods movement, traveler behavior \u2014 and model what happens to vehicle miles traveled, congestion, vehicle hours traveled, energy, cost, greenhouse gases as a result.\nTo develop the Chicago model, they worked with multiple organizations, including the city's Department of Transportation, transit and planning agencies, universities and non-profits. They're keeping that same partnership approach as they expand to Atlanta, Austin and Detroit.\n\"The new models will allow us to explore the impact of new transportation technologies and mobility trends across different geographies, populations, and infrastructure,\" Auld said. \u200b\"The project expands the scope of analysis and will help to potentially generalize findings from the SMART Mobility research program.\"\nPOLARIS is a travel behavior, traffic flow and network operations simulation tool where all of these aspects of the transportation system for a region are modeled dynamically, in a fully integrated manner, as travelers respond in modeled real-time to changing network conditions, control signals and the actions of other travelers and management authorities.\nIn Atlanta, researchers are working with Georgia Tech and the Atlanta Regional Commission; in Austin, it's the University of Texas-Austin and the Capital Area Metropolitan Organization. In Detroit, developers are working with the Ford Motor Company.\nThe ultimate goals of the project are to deploy the tools to other researchers and stakeholders to support future decisions and continue to bring POLARIS to new audiences in other metropolitan areas. \u200b\"What I enjoy most about this project is to take all of the hard work that our team has put in to the development of the state-of-the-art POLARIS simulator and working with local stakeholders to see the model actually being deployed and demonstrating its usefulness to government agencies, planners, academics and industry,\" Auld said.\nThe SMART Mobility Consortium is funded by the Energy Efficient Mobility Systems Program of the Vehicle Technologies Office, DOE Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy.\nTags: Modeling and Simulation, Transportation, Transportation Systems, Georgia, Texas, Michigan, Intersections Fall 2020\nJoshua A.

{"text":"Global Feed Processing Equipment Market\nFeed Processing Equipment Global Market Report 2021 - By Function (Pelleting, Mixing, Grinding, Extrusion), By Feed Type (Ruminant Feed, Poultry Feed, Swine Feed, Aquaculture Feed), By Application (Poultry, Pig, Ruminant, Aqua), COVID-19 Impact And Recovery\nThe feed processing equipment market consists of sales of feed processing equipment by entities (organizations, sole traders, or partnerships) that are engaged in manufacturing feed processing equipment such as feed expanders, feed conditioners, pellet feed coolers, etc. Only goods and services traded between entities or sold to end consumers are included.\nThe global feed processing equipment market is expected to grow from $47.77 billion in 2020 to $52.3 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5%. The growth is mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $70.06 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 7.6%.\nThe feed processing equipment market covered in this report is segmented by function into pelleting, mixing, grinding, extrusion, by feed type into ruminant feed, poultry feed, swine feed, aquaculture feed, other animal feed.\nThe growing demand for feed across the globe to meet the needs of the rising livestock population is expected to drive the feed processing equipment market. The rise in livestock population led to increase in the requirement for feed which in turn is likely to fuel the demand for feed processing equipment. According to the 20th Livestock Census report by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Fisheries, published in October 2019, the total livestock population in India is 535.78 million in 2019 which recorded an increase of 4.6% over the livestock census of 2012. As per the report by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Agricultural Statistics Board, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) released in February 2019, the total cattle and calves population in the USA is 94.8 million as of January 1, 2019, which slightly increased from 94.3 million on January 1, 2018. The feed is utilized for rearing livestock as it provides a high nutritional diet which in turn increases productivity. Hence, the growing demand for the feed across the globe aids in the growth of the market.\nThe high operational and maintenance cost of the feed mill is expected to hinder the feed processing equipment market. The cost of establishing a feed mill includes design and development, equipment, installation, operational, and maintenance costs. According to the American Feed Industry Association, engineering and design, equipment and installation, and operation and maintenance cost contribute to about 1%, 15%, and 50% respectively of the total investment over a feed mill's lifetime. Moreover, electricity and labor require high capital investment making it unaffordable for middle, low-income producers, thereby acting as a major restraint for the market growth.\nPlant manufacturers are launching revolutionary technology intending to improve the operation, increase efficiency, and setting up other equipment to offer an advantage over other machines. In June 2018, Van Aarsen launched a Continuous Pellet Coater (CPC) machine with new feed pellet coating technology, the latest development in coating technology that adds fats and soluble additives such as enzymes and probiotics or vitamins to animal feed pellets. It is concerned with accurate monitoring of the retention time within the mixer which ensures optimized communication between pellets. Moreover, in June 2020, Imas, a supplier of milling technology, has developed a new type of feed mill with a compact design for the feed industry with a capacity of 2 to 3 tons per hour.\nIn December 2019, Vermeer Corporation, a USA-based manufacturer of industrial and agricultural machines acquired Schuler Manufacturing Co for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition aims to use Schuler Manufacturing Co.'s feed equipment to reinforce Vermeer Corporation's long-term vision of developing new product technologies for cattle producers through the entire chain of hay and feed value.

{"text":"Home solar energy Cheaper solar energy using iron instead of expensive rare and expensive metals?\nCheaper solar energy using iron instead of expensive rare and expensive metals?\nThe new molecule (Illustration: Nils Rosemann)\nFor the first time, researchers have succeeded in creating an iron molecule that can function both as a photocatalyst to produce fuel and in solar cells to produce electricity. The results indicate that the iron molecule could replace the more expensive and rarer metals used today.\nSome photocatalysts and solar cells are based on a technology that involves molecules containing metals, known as metal complexes. The task of the metal complexes in this context is to absorb solar rays and utilise their energy. The metals in these molecules pose a major problem, however, as they are rare and expensive metals, such as the noble metals ruthenium, osmium and iridium.\n\"Our results now show that by using advanced molecule design, it is possible to replace the rare metals with iron, which is common in the Earth's crust and therefore cheap\", says Chemistry Professor Kenneth W\u00e4rnmark of Lund University in Sweden.\nTogether with colleagues, Kenneth W\u00e4rnmark has for a long time worked to find alternatives to the expensive metals. The researchers focused on iron which, with its six per cent prevalence in the Earth's crust, is significantly easier to source. The researchers have produced their own iron-based molecules whose potential for use in solar energy applications has been proven in previous studies.\nIn this new study, the researchers have moved one step further and developed a new iron-based molecule with the ability to capture and utilise the energy of solar light for a sufficiently long time for it to react with another molecule. The new iron molecule also has the ability to glow long enough to enable researchers to see iron-based light with the naked eye at room temperature for the first time.\n\"The good result depends on the fact that we have optimised the molecular structure around the iron atom\", explains colleague Petter Persson of Lund University.\nThe study is now published in the journal Science. According to the researchers, the iron molecule in question could be used in new types of photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel, either as hydrogen through water splitting or as methanol from carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the new findings open up other potential areas of application for iron molecules, e.g. as materials in light diodes (LEDs).\nWhat surprised the Lund researchers is that they arrived at good results so quickly.

{"text":"Why the Voting Rights Act Matters for Environmentalists\nAug. 04, 2015 10:14AM EST Politics\nMany people who care about climate change understand the corrupting influence of big money in politics and rightfully sound the alarm when elected officials who are supposed to represent their constituents instead protect corporate profits. This is especially true when it comes to big political spenders and climate polluters like the Koch Brothers and the fossil fuel companies like Shell.\nThe Greenpeace toxic patrol, lead by Damu Smith, protests against the toxics industry with a banner reading: \ufffdEnvironmental Justice Now\ufffd which is displayed along with other banners as the activists protest through the street. Photo credit: Robert Visser \/ Greenpeace\nHowever, voter suppression and disenfranchisement are not as commonly talked about in the environmental community. This despite the fact that denying the right to vote strips people of access to a cornerstone of our democracy and a way to have their interests represented in decisions that impact them\u2014including issues of climate and environmental health.\nIt's high time we make those connections.\nClimate Justice and Voting Rights\nJacqueline Patterson, environmental and climate justice director at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), explains the intersectionality of race, voting rights, climate justice and health in a fantastic blog here.\nIn her piece, Patterson calls out the fact that \"African American children [are] four times as likely as White American children to die from asthma attacks tied to poor air quality for coal fired plants and other facilities and with the rampant loss of life we are seeing from extreme weather events in our communities and worldwide driven by climate change, which largely results from fossil fuel based energy production.\"\nMarginalized communities\u2014often communities of color that have been historically disenfranchised\u2014disproportionately suffer environmental harms and often have the fewest resources available to counteract those harms. When we recognize that a healthy environment and a healthy democracy go hand in hand, it's clear that ensuring the right to vote is critical.\nAs Patterson puts it:\n\"\u2026 [W]ith entities that have driven the agenda towards stripping voting rights planning on putting $889 million into the coming elections, we must all lean in together on campaign finance reform and voting rights so that communities (and all of us) feel that our votes and our advocacy on issues like net metering, energy efficiency, renewable portfolio standards and indeed relatedly, income inequality and community policing, will actually add value and have a transformational impact.\"\nAside from being just plain wrong, disenfranchising impacted communities gives corporations and oligarchs even more power to recklessly plunder the world around us. Equality and justice are part of our shared vision for the future. We must stand with our allies to move that vision forward.\nWhat Happened to the Voting Rights Act?\nFifty years ago, the Civil Rights Movement paved the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Though the fight for justice continues to this day, this was a monumental victory for a movement that was struggling for freedom and self-determination, as it outlawed many of the tools used by racist state and local governments to deny people of color and language minority groups the ability to exercise their right to vote.\nHowever, in June 2013\u2014after 48 years and more than 700 instances of discriminatory impacts prevented by the law between 1982 and 2006 alone\u2014the Supreme Court's conservative majority struck down key pieces of the Voting Rights Act in a case called Shelby County v. Holder. This decision made it far easier for states to pass discriminatory voting measures and more difficult for people of color and language minority groups to register, vote and have their votes counted equally.\nThis was a huge blow. In the words of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, \"In this 50th anniversary year of the Voting Rights Act, voters are more vulnerable to discrimination than at any time since the law was first passed in 1965.\"\nIn 2015, the right to vote and to have votes counted fairly is still at stake. Though voting has always been one of many ways of building and exercising power and holding elected officials accountable to the communities they are supposed to represent, we are all being called upon (again) to support this most basic right.\nCivil rights organizations are leading the charge for a gold standard when it comes to voting rights in the U.S. and it's up to everyone\u2014members of labor unions, environmental organizations and many others\u2014to stand by these leaders in calling for the U.S. to live up to its promise of democracy for all Americans.\nJoin the call. Tell your member of Congress that it's time to restore the Voting Rights Act.\nJimmy Carter: The U.S. Is an 'Oligarchy With Unlimited Political Bribery'\nJon Stewart's 5 Best Segments Bashing Climate Deniers\nInside Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's Mass Appeal to Americans\npolitics featured sponsored-home"}

But current earnings are not the only factor that matters when valuing a firm. Future earnings and efficiency improvements also matter. And on that front, there is a lot of disparity between different firms.\nEfficiency is the new mantra for many firms across the oil patch, but it's also easier said than done. Growing production at any cost is easy, and that's what many firms have done in the last few years. Now that the good times are over, executives face the daunting task of making that production profitable on a sustained basis. In the Permian Basin there will be winners and losers, but three companies stand out as having exceptional opportunities over the next few years based on their early efforts at efficiency gains. Related: Why The Oil Rally May Well Be Over\nTopping the list of interesting opportunities in the Permian Basin is one of the largest independent players, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). OXY carries the size (~$60 billion market cap) and diversification while simultaneously having enough exposure to the Permian to make it an appealing opportunity for investors not interested in taking big risks.\nOXY has one of the best balance sheets in the industry right now, which was highlighted in the firm's last report. Management indicated that 2015 capex would probably come in below its initial expectations of $5.8 billion, and it highlighted progress on important cost cutting and efficiency measures.\nMoreover, the firm pays a substantial dividend that actually looks safe at any reasonable forecast of near-term future oil process. The firm's maintenance capex is low enough that it should be able to cover both capex and its $3 per share dividend without resorting to borrowing, all at low oil prices.\nThe firm reiterated its expectation that it would be cash flow neutral for 2015 at oil prices of $60 per barrel after paying its dividend. Well cost, drilling time, and other in situ site metrics all look set to improve by double digits through the year, and with the stock still down substantially year-over-year, there is likely to be a significant medium term opportunity here. Related: Peak Oil: Myth Or Coming Reality?\nFor contrarian investors, there are few better stocks in the oil business than Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD). The firm has had its share of controversy with Wall Street lately, and for a $22 billion stock, the short interest in the name is pretty considerable at around 6 percent.\nStill, like every other firm in the industry, PXD is taking steps to clean up its act and improve efficiency. The firm recently reported \"clean\" EPS and Cash Flow per share of -$0.03 and $2.42 respectively. This was below the Street consensus at $0.06.\nNonetheless, the play with PXD is a long-term one. The company has arguably the best Permian Basin long-term runway in the business with something on the order of 9.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. The firm's resource base is literally measurable in decades of production terms. While the company's value then is in the ground, and it does cost money to get those resources out of the ground, in a deflationary well cost environment, that kind of long-term production pipeline actually gets more valuable over time, especially if costs deflate at a faster rate than the discount rate on PXD's capital. Related: Renewable Energy Could Dominate Electricity Market In 15 Years\nFinally, for investors willing to take on some risks, small-cap producer Ring Energy Inc (NYSEMKT: REI) is an interesting choice. The firm has only been public for a couple of years and its market cap is less than $500 million so it lacks the heft and track-record of many larger older firms. Still, the firm is operating profitably and executives have expressed confidence about the company's ability to earn an acceptable rate of return even at $50 a barrel.\nManagement has been a big buyer of stock, and while the research around benefits from copying insider buying is mixed, management confidence in the future is never a bad sign for investors.

The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible,\" the 2014 IPCC report stated.\nIPCC's scientists stated the global surface temperature is likely to increase by as much as 1.5 degrees (Celsius) by 2100.\nWhether these future projections, which are extrapolated from past data and historical patterns, come true remains to be seen, of course. The scientific team behind the 2014 IPCC report stated much of what is forecast could be prevented if certain measures are put in place now.\nThe full SWRB resolution can be viewed on the agency's website.\nMeanwhile a group of researchers \u2013 led by University of California, Santa Barbara scientist Qinghua Ding \u2013 stated the relationship between warming temperatures and Arctic sea-ice loss is not yet fully understood.\nDing and his colleagues stated natural summertime circulation patterns could be responsible for about half of September Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979.\nThe report basically points out nature plays a significant role in contributing to melting ice conditions in addition to man-made causes to climate change."}

Coyne\non June 6, 2014 at 8:58 AM\nOpen Engagement, an annual conference at the Queens Museum, brings together dozens of scholars, artists, curators, advocates and social workers to share ideas and generate conversations across geographical and professional boundaries. Building from the theme of live\/work, attendees were continually challenged to consider methods of seamlessly connecting art with life.\nSunday programming at Open Engagement brought a focus on pedagogy and what each of us, as individuals, can do. The potential of each of our contributions to a critical discourse and positive change was highlighted in each of the presentations and panels, closing with the ultimate testament to individual social practice, a keynote speech by Mirele Laderman Ukeles.\nThe conference featured a series of speakers as a part of an Open Platform who shared their projects in 10-minute presentations. As presenter Joseph Krupczynski quoted, \"teaching is learning and learning is teaching.\" Each of the projects shared methods by which pedagogical practice could often function as a work in and of itself. For example, Nina Bellsio of St. Thomas Aquinas College formulated a requirement for her design students to create and brand a completely sustainable product with packaging. In challenging her students to consider these aspects of newly introduced products, Bellsio fostered a macro concern for resource conservation, and encouraged an internalization of outside-the-box thinking. While many of the projects and ideas presented throughout the conference excelled as social practice and communal leadership, Bellsio's work allowed a momentary return to actual formal art production and the way in which the aestheticization of life could simultaneously advance a greater concern for life and sustainable manufacturing.\nThis fundamental act of challenging the way we approach the world around us likewise defines Joseph Krupczynski's teaching practice. In his program at UMass Amherst, Krupczynski's students engage with the development of real-world social practice projects, such as running a community book-trade shop. These projects are actively recorded in blogs and online journals, which Krupczynski believes encourages community connection in addition to the development of his student's self-awareness and writing skills. Much like Bellsio's initiative, Krupczynski stressed the importance of developing a society in which social practice was not as much an isolated artistic activity but a way of life.\nThis systematic wearing away of the boundaries between art and life came to the fore in James McAnally's I am for an artist who vanishes, a presentation to be given by the Temporary Art Review editor. Electing to remain invisible, it was announced that McAnally had chosen to instead have a third party present the talk just before he was scheduled to appear, separating the content from the artist's identity and intentionally blurring the individual voice.1\nGrounded in Claes Oldenburg's manifesto, I am for an art, which proclaims: \"I am for all art that takes its form from the lines of life itself, that twists and extends and accumulates and spits and drips, and is heavy and coarse and blunt and sweet and stupid as life itself,\" McAnally's writing addresses this utopian musing of an art that could exist completely independently of the mechanisms of the art world.\nThese themes were revised again in an open workshop titled Curating for a Socially Engaged Art featuring Bill Kelley Jr, curator of the Getty Pacific Standard Time series LA\/LA (Los Angeles\/Latin America); Josh McPhee, founder of Justseeds Cooperative; and Erin Sickler, curator of the Queens International and member of Arts & Labor. Although not directly addressed, each of the curator's projects towards collective and social practice that fundamentally challenged the traditional role of curator and impresario to the virtuoso artist.2 Instead of acting as director of a cast of artists, the curators forming the panel, together with moderator Prerana Reddy suggested options for understanding the curator as collaborator or sponsor to greater vision. As Kelley explained during the panel, the curator could act"}
{"text":" as an agent, restraining his or her individual vision into a supportive infrastructure to allow greater ideas to flourish.\nBy re-phrasing the relationship between art and life into that of art and work, we can consider not only how art can enter into daily habits and experiences, but also how to more fully examine the complex ways in which art and our means of earning capital are intertwined. Through both the conference and discussions generated over the course of the weekend, Open Engagement suggested alternative ways of infusing work with life, life with work and forging new interfaces within artistic social practice.\nMary Coyne was both the presenter and the author of this review. To avoid conflicts of interest, this review was edited and published by a third party to preserve some separation between the talk and publication of the review. \u21a9\nArt Historian and Curator Jan Vermunt's consideration of the artist\/curator relationship was defined at a talk given at the New Museum at the \"These Things Called Exhibitions\" symposium on April 19, 2014. \u21a9\nNew York CityReviews\nBill Kelley JrErin Sicklerjames mcanallyJen Delos ReyesJoseph KrupczynskiMary CoyneNina BellsioOpen EngagementPrerana ReddyQueens Museum\nMary Coyne is an art historian, writer and critic based in New York.

{"text":"ALEC Holds Virtual States and National Policy Summit\nSubmitted by David Armiak on December 7, 2020 - 4:48pm\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) meets virtually this week for its second conference of the year, the States and Nation Policy Summit. Like its annual meeting in July, ALEC had hoped to hold the meeting in person, but moved to an online format when that no longer seemed possible due to COVID-19 public health restrictions.\nLast summer, ALEC went so far as to circulate among its members a thank you letter to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) for \"wisely tak[ing] the first steps to safely reopen Florida,\" but it appears that the letter never went out after ALEC moved its annual meeting from Orlando to Zoom.\nALEC has played a leading role in pushing for the economy to remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic, going so far as to circulate a sign-on letter from \"policy leaders and elected officials\" to President Trump and state leaders urging them to \"reopen the economy and get people back to work.\"\nConfirmed speakers for this week's meeting include Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who recently announced that he will step down on January 20, and newly elected congresswomen and ALEC alumni Nancy Mace (SC-01) and Victoria Spartz (IN-05).\nALEC summit attendees will also have the opportunity to hear a number of panels on \"what will be needed to restore consumer confidence in air travel,\" on \"effective strategies for regulatory reform in the 2021 legislative sessions,\" and on \"how this election will effect the future of energy moving forward,\" among many others.\nALEC Expands Its Call for a Rewrite of the Constitution\nALEC will again call for an Article V convention to radically rewrite the U.S. Constitution at the policy summit, although this time ALEC is focused on maintaining its right-wing majority on the U.S. Supreme Court by requiring that the nation's highest court stick with nine justices.\nIf passed by members, the Model Application under Article V of the U.S. Constitution to Propose an Amendment to Require the Supreme Court of the United States to Be Composed of Nine Justices provides state lawmakers with language to introduce in legislative sessions next year.\nAnd just in case the Article V route does not work, ALEC members will consider a model resolution calling on Congress to send to the states a constitutional amendment to do the same thing.\nThis fall, ALEC circulated and submitted a letter urging the swift confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, stating that she is \"tremendously qualified\" for the Supreme Court, despite having less than three years of experience on the bench, and that she \"has also promised to follow in the footsteps of one of her mentors, Justice Antonin Scalia.\" Barrett was nominated by Trump following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nAt its annual meeting last summer, ALEC introduced a new plan to force an Article V convention. \"The new plan, presented during the ALEC workshop with a PowerPoint presentation from conservative activist David Biddulph, is to take the 28 state resolutions seeking a balanced budget amendment and combine them with six state resolutions passed over the last two centuries generally seeking a constitutional convention,\" the Associated Press reported.\nExploiting COVID-19\nALEC again will exploit the COVID-19 crisis to push through a number of policy items on its wish list at the summit. The first, the Emergency Power Limitation Act, would limit governors' power to enact emergency orders, shifting the balance of power during an emergency to legislatures.\nDuring the pandemic, many governors have faced legal challenges from right-wing litigation outfits such as the Bradley Foundation-funded Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty in Wisconsin, the National Rifle Association, churches, and others to upend public health orders designed to prevent the spread of the virus. If passed, ALEC's model bill will make it harder for governors to quickly respond to public health emergencies.\nAfter publishing a letter opposing federal assistance to states and localities facing budget shortfalls due to the ongoing pandemic, calling it \"harmful,\" ALEC is now asking members to consider passing a Resolution in Opposition to Federal Bailouts of State Budgets. If passed, ALEC lawmakers could introduce the resolution for passage in by state legislatures and put pressure on the federal government to not provide financial relief to the states.\nALEC is also asking members to support passage of a Statement of Principles on Sound Rainy Day Fund Practices that encourages states to set up \"rainy day funds\" for economic downturns and require a supermajority vote to withdraw funds.\nALEC Offers Election Trainings\nALEC will again also offer ALEC meeting attendees special trainings. Despite its charitable 501(c)(3) status, which prohibits it from engaging in politics, ALEC is coaching its legislative members, the vast majority of whom are Republicans, on winning election strategies.\nIn \"Digital Media: Applying Presidential Strategy to Legislative Races,\""}
{"text":" ALEC will teach attendees how to utilize digital tools like Trump to \"build a base of supporters to help spread a grassroots message online, drive online donations and expand your reach.\"\nIn another special training, \"renowned pollster and friend of ALEC\" Frank Luntz will educate attendees on \"the best way to engage and invest your constituents in a commitment to lifelong learning and skill development to empower the future workforce.\" With this training, Luntz is following up on his October 15 presentation for ALEC legislative members on \"Words that Work in 2020,\" where he told them, \"COVID 'trumps' jobs and the economy.\"\nLimiting Plaintiffs' Rights in Court\nALEC has two measures on the table at its policy summit to make it more challenging for injured people to hold corporations accountable.\nThe Anchors Away Act, if passed, would prevent plaintiffs from asking for a specific dollar amount \"noneconomic damages\" like pain and suffering in tort cases. ALEC argues that, \"Because noneconomic damages are subjective, the suggested award may be arbitrary,\" and overly influence a jury's verdict.\nThe Asbestos Litigation Over-Naming Reform Act, is yet another in a series of model bills ALEC has proposed to disadvantage workers suffering lung disease from asbestos exposure and protect asbestos companies and their insurers. The bill would place further restrictions on the filing of asbestos exposure suits by requiring plaintiffs to submit specific information about each defendant within 30 days from the original complaint.\nALEC Weighs in on Independent Contracting\nIn putting forth its Statement of Principles on Independent Contracting, ALEC is injecting itself into a renewed debate over how an independent contractor is defined in the so-called gig economy. The Statement proposes an end to government regulations over independent contracting and instead allow contractors and employers the flexibility over how to craft their working arrangements.\nThe introduction of this statement comes just weeks after California voters approved Proposition 22, in the costliest ballot measure battle in the state's history, which overturned a court ruling in order to allow companies such as Uber and Lyft to classify app-based drivers in the state as independent contractors\nCalifornia passed AB 5 in 2019, which significantly reduced the number of workers that qualified as independent contractors. Uber and Lyft attempted to argue in court that their drivers do not qualify as employees under the new law, but a California Appeals Court disagreed in October.\nAlthough Lyft and Uber have not been confirmed as members of ALEC, Lyft is a member of NetChoice, a regular sponsor of ALEC meetings that sits on ALEC's Private Enterprise Board of Directors and chairs ALEC's Communications and Technology Task Force.\nOther New Model Bills and Resolutions Being Considered:\nAmerican Civics History Initiative Bill\nHome-Based Business Fairness Act\nPharmacy and Pharmacy Patient Protection Act\nResolution in Support of End-of-Year Fiscal Responsibility\nResolution in Support of Telehealth Modernization Principles\nResolution on Patient Access to Physical Therapists' Services Without Current Professional Practice Restrictions Regarding Referral\nProtecting Everyone's Constitutional Rights Act\nPublic Nuisance Reform Act\nResolution Supporting the United States in Signing a Bilateral Trade Agreement with Taiwan\nResolution Urging Congress to Reassert Its Constitutional Authority over International Commerce\nStatement of Principles on Facial Recognition Policy\nTextbook Cost Transparency Act\nUnattended Retail Innovation Act\nPhoto credit: @ALEC_states\nDavid Armiak is research director with the Center for Media and Democracy.

The panel members were: Mikhail Chudakov, deputy director general and head of the Department of Nuclear Energy at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); Alexey Likhachov, CEO of Rosatom; Pekka Lundmark, president and CEO of Fortum Corporation; Yafes Osman, Bangladesh's minister of science and technology; Nenad Popovi\u0107, Serbia's minister without portfolio responsible for innovation and technological development; and Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade.\nThe fact government ministries and state-owned companies made up the panel, and that the nuclear industry's Harmony goal of adding 1000 GW of new capacity by 2050 had captured their imaginations, showed how this clean, reliable and affordable energy source is securing its place in the political debate on climate change and energy demand. Later the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear references to the role of nuclear power in the global energy mix during the plenary he hosted titled Sustainable energy for a changing world, the panel members of which were drawn however fr om the oil and gas sectors only. Russia is the world's leading natural gas producer and its second largest oil producer. It is also the world's fourth biggest nuclear power producer (after the USA, France and China).\nRising told World Nuclear News: \"It's encouraging to have such a high-level international panel on new nuclear deployment at a general energy forum mainly focused on oil and gas. This is the second year that nuclear power has been on the programme, but it is more prominent this time.\"\nIn her opening remarks to delegates at the nuclear power session, Rising described the \"two essential requirements\" for the world's future energy system: \"It must provide enough energy to meet global development needs and it must do so in a way that does not harm the planet\".\nThe Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force in November 2016, had heralded a shift to clean energy, including nuclear power, she noted.\n\"Currently, nuclear energy provides around 10.5% of the world's electricity from power plants with a combined capacity of 400 GW. The nuclear industry has set a target for nuclear energy to provide 25% of global electricity demand by 2050, which would require the construction of 1000 GW of new nuclear capacity. Achieving this target is a necessary component of a sustainable energy system,\" she said.\nThis target requires the rate of new build to treble. \"This is practical, this is achievable, and the industry has proven that we can do this,\" she said. \"In the mid-1980s we delivered 30 GW in one year. Over a period of ten to 20 years, we were delivering 20 GW per year. We need to go back to that construction model in order to deliver what is so important for the world - 1000 GW by 2050. We need to establish a level playing field, but we must also have harmonised regulatory processes, we need to be able to timely license new designs of reactors, and we also need to create an effective safety paradigm.\"\nLikhachov described 20-25 GW per year as a \"concrete rate\" for new build. \"We are doing all we can to help achieve that 1000 GW by 2050,\" he said, but then stressed the international character of the nuclear industry.\n\"We work on profoundly integrated international projects and not a single nuclear unit we build is 100% Russian - it may be that the turbines, for example, are French, so our approach is developed collectively, and our workforce includes personnel from other countries. Rosatom's openness and transparency guarantees that all of our projects are based on the best technologies, the best professionals and the best competences.\"\nRosatom's sodium-cooled fast reactor, or MBIR, project is \"an excellent example\", he said, \"of how people are coming together to start working on a Generation IV"}
{"text":" reactor\".\n\"Cooperation between the various players in the nuclear industry isn't a dream but a fact of life today and we are proud of that, proud that countries believe in us,\" he said.\nRenewables need nuclear\nRising asked Chudakov how he sees the role of nuclear energy in achieving the United Nations goals for sustainable development and also as a solution to climate change.\nThe IAEA has noted, he said, that around 70% of the world's electricity is currently produced through the burning of fossil fuels. To meet climate goals by 2050, 80% of electricity will need to be from low-carbon sources.\n\"No single source of energy can do it without nuclear,\" he said. \"It's clear that renewable energy can't do it by itself and will be self-limited to a share of up to 40% [of the global energy mix] by 2050. Also, renewable energy is not dispatchable; it needs back up and this must be done by nuclear power.\"\nThe IAEA's latest forecast for new nuclear capacity shows that by 2050 there will not be the 1000 GW required, but about 700 GW, he said.\n\"The main obstacles to nuclear are not technical, but political. This is about public acceptance, stakeholder involvement, investment, government support - these are the main obstacles and we are working on them. We must educate the public and cause a paradigm shift from public acceptance of nuclear power to public demand for it.\"\nThe IAEA plans to hold its first international conference on climate change in October next year, he noted. \"We must use every stage to highlight that without nuclear we cannot fulfil our obligations on climate change and sustainable development.\"\nTurning to the topic of newcomer countries, Rising asked Osman how Bangladesh is working to build nuclear power into its energy infrastructure.\n\"Bangladesh is suffering because of climate change and without electricity you cannot change the life of the people. We need electricity but at the same time without disturbing the climate. That is our philosophy and our goal and that is why we are going for nuclear power,\" he said.\nPolitical will to have nuclear power in Bangladesh is \"not new\", he added, since this ambition dates back to 1962, before its secession as a separate country from Pakistan.\n\"We are a small country with so many people to feed and our policy is that nuclear power is one of the options; we want at least 10% of our energy to come from nuclear,\" he said.\nRosatom is building two VVER-1200 units at Rooppur, which is 160 km from Dhaka. The project is \"another cornerstone\", Osman said, in the longstanding friendly relations between Russia and Bangladesh. Rooppur 1 is scheduled to begin operation in 2023, with Rooppur 2 following in 2024.\nThe contract is worth USD12.65 billion, including the first few years' fuel. Russia in 2016 agreed to provide an USD11.38 billion credit facility for 90% of the project, with Bangladesh to meet the remainder of the project costs from state-funded grants.\nThe Rooppur project would not have been possible without funding from Rosatom, Osman said, but Bangladesh's introduction of nuclear power to its energy mix will serve as a reference point.\nAsked about newcomer countries like Bangladesh, Chudakov said: \"We have 30 countries operating 454 reactors and about the same number of countries, if not more, that have declared an interest in having nuclear in their energy mix. These countries are at different stages; those that are already constructing nuclear power plants, like Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates and Belarus, and several that have just started, like Turkey, or are going to start, like Egypt. There are others, in Africa and Asia, and we are helping them to create the necessary infrastructure in order to operate nuclear power plants safely for centuries to come.\"\nThe work involved in establishing the infrastructure needed to support a nuclear power programme is challenging, he said, and some countries have therefore extended the time they believe they will need to do this. These extensions are among the reasons why the agency has seen a decrease in its forecast for new nuclear capacity, he added.\nSzijjarto described Hungary's project to add new units at the site of the existing Paks nuclear power plant, known as Paks II, as essential to national sovereignty.\n\"We really consider it to be an obligation of a state, of a government, to ensure the sovereignty of the given country and one of the most important factors for sovereignty is energy security; that the energy supply of a given country must be stable, predictable, safe and cheap,\" he said. \"If you put the question, what's the cheapest, safest and cleanest way of generating energy, the answer is obvious - it's nuclear power.\"\nThanks to its 36-year history of nuclear power, \"Hungary is able to say that nuclear is the right choice\", he said. \"Nuclear"}
{"text":" power covers half of Hungary's electricity demand and, by the end of 2030, that share will have risen to 90%,\" he added.\nThe Paks plant, which is 100 km south of Budapest, currently comprises four Russian-supplied VVER-440 pressurised water reactors, which started up between 1982 and 1987. These units have regulatory approval to operate for a further 20 years, meaning they will be phased out during the 2030s.\nRussia and Hungary signed an inter-governmental agreement in early 2014 for Russian enterprises and their international sub-contractors to supply two VVER-1200 reactors at Paks, including a Russian state loan to finance 80% of the project.\nThe debate about nuclear power in general is \"full of hypocrisy and double standards\", Szijjarto said. \"Supporting anti-nuclear is part of political correctness, but we have to stick to our approach that no one should put pressure on us or any other country in putting together its own energy mix,\" he said, referring to Austria's court case against the European Commission for its approval of the Paks II project. Similar opposition to approval of EDF Energy's project to build a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in England failed, he noted.\nThe Paks II project could help \"re-establish pragmatic cooperation between East and West\", he suggested. \"Rosatom is the general contractor, but Western European companies and North American companies are being involved as sub-contractors. Although we understand there is a verbal fight when it comes to the EU and Russia at the political level, when you look under the surface you see huge business being made between Western European companies and Russia. So, there's hypocrisy and double standards.\"\nHe noted the agreement also includes a clause that 40% of the work must be done by local companies, which is a big boost for the Hungarian national economy, he said, and it helps stimulate research and development into nuclear power.\nBusiness and climate change\nLundmark said climate change isn't only a political concern, but a commercial one too.\n\"I'm not a politician, I'm a businessperson and I'm extremely worried about climate change and the environment. We have the 2-degrees Paris target, but recent data show that we are heading for a 3-degrees and potentially a 4- to 6-degrees scenario.\" Nuclear power is \"an absolutely key part of the solution\" to climate change, he said.\n\"The European Union has the target to reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030 and if we take the Paris target of 2 degrees, then the European emission reduction should be 95% by 2050. But this is not only about electricity because of European final energy consumption only 20% is electricity today and 50% goes to industrial and residential heating and 30% goes to traffic. If we want to reach the climate goal then all these sectors must be tackled, which means that the industrial processes at large will also need to be electrified in the future.\n\"This means the 2020s will be the decade of electricity. Electricity demand will increase, we will replace processes that are currently fossil-based with electricity and that electricity needs to be CO2 free. We all know that wind and solar are attracting a lot of investment and that's a very good thing, we are very much involved, and we want to maximise our CO2-free production. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, maybe 50% of the global power mix in 2050 will be solar and wind, but if we want to decarbonise the other 50% then we are really going to need a lot of nuclear because there is not enough hydro in the world.\n\"If we want to achieve 1000 GW of new nuclear capacity, which I think is an excellent target, then the nuclear industry needs to renew itself. We must develop and become more efficient as an industry; we can't afford extremely long projects with significant cost overruns \u2026 There have been other industries that have been able to create scalable mass markets with serial production of equipment.\n\"We need harmonisation of safety requirements internationally. I have full understanding of the problems for the reactor vendors when they have to adapt their rector design for the requirements of each and every country separately. It's like Boeing having to build different aircraft for different countries - imagine how complicated and difficult that would be. Nobody wants to compromise on safety, but we need international coordination.\"\nNuclear power must be more affordable if the industry wants to compete with other sources of electricity, he said. \"The cost of wind and solar has dropped significantly. I want to believe that there will be ways to significantly decrease the cost of nuclear as well through serial production. We are heavily involved in research projects on small modular reactors, wh ere modules could be factory built with passive safety features and then sent to the site to be quickly installed and which could run there and then be taken back to the factory when their lifetime is over.\n\"So, these types of things, both on the safety side and"}
{"text":" on the international standardisation side, and normal industrial processes creating serial production for the key components, would be what we as an industry would need to do if we want to win back the trust of the politicians and of the general public in order to be able to meet the 1000 GW target,\" he said.\nPosiva, which is jointly-owned by Fortum and TVO, is working to address another issue that affects public acceptance of nuclear power - the management of waste, Lundmark said.\nIn December 2016, Posiva began construction on a 6500-tonne final waste repository, the world's first permanent underground nuclear waste storage facility, on Olkiluoto island, in Finland. The final disposal facility will consist of an above-ground encapsulation plant, wh ere used fuel will be dried and packed into final disposal canisters made of copper and cast-iron, and a repository consisting of a network of tunnels deep inside the bedrock.\nRising asked him about partnerships in the industry, noting that'mankala' - the ownership model for energy producers which is unique to the Finnish energy markets - is unusual in the nuclear power industry.\nLundmark said: \"Partnerships are absolutely necessary. When we talk about nuclear, Fortum is directly or indirectly involved in all Nordic reactors - both those in operation and those under construction or at the planning stage. This is a capital-intensive industry. Typically, our main role is to bring the operational competence and industrial expertise. Sometimes we participate with a very large share of the capital, of the equity, and sometimes we have a minor share and sometimes nothing at all and we have a service provider role to other investors in projects. We need to develop all kinds of models.\"\nAlthough he understands the comments Szijjarto made about the Paks II project being important for national energy security and sovereignty, Lundmark said \"climate change doesn't respect national borders\".\n\"If every country was to make all its decisions just inside their country and wants to decarbonise their energy system and build big peak capacity only for the needs of that country, then we end up with an extremely expensive system and the question is can it be decarbonised, can climate change be mitigated. That's why international cooperation partnerships will, I think, be very important in the future.\"\nOne example in the power sector, he said, is building interconnectors between countries.\nRevisiting nuclear\nReferring to Nikola Tesla, the Serbia-born inventor and the founder of the Tesla Electric Company in New York, Rising described Serbia as \"the country that first gave electricity to the world, but which has not yet made a decision about their energy portfolio\". Serbia has nevertheless \"considerable experience in the application of nuclear technologies\", she added.\nPopovi\u0107 said Serbia is also proud of another of its late physicists, Pavle Savi\u0107, whose work with Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie on research into the action of neutrons on the heavy elements was an important step in the discovery of nuclear fission.\nYugoslavia had plans to build four nuclear power plants, of which two would be in Serbia, but in 1989 it imposed a moratorium against this, which led to the loss of many of its engineers and scientists to countries with nuclear power, Popovi\u0107 noted.\nPopovi\u0107 and Likhachov signed an intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in innovation and technological development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes during the Atomexpo conference held earlier this year in Sochi, Russia.\nPopovi\u0107 said this was \"a big step in the right direction\", adding that \"in the interim\", several research projects had been conducted with Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland.\n\"In the two months of working with Rosatom, I've received hundreds of calls from academics who are willing to get back into nuclear research. And the public is interested too,\" he said."}

{"text":"Business expenditure & Prior period expenses : Mercantile system of accounting vs. Crystallization of expenses\nShort Overview The incomes or expenses relatable to prior period items were those which arise in the current period, i.e., the period relevant for the purposes of computing the net profit or loss, hence, prior period items were to be included in the determination of the net profit or loss as such prior period expense would be allowed to assessee.\nFrom the Tax Audit Report under section 44AB, AO observed that the Tax Auditor had certified that an amount of Rs. 77,14,27,745 had been debited in the Profit and Loss Account under the head 'Prior Period Expenses'. AO held that in mercantile system of accounting, only income that had accrued during the previous year and the expenses incurred during the said period can only be considered in the taxable income. Hence, AO disallowed prior period expenses. CIT(A) had confirmed the addition.\nIt is held that In mercantile system of accounting, an assessee had not earlier debited his account with the expenditure which accrued in law in an earlier year, would not, in the absence of a barring provisions under the law, disentitle to debit his account later when an enforceable demand was made by the appropriate authority. There is no express bar in law which disallows expenditure relating to a period other than the previous year. Accounting Standard (AS) 5 stipulates that prior period items are income or expenses which arise 'in the current period' as a result of errors or omissions in the preparation of the financial statements of one or more prior periods. Therefore, incomes or expenses relatable to prior period items were those which arise in the current period, i.e., the period relevant for the purposes of computing the net profit or loss, hence prior period items were to be included in the determination of the net profit or loss.\nDecision: In assessee's favour.\nFollowed: CIT v.

However, at the time of hearing we have carefully perused all the"}
{"text":" grounds raised by the Revenue as well as assessee. Most of the grounds raised by the Revenue as well as assessee, are either academic in nature or contentious in nature. However, to meet the end of justice, we confine ourselves to the core of the controversy and main grievances of Revenue and the assessee as well. With this background, we summarize and concise the grounds raised by the Revenue as well as assessee as follows:\nThe Common Grounds raised by assessee in assessment years 2007-08 to 2013-14, are as follows :\u2013\n(1) Disallowance of claim of deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the Motor Spirit New Industrial undertaking of the assessee Company, commissioned on 25-7-2006.\nGround and Assessment Year Amount (Rs.)\nGround No. 4, A.Y. 2007-08 38,65,11,189\nGround No. 3, A.Y. 2008-09 172,37,79,956\n(2) Disallowance of claim of deduction under section 80-IC of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\nGround No. (4) for the Assessment Year 2008-09 351,28,35,732\n(3).

Disallowance of claim of deduction for 'Other Provisions'.\nGround No. (4) for the Assessment Year 2010-11 Rs. 5,61,254\nNow, we shall take above grounds, one by one. Common ground No. 1 raised by the assessee is as follows :\u2013\nThe facts of the case which can be stated quite shortly are as follows: The assessee company is a Public Sector Undertaking engaged in the business of refining of mineral oil and it began its activities on 1-10-2000. The assessee company claimed deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act for the original undertaking till assessment year 2007-08 and the same was allowed. A new undertaking, i.e., a Motor Spirit Plant (MS Plant hereinafter) was commissioned on 25-7-2006.Hence, the assessee claimed deduction available for the new Industrial Undertaking under section 80-IB(9) of the Act for seven assessment years from assessment year 2007-08 to assessment year 2013-14. During assessment proceedings details relating to the M.S. Plant were submitted before the learned assessing officer.\nThe learned assessing officer did not accept the claim of the assessee on two counts. First, he was of the view that, naphtha, the raw material of the new undertaking is not'mineral oil' and secondly, the activities carried out by the new undertaking are not'refining'. He followed para 19.1 of the CBDT Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 where it has been stated that the term'mineral oil' does not include petroleum and natural gases,"}
{"text":" unlike in other sections of the Income Tax Act. The learned assessing officer was of the view that since naphtha is a petroleum product, the term mineral oil does not include it within the meaning of mineral oil for the purpose of section 80-IB(9) of the Act. Further, the learned assessing officer was also of the view that to'refine' means to make fine or to purify without involving any change in the basic product. This way, learned assessing officer disallowed the deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act.\nAggrieved by the stand so taken by the assessing officer, the assessee carried the matter in appeal before the learned Commissioner (Appeals), who has confirmed the disallowance made by assessing officer under section 80-IB(9) of the Act. While dismissing the ground of the assessee, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) observed that the deduction has been claimed by the assessee under clause (iii) of section 80-IB(9) of the Act under which deduction is admissible only if the assessee is engaged in refining of mineral oil. According to learned Commissioner (Appeals), the raw material used by the assessee is Naphtha which is a product of refining of crude oil. Relying on theCircular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 where it has been stated that the term'mineral oil' does not include petroleum and natural gas. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) held that when petroleum is not included under mineral oil, there is no question of Naphtha to be considered as mineral oil because Naphtha, is not petroleum but it is a petroleum product made by refining of crude petroleum oil. Thus, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) held that Naphtha is not mineral oil for the purpose of section 80-IB(9) of the Act. He also held that production of motor spirit from Naphtha is not a process of refining for the purpose of section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) held that a process of refining means to make fine or to purify, without involving any significant change in the substance and if the process involves conversion of one substance into another and especially when it also involves change of chemical composition of the substance, then the process cannot be said to be one of refining. Thus, he held that as process of conversion of Naphtha into Motor spirit involves change of chemical composition and conversion of one substance (Naphtha) into another, i.e., Motor Spirit (Gasoline) with the help of catalysts, this process cannot be a process of refining. He, thus, held that the assessee company did not fulfill the two requirements prescribed under section 80-IB(9) of the Act and upheld the disallowance of the claim of assessee under section 80-IB(9) of the Act by the learned assessing officer.\nAggrieved by the order of the learned Commissioner (Appeals), the assessee is in further appeal before us.\nWe heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission put forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the case laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) and other materials brought on record. Before us, learned Counsel reiterated the submissions made before the authorities below. On the other hand, the learned DR for the Revenue has primarily reiterated the stand taken by the assessing officer, which we have already noted in our earlier para and is not being repeated for the sake of brevity. We note that the assessee company commenced its commercial production of its original undertaking in the previous year relevant to assessment year 2001-02. The company is engaged in the business of a refinery and as it fulfills the required conditions under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act. The assessee company claimed deduction under section 80-IB(9)(iii) for seven assessment years consecutively from assessment year 2001-02 to assessment year 2007-08 and the same were allowed by the Department. The company decided to set up a new undertaking, the Motor Spirit Plant, (referred in brief as the MS Plant), since the assessee company was willing to refine Naphtha generated by its old plant. Earlier, the assessee company had to sell Naphtha, which is also a petroleum product, to power sector industries where it is used as fuel. Now, with the new MS Plant, the assessee company was in a position to refine 'Naphtha' generated by the original plant to produce gasoline which is known in the common parlance as petrol. Had the Motor Spirit Unit been set up along with the original plant, there would not have been any issue of using Naphtha, an intermediary product, in the refining process and the assessee company could have availed the benefit under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act in full. It is submitted"}
{"text":" that Naphtha is also a petroleum product which fall within the definition of 'Mineral oil' and hence the assessee company is entitled to deduction under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act in respect of the new Motor Spirit Unit (MS Plant) which was commissioned on 25-7-2006. We note that section 80-IB of the Act allows deduction in respect of profits and gains from certain industrial undertakings other than infrastructure development undertakings in computing the total income of an assessee an amount equal to such percentage and for such number of assessment years as specified in the section. A perusal of legislative history of section 80-IB(9) of the Act shows that the Finance Act, 1999 restructured old section 80-IA into two sections, section 80-IA and 80-IB, with effect from 1-4-2000 \u2014\n(i). Sub section (9) of section 80-IB of the Act as introduced by Finance Act, 1999 learned 1-4-2000 reads as under :\u2013\n\"(9) The amount of deduction to an undertaking which begins commercial production or refining of mineral oil shall be hundred per cent of the of the profit for a period of seven consecutive assessment years including the initial assessment year :\nProvided that where the undertaking is located in North Eastern Region, it has begun or begins commercial production of mineral oil before the 1-4-1997 and where it is located in any part of India, it begins commercial production of mineral oil on or after the 1-4-1997:\nProvided further that where the undertaking is engaged in refining of mineral oil, it begins refining on or after 1-10-1998.\"\n(ii) Sub-section (9) of section 80-IB of the Act was amended by the Finance Act, 2008 with effect from 1-4-2008, which reads as under :\u2013\n\"(9) The amount of deduction to an undertaking which begins commercial production or refining of mineral oil shall be hundred per cent of the profit for a period of seven consecutive assessment years including the initial assessment year:\nProvided also that where such undertaking begins refining of mineral oil on or after the 1-4-2009, no deduction under this section shall be allowed in respect of such undertaking unless such undertaking fulfils all the following conditions, namely :\u2013\n(i) It is wholly owned by a public sector company or any other company in which a public sector company or companies hold at least forty-nine per cent of the voting rights;\n(ii) It is notified by the Central Government in this behalf on or before the 31-5-2008; and\n(iii) It begins refining not later than the 31st day of March, 2012.\"\n(iii) However, the above provisions of sub-section (9) of section 80-IB of the Act has been substituted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2009 with retrospective effect from 1-4-2000. Thus, section 80-IB(9) of the Act with retrospective effect from 1-4-2000 reads as under :\u2013\n\"(9) The amount of deduction to an undertaking shall be hundred percent of the profit for a period of seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial assessment year, if such undertaking fulfills any of the following, namely :\u2013\n(i) Is located in North Eastern Region and has begun or begins commercial production of mineral oil before the 1-4-1997.\n(ii) Is located in any part of India and has begun or begins commercial production of mineral oil on or after the 1-4-1997.\n(but not later than 31-3-2017); inserted by Finance Act, 2016, with effect from 1-4-2017)\n(Provided that the provisions of this clause shall not apply to blocks licensed under a contract awarded after the 31-3-2011 under the New Exploration Licencing Policy announced by the Government of India vide Resolution No. O19018\/22\/95-ONG.DO.VL, dated the 10-2-1999 or in pursuance of any law for the time being in force or by the Centre or a State Government in any other matter); inserted by Finance Act, 2011 with effect from 1-4-2012)\n(iii) Is engaged in refining of mineral oil and begins such refining on or after the 1-10-1998; but not later than the 31-3-2012.\n(iv) Is engaged in commercial production of natural gas in blocks licensed under the VIII Round of bidding for award of exploration contracts (hereinafter referred to as 'NELP-VIII') under the New Exploration Licencing Policy announced by the Government of India vide Resolution No. O-19018\/22\/95-ONG.VL, dated 10-2-1999 and begins commercial production of natural gas on or after the 1-4-2009.

Since the new MS Plant started commercial production from 25-7-2006 which is within the specified period and fulfills all the conditions, the assessee company, without prejudice, is entitled to deduction under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act.\nWe note the old section 80-IA of the Act, prior to its restructure into two parts, as section 80-IA and 80-IB by Finance Act, 1999, with effect from 1-4-2000, was inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991 with effect from 1-4-1991 and later on various amendments were made to the section. Sub-section (4E) was inserted by the Finance Act, 1997 which granted relief to undertaking which began commercial production of mineral oil in the North Eastern Region. Sub-section (4E) of section 80-IA inserted by Finance Act, 1997 with effect from 1-4-1998 reads as under :\u2013\n\"(4E) This section applies to any undertaking which begins commercial production of mineral oil in the North Eastern region.\"\nThe sub-section was further amended by the Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1998 with effect from 1-4-1998 and this sub-section was made applicable all over India and after the words \"North Eastern Region\", the words \"or in any part of India on or after the 1-4-1998\" were inserted.\nFurther amendments were made by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 and in sub-section (4E), after the words \"commercial production\", the words \"or refining\" were inserted and also the following proviso was inserted with effect from 1-4-1999 :\u2013\n\"Provided that the provisions of this section shall apply in case of refining of mineral oil where the undertaking begins refining on or after the 1-10-1998.\"\nThe issues of disputes in respect of the claim of the assessee are, (1) whether the raw material 'Naphtha' processed by the new unit falls within the definition of 'Mineral oil' and (2) whether the process of conversion of 'Naphtha' to gasoline and other products falls within the meaning of'refining'? We note that both the terms are not defined in section 80-IB(9) of the Act and hence the meaning of the words has to be derived from other sections of the Act, definitions given in other statutes and from common parlance meaning.\nNow we shall examine the term 'Mineral oil' which is defined by various Acts as under :\u2013\n(i) The term 'Mineral oil' is defined in section 42, section 44BB and section 293A of the Act and as per these sections; the term'mineral oil' includes petroleum and natural gas. Since,'mineral oil' is not defined in section 80-IB(9) of the Act, the definition in other part of the same Act can be imported to find out the true meaning of the definition.\n(ii) CBDT in their Circular No. 57, dated 23-3-1971 used the term'mineral oil' to cover both crude oil (crude petroleum) and liquid products derived from crude petroleum which are in the nature of mixture of the hydrocarbons, namely, motor spirit, kerosene and other allied articles.\n(iii) The Mines Act, 1952 defines'mineral' as 'all substances which can be obtained from the earth by mining digging, drilling, dredging, hydraulicing, quarrying or by any other operation and includes'mineral oil' (which in turn include natural gas and petroleum).\n(iv"}
{"text":") The Mine and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 defines by section 3(b), the term'mineral oil' to include petroleum and natural gas.\n(v) Section 3(h) of the Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974, defines'mineral oil' to include petroleum and natural gas.\n(vi) Under the Mines Act, 1952 in section 2(jj)'mineral' means substances which can be obtained from the earth by mining, digging, drilling, dredging, hydrolyzing, quarrying or by any other operation and includes mineral oil.\n(vii) The Oil Fields (Regulation & Development) Act, 1948 defines 'Mineral Oil' in section 3(c) as \"Mineral Oils\" include natural gas and petroleum.\nAt this juncture, it would be important to see the meaning of the words 'Petroleum', 'Petroleum Products' and 'Crude Oil' as these terms are associated with the definition of 'Mineral Oil'. The various Acts define these terms as follows :\u2013\n(i) The Petroleum Act, 1934 has defined Petroleum in section 2(a) as, 'Petroleum' means any liquid hydrocarbons or mixture of hydrocarbons and any inflammable mixture (liquid, viscous or solid) containing any liquid hydro-carbon.\n(ii) In the \"Petroleum and Carbide Manual\" issued by the Chief Inspector of Explosive of India in 1959, there is an opinion to the following effect :\u2013\n\"Comments by the Chief Inspector of Explosive.\u2013The following more common articles of commerce fall within the definition of 'petroleum' liquid hydrocarbons or mixture of hydrocarbons, asphalt, aviation spirit, benzene, benzene\u2026 ethyl, white oil, white spirit, xylene, xylol.\nInflammable mixture (liquid, viscas or solid ) containing liquid hydrocarbons (or acetone, wood naphtha or methyl alcohol), cellulose enamels, lacquers and paints cement (patent), cleaning soaps, metal polices, paint removers, rubber solution, thinner.\"\n(iii) Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959 defines Petroleum Product in Rule 3(n) as \"Petroleum Product\" means any commodity made from petroleum or natural gas and shall include refined crude oil, processed crude petroleum, residuum from crude petroleum, cracking stock, uncracked fuel oil, fuel oil, fuel oil, treated crude oil residuum, casing head gasoline, natural gas gasoline, naphtha, distillate, gasoline, waste oil, blended gasoline, lubricating oil, blends or mixture of oil with one or more liquid products or by-products derived from oil condensate, gas or petroleum hydrocarbons, whether herein enumerated or not\".\n(iv) The Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act, 1962 defines as :\u2013\nSection 2(c) \"Petroleum\" has the same meaning as in the Petroleum Act, 1934, and includes natural gas and refinery gas\".\n(v) The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974 defines 'Petroleum Product' as :\u2013\n2(m) \"petroleum product\" means any commodity made from petroleum or natural gas and includes refined crude oil, processed crude petroleum, residuum from crude petroleum, cracking stock, uncracked fuel oil, fuel oil, treated crude oil residuum, casing head gasoline, natural gas, gasoline, naphtha, distillate, gasoline, kerosene, bitumen, asphalt and tar, waste oil, blended gasoline, lubricating oil, blends or mixture of oil with one or more liquid products or by products derived from oil or gas and blends or mixture of two or more liquid products or by products derived from oil condensate and gas or petroleum hydrocarbon not specified herein before.\"\n(vi) The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974 has defined Crude Oil in section 2(e) as :\u2013\n\"Crude Oil\" means petroleum in its natural state before it is refined or otherwise treated but from which water and foreign substances have been extracted.\"\nNow coming to the meaning of 'Naphtha', it has been defined as under :\u2013\n(i) Naphtha is the first petroleum product produced during the distillation process and subsequently upgraded to make major components of gasoline.\n(ii) Naphtha consists in crude oil. According to Columbia Encyclopedia, naphtha, the term usually restricted to a class of colorless product obtained as one of the more volatile fraction in the crude (petroleum naphtha), in the fractional distillation of coal wood (wood naphtha).\n(iii) According to Wikipedia Encyclopedia, naphtha normally refer to a number of different flammable liquid mixtures of hydrocarbons, i.e. a distillation product from petroleum or coal tar boiling in a certain range and containing certain hydrocar"}
{"text":"bons, a broad term encompassing any volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Like many hydrocarbon products, they are product of a refinery process in which a complex soup of chemicals is broken into another range of chemicals which are then graded and isolated mainly by their specific gravity and volatility.\n(iv) The word naphtha came from Latin and Greek. It is an ancient Greek word that was used to refer to any sort of petroleum or pitch. It appears in Arabic as 'naft' and Hebrew as 'neft'. Arabic and Persian have used and distilled petroleum for tar and fuel from ancient times, as attested in local Greek and Roman histories of the region. In old en usage 'naphtha' simply means crude oil. The Ukrainian word and Russian word mean exactly 'crude oil'. Also in Italy, naphtha is colloquially used to indicate diesel fuel. There is a conjecture that the word 'naphtha' came (via Greek where it means any sort of petroleum) from Vedic God name ApamNapat.\n(v) In modern times, naphtha is obtained in petroleum refineries as one of the intermediate products from the distillation of crude oil. It is a liquid intermediate between the light gases in the crude oil and the heavier liquid kerosene. Naphthas are volatile, flammable and have a specific gravity of about 0.7. The generic name 'naphtha' describes a range of different refinery intermediate product used in different applications. To complicate the matter further, similar naphtha types are often referred to by different names. Naphtha is used primarily as 'feedstock' for producing a high octane gasoline component (via the catalytic reforming process). It is also used in the petrochemical industry for producing olefins in steam cracker and in the chemical industry for solvent (cleaning) applications.\n(vi) Petroleum naphtha is an intermediate hydrocarbon liquid stream derived from refining of crude. It is most usually desulfurized and then catalytically reformed, which rearranges or restructures the hydrogen molecules in the naphtha as well as breaking some of the molecules into smaller molecules to produce a high octane component of gasoline.\n(vii) There are quite literally hundreds of different petroleum crude oil sources world wide and eachcrude has its own unique composition or assay. There are also hundreds of petroleum refineries world wide and each one of them is designed to process either a specific crude oil or specific types of crude oil. That means that it is virtually impossible to provide a definitive, single definition of the word naphtha. In other words, naphtha is a 'generic term' rather than a'specific term'\n(viii) Again, Naphtha has been defined to fall within the meaning of\" petroleum product\" in section 2(m) by The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974.\n(ix) Naphtha has been defied in the Naphtha (Acquisition, sale, storage and Prevention of use in Automobiles) Order, 2000 in clause 2(5) as, \"Naphtha\" is a light hydrocarbon liquid with 90% volume distillation by ASTM D-86 distillation method of 190 degree Centigrade or less.\n(x) Reference is also made to the opinion of Indian Institute of Petroleum which was filed before the learned assessing officer to explain that naphtha is covered within the definition of'mineral oil'. The same was also referred to in written submissions filed before the learned Commissioner (Appeals). The Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) is one of the leading constituent laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) established in 1960. The Institute is devoted to multid is ciplinary areas of research and development in the downstream sector of hydrocarbon and related industry. The Institute undertakes R & D work in areas of petroleum, natural gas, alternative fuels, petrochemicals, utilization of petroleum products in I C Engines and in industrial and domestic combustion. The Institute also provides technical and analytical services to petroleum refinery and related industries including technology transfer for developing novel state of art technologies and product.\nThe Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) opined as under :\u2013\n\"As per technical and commercial understanding of the term 'Mineral' within the oil and gas industry, petroleum (which includes crude oil and petroleum products obtained there from) and natural gas can be categorized as 'Minerals'.\nConsidering the fact that both the input i.e. crude oil and the output i.e. petroleum products are 'Minerals' a refinery involved in refining of crude oil to produce petroleum products such as Naphtha, Motor Spirits, Aviation Turbine Fuel, Superior Kerosene Oil, High Speed Diesel etc. can be considered a 'Mineral based Industry'.\nIIP has relied upon various industry parlance, technical understanding, definitions and dictionary meaning of the term"}
{"text":" 'Mineral' to arrive at such an opinion. IIP, while giving such an opinion, have not taken cognizance of the interpretations given by any court of law on the subject and any definition in the tax laws. This opinion is purely guided by the technical and commercial understanding of the term 'Mineral' within the oil and gas industry.\"\nWe note that from the above definitions, it is abundantly clear that 'naphtha' is a 'petroleum product' or 'petroleum' and as 'petroleum' and 'petroleum product' fall within the definition of'mineral oil', therefore the assessee company is, entitled to benefit of deduction under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act.\nWe note that learned Commissioner (Appeals) also mentioned in his consolidated appellateOrder, dated 8-10-2013 for the Assessment years 2007-08 to 2010-11 in page 9 in first para that, 'Naphtha, after all is not petroleum but it is a petroleum product made by refining of crude petroleum oil'. As the learned Commissioner (Appeals) accepted 'Naphtha' as a 'petroleum product', the assessee company is entitled to deduction under section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act following various definitions referred to herein above. We note that for the assessment year 2007-08, the learned assessing officer accepted the same when he mentioned in para 17.08 in page 10 of the assessment order that\". Naphtha is nothing but a petroleum product produced from crude oil.\" When crude petroleum oil itself is not to be considered as'mineral oil'; Naphtha being a product of refining of crude petroleum oil can much less be said to be included in'mineral oil'.\" It is abundantly clear from the orders of the learned assessing officer as well as from the consolidated appeal order of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) that conclusions were drawn based on para 19.1 of the Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 where it is mentioned that. \"For the purpose of this section, the term'mineral oil', does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the Income Tax Act\".\nAs we stated earlier that the term'mineral oil' has not been defined in section 80-IB(9) of the Act. Hence, the meaning of the term has to be derived from the meaning given in other sections of the Act, other statutory definition given in other Acts and technical and commercial use of the term in related industries. There is no restriction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act that the meaning of the term cannot be imported from other statutes or from the technical or commercial definition available in the industry or common parlance meaning. Normally, when the intention of Legislature is to give a narrow meaning of any term in the Act, restriction forms part of the section or a deeming fiction is created in the section. However, no such intention is found in section 80-IB(9) of the Act and hence meaning of the term'mineral oil' has to be wide and the same cannot be restricted to the meaning given in para 19.1 of Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009. We have mentioned above paras of this order, the meaning of'mineral oil', 'petroleum', 'petroleum product' in different statutes, which clearly justify that 'Naphtha' will fall within the definition of'mineral oil'. The learned assessing officer as well as Id Commissioner (Appeals) even admitted that 'Naphtha' is a 'Petroleum Product'. It seems both the authorities below could not accept the contention of the assessee because of para 19.1 of Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 which excluded even 'Petroleum and Natural Gas' from the meaning of'mineral oil'.\nWe note that the opinion of the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) was filed before the learned assessing officer and the same was also mentioned in the submission before the learned Commissioner (Appeals). The learned assessing officer held that the opinion did not consider interpretation given by Court of law or any definition in tax law. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) did not consider the same. The authorities below did not consider any interpretation given by law and concluded the issue based onCircular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 of the CBDT.\nIt is well settled that Circular issued by CBDT is not binding on any court of law or on an assessee. The opinion of the IIP was based on technical and commercial understanding of the meaning of'mineral oil' followed in Oil and Gas Industries in the Country and such opinion must be followed in defining the term 'Mineral Oil' in tax laws. Thus, we note that the finding of the authorities below, was based on the Circular 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009. However, intention of the Legislature does not"}
{"text":" go with the meaning of 'Mineral Oil' given in the Circular. Where the intention of the Legislature is to expand the meaning of the words 'Mineral oil', CBDT has given a narrow and restrictive meaning to the words.\nWe note that Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 was issued explaining the provisions of Finance Act, 2008. Section 80-IB(9) was amended by Finance Act, 2008 by making a sun set provision that where an undertaking is engaged in refining of mineral oil, it should begin refining on or after 1-10-1998 with a rider that where such undertaking begins refining of mineral oil on or after 1-4-2009, such undertaking must fulfill the conditions that (a) it is a public sector company or any company in which a public sector company or companies hold at least 49% of the voting rights, (b) it is notified by the Central Government in this behalf on or before 31-5-2008 and (c) it begins refining not later than 31-3-2012. Thus, section 80-IB(9) was amended to disallow benefit to undertakings if it does not begin refining of mineral oil on or before 1-4-2009 and a concession was given to the public sector and other companies in which public sector companies hold 49% of the voting rights with notification by the Central Government who could avail the benefit of section 80-IB(9) if it begins refining of mineral oil on or before 31-3-2012. It clearly shows that benefits were extended to public sector and specific companies which could not begin refining of mineral oil till 1-4-2009. Thus, scope of section 80-IB(9) was extended to public sector and specific companies by the amendment in Finance Act, 2008. The meaning of the term'mineral oil' was not restricted by the amendment in Finance Act, 2008 in section 80-IB(9) of the Act. In para 19.1 of the Circular No. 1, dated 27-3-2009, while explaining the Finance Act, 2008, CBDT opined that the term'mineral oil' does not include petroleum and natural gas. The said Circular was issued on 27-3-2009 explaining the provisions of Finance Act, 2008. It appears that the Revenue through the Circular tried to force its view on the assessee without considering the intention of the Legislature to provide relief to public sector and specific company owned refineries. It shows that spirit of the amended provisions was not reflected in para 19.1 of the Circular No. 1\/2009. The assessee is a public sector undertaking and its M S Plant began refining in the Financial Year 2006-07, relevant to assessment year 2007-08. Thus, the assessee company began refining before 1-4-2009 and it did not require special concession introduced in the amendment in section 80-IB(9) of the Act by Finance Act, 2008. However, no restriction should be imposed on the assessee company where its claim is allowable within normal provisions of section 80-IB(9) without special attention. Thus, para 19.1 of Circular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 is contrary to the intention of the Legislature as it restrict the scope of section 80-IB(9) rather than giving concession to public sector and specific companies in the amended section.\nWe note thatCircular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 had created a lot of controversy. Therefore, at this juncture it is relevant to note the extracts from the speech of the Finance Minister to the debate in the Lok Sabha on 29-4-2009 on Finance Bill, 2008, which is given below :\u2013\n\"11. Some concerns have been expressed regarding the scope of section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act. As Honourable Members are aware, this sub section allows 100 per cent tax exemption in respect of an undertaking which begins 'commercial production or refining of mineral oil for a period of seven consecutive assessment years. The scope of this section is under adjudication since assessment year 2001-02 before different tax authorities. In my view, we should allow the disputed issues to be resolved in the normal course by the tribunals and courts. Nevertheless, I wish to clarify certain doubt that may have arisen because of the 'Notes on Clauses' attached to the Finance Bill. The statement in the Notes on clauses is a mere re-statement of the Income Tax Department's known position before the Tribunals\/Courts which are adjudicating the matter. Besides, it is well settled proposition of law that Notes on clauses have no legal effect and are not binding on the courts. I may assure the potential bidders that the benefit of section 80-IB(9), as finally interpreted by the courts, will be applicable to all exploration and production contracts, whether obtained through nomination or bidding.\"\nIt is well settled that Speech made by the Finance Minister at the Parliament may be used"}
{"text":" in interpreting the meaning of the words used in the Act. Reference may be made to the decision of K.P. Varghese v. ITO (1981) 131 ITR 597 (SC) : 1981 TaxPub(DT) 0972 (SC) where the H'ble Supreme Court has held that Speech made by the Finance Minister while moving the amendment is extremely relevant. It is held that this speech made by the mover of the bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the bill can certainly be referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and the object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (2003) 259 ITR 51 (SC) : 2003 TaxPub(DT) 0669 (SC) has held that the Finance Minister's Speech can be relied upon to throw light on the object and purpose of the particular provisions introduced by the Finance bill. Moreover, if petroleum is not included in the meaning of'mineral oil', there was no reason to extend concession to public sector companies till 31-3-2012. The speech of the Hon'ble Finance minister shows that the contents of the 'Notes on Clauses' are mere restatement of the positions of the Income Tax Department and the same cannot be binding on Courts and Tribunals. Hence, the Circular is not sacrosanct and it is not binding on the assessee company. The interpretation given by the Tribunals and the Courts will only be binding.\nThe following is the extract from the reply of the Hon'ble Finance Minister to the debate in the Lok Sabha on 29-4-2008, on Finance Bill, 2008 :\u2013\n\"10. Sir, clause 15 of the Finance Bill, 2008 seeks to insert a new proviso in sub section (9) of section 80-IB so as to provide that no deduction shall be allowed to an undertaking engaged in refining of mineral oil, if it begins refining on or after 1-4-2009. Consequent to this proposal, three public sector refineries under construction in Paradeep, Bina and Bathinda may not complete before 1-4-2009. With a view to ensuring that the benefit to these refineries is not denied on account of their inability to adhere to this deadline, it is proposed to amend the proposal to provide that such refineries would be eligible to avail of the benefit if they begin refining not later than 31-3-2010.\"\nFollowing the statement of the Hon'ble Finance Minister in the LokSabha, vide Notification No. 66 of 2008, dated 30-5-2008, eight mineral based refineries were notified by the Central Government for the purpose of section 80-IB(9). A perusal of the processes of these refineries clearly shows that their processes are similar to the process employed by the MS Plant of the assessee. The Panipat Refinery Complex of IOC is a Naphtha cracker & downstream polymer unit (naphtha Cracker Unit). The Paradip Refinery has a 10000 bpd diesel hydrotreater, a 8,000 bpd naphtha hydrotreater and 10000 alkalination unit. The Bina Refinery has also commissioned a naphtha hydrotreater and a continuous catalyst reformer. Thus, the intention of the Legislature is clearly manifested in this notification and as the raw material and the processes of these refineries are similar to the raw material and processes employed by the MS Plant of the assessee company, there is no justification on the part of the learned assessing officer to deny the benefit of section 80-IB(9) to the MS Plant of the assessee company where the Central Government has notified these refineries to be eligible to get benefit under section 80-IB(9). If the intention of the amendment of section 80-IB(9) was to restrict the meaning of the term'mineral oil', there was no reason to notify Eight Refineries akin to the new MS Plant of the assessee company to avail benefit of section 80-IB(9) of the Act till 31-3-2012. We note that based on the reasons stated above, the assessee is entitled to benefit of section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act.\nWe note that section 80-IB(9) was again amended by Finance (No. 2) Act,2009 with effect from 1-4-2000 and restrictions put by Finance Act, 2008 were removed. The only conditions under section 80-IB(9)(iii) is that the undertaking is engaged in refining of mineral oil and begins such refining on or after 1-10-1998 but not later than 31-3-2012. Again, the amendment has been made retrospective from 1-4-2000. This clearly shows that the scope of section 80-IB(9) of the Act has been extended by the Finance (No. 2) Act,2009 and benefit extended to Public"}
{"text":" Sector Companies in Finance Act, 2008 is also available to other companies with effect from 1-4-2000. AsCircular No. 1\/2009, dated 27-3-2009 was issued to explain the provisions of Finance Act, 2008 and para 19.1 explained scope of section 80-IB(9) of the Act, after the amendment of section 80-IB(9) of the Act by the Finance (No. 2) Act,2009, such narrow explanation of the Circular does not hold good. As the scope of section 80-IB(9) has become wider and conditions put by Finance Act, 2008 were removed, the contents of the Circular No. 1\/2009 in para 19.1 has also become ineffective. Hence, meaning enunciated by para 19.1 of the Circular does not hold good with effect from 1-4-2000. Moreover, scope of section 80-IB(9) has also been extended to production of natural gas in blocks licensed under the VIII Round of bidding in NELP-VIII by insertion of para (iv) in section 80-IB(9) of the Act by Finance (No. 2) Act, 2009 with effect from 1-4-2010. When the scope of the section 80-IB(9) has been made wider, there was no justification in following a narrower meaning enunciated by the Circular, that too, explaining the scope of the Finance Act, 2008 where the required conditions for section 80-IB(9) to be followed were removed. Thus, there is an enlargement of the benefits under the provisions of section 80-IB(9) and restrictive meaning given by the Circular does not hold good if the Gold en Rule of Interpretation is considered. Therefore, there is no justification of giving narrower meaning of the words'mineral oil'. For that we rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Burmah Refineries Ltd. (1966) 61 ITR 493 (Bom) : 1966 TaxPub(DT) 0361 (Bom-HC) wherein the court was construing the meaning of the expression'mineral oil' in a different context, actually, the decision fully supports the stand taken by the assessee company. The Hon'ble High Court categorically observed in page 501 (from 501 to 503 discussed) of the order that, \" it is clear that the expression'mineral oil' is wide enough to include both, the petroleum in its crude form as well as the product secured or obtained from the crude oil by refining. In this case, the Revenue contended that the petitioner company was not a company engaged in the manufacture or production of mineral oil. On the other hand, it is contended that the petitioner company is a company doing business of refining crude oil. The argument of the Revenue was that the expression 'Mineral Oil' means crude oil and not its product\". In para 9 of the order, the Hon'ble High Court observed that the expression 'Mineral Oil' has not been defined anywhere in the Act. The Hon'ble High Court discussed the meaning of 'Mineral Oil' in para 10, which is given as under :\u2013\n\"We have already stated that the combined effect of various provisions of the Act to which we have already made reference is that if the company is engaged in doing business of manufacturing or production of mineral oil, then it is entitled to 35 per cent rebate. We have referred to the meaning given to the term 'Mineral Oil' and 'Crude Oil' in the aforesaid dictionaries which indicates that the crude oil means petroleum in its raw form as it comes from the ground and the expression 'Mineral Oil' is wide enough to include both petroleum as well as the product produced from petroleum by refining or the products secured from raw petroleum or crude oil. Prima facie, the company appears to have been engaged in the business of manufacturing or production of mineral oil.\"\nFurther in the case of Add. CIT v. Distillers Trading Corporation Ltd. (1982) 137 ITR 894 (Del) : 1982 TaxPub(DT) 0733 (Del-HC), the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has observed in para 5 of the order that :\u2013\n\"The AAC pointed out that the term 'Mineral Oil' covers both crude oil and liquid products derived from liquid petroleum which are in the nature of mixture of hydrocarbons such as motor spirit, aviation kerosene and other allied articles. In order to find out whether ethyl alcohol was a mineral oil, it is necessary to see whether this product comes within the meaning of the word petroleum. The AAC referred to the definition of 'petroleum' under the Petroleum Act, 1934, and the Inflammable Substances Act, 1952, and, reading the two provision together came to the conclusion that ethyl alcohol was 'petroleum' within the meaning of Petroleum Act.\"\nSimilarly, in case of Indian Oil Corporation v. DCIT (2005"}
{"text":") 4 SOT 1 (Mum) : 2005 TaxPub(DT) 1678 (Mum-Trib) the Coordinate Bench of Mumbai Tribunal has held that petroleum products manufactured by the assessee, namely, naphtha, diesel and fuel oil fall under the expression'mineral oil' and do not qualify for deduction under section 80HHC. Though the decision was relating to section 80HHC, the Tribunal discussed the meaning of'mineral oil' which is also not defined in section 80HHC.\nWe note that Circular issued by CBDT cannot restrict a statutory interpretation. The interpretation as enunciated by Tribunals and Courts cannot be overwritten by a Circular. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case ofHindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. CIT (2000) 243 ITR 808 (SC) : 2000 TaxPub(DT) 1379 (SC) has held that Circulars or Instructions given by the Board are no doubt binding in law on the authorities under the Act, but when the Supreme Court or the high Court has declared the law on the question arising consideration, it will not be open to a court to direct that a circular should be given effect to and not the view expressed in a decision of the Supreme Court or the High Court. The Apex Court in case of Keshavji Ravji & Co. v. CIT (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC) : 1990 TaxPub(DT) 0934 (SC) has observed in para 13 of the order that the Board cannot pre-empta judicial interpretation of the scope and ambit of a provision of the Act by issuing Circulars on the subject. This is too obvious a proposition to require any argument for it. A circular cannot even impose on the tax payer a burden higher than what the Act itself, on a true interpretation envisages. The task of interpretation of law is the exclusive domain of the courts. The Tribunal, much less the High Court, is an authority under the Act. The Circulars do not bind them. But the benefits of such Circulars to assessee have been held to be permissible even though the Circulars might have departed from the strict tenor of the statutory provisions and mitigated the rigour of the law. But that is not the same thin gas saying that such circulars would either have binding effect in the interpretation of the provisions itself or that the Tribunal and the High Court are supposed to interpret the law in the light of the Circular. The Apex Court in case of Kerala Financial Corporation v. CIT (1994) 210 ITR 129 (SC) : 1994 TaxPub(DT) 1180 (SC) has observed that circulars, orders, instruction or direction of the Board cannot override the provisions of the Act; that would be destructive of all known principles of law as the same would really amount to giving power to delegated authority to even amend the provisions of law enacted by Parliament. Such a contention cannot seriously be even raised. In case of Madura Chit & Investment (P) Ltd. v. ITO (1994) 208 ITR 228 (Mad) : 1994 TaxPub(DT) 0930 (Mad-HC) it is held that instructions and Guidelines cannot override the specific provision of the Income Tax Act. In case of CIT v. Sirpur Paper Mills (1999) 237 ITR 41 (SC) : 1999 TaxPub(DT) 1227 (SC) and CIT v. Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (2001) 252 ITR 576 (Bom) : 2001 TaxPub(DT) 0320 (Bom-HC) it is held that notification issued by the CBDT cannot curtail the scope of deduction granted by the Income Tax Act. In case of Associated Cement Co Ltd. v. CIT (1994) 210 ITR 69 (Bom) : 1994 TaxPub(DT) 0895 (Bom-HC) it is held that the memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Act or the Circular of the Board cannot be used to curtail or modify the clear meaning of an expression used in the Statute. Thus, a Circular cannot override the provision of law. For that we rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Banque Nationle de Paris v. CIT (1999) 237 ITR 518 (Bom) : 1999 TaxPub(DT) 1187 (Bom-HC).\nFurther, our view is fortified by the recent Judgment of the Coordinate Bench of Guwahati in the case ofACIT v. Oil India Ltd., in ITA No. 120 to 123\/Gau\/2008, for assessment year 2003-04 to 2006-07, Order, dated 28-8-2019, wherein, identical facts, it was held as follows :\u2013\n\"23. We further notice after a deeper scrutiny that the assessee's main produce \"crude oil\" is treated as"}
{"text":" interchangeable to mineral oil including Natural Gas and Petroleum as per section 3(c) of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (No. 53 of 1948) or the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act 1969 (No. 30 of 1969). Section 42 read with its Explanation, section 44BB Explanation (ii) and section 293A Explanation (a) also define \"mineral oil\" as having the very inclusive meaning. We observe in this backdrop that the assessee is engaged in a \"mineral based industry\" as per the foregoing clinching expression employed as in 14th Schedule.\nThe Revenue's case that this crude oil production does not amount to mineral based industry as per item No. 16 in 14th Schedule of the Act carries no substance since the above stated expression has to be construed in ordinary connotation without having regard the further classification of minerals, i.e., ferrous or nonferrous and metallic or non-metallic etc.\nWe also wish to make it clear that there is further no dispute about the impugned statutory provision requiring in assessee to maintain its books of accountquaeach undertaking to be treated as separate unit in section 80-IC(7) of the Act incorporating the very legislative intent as is there in section 80-IB(13) (supra).\nThe Revenue's last argument is that assessee's oil exploration activity cannot be taken \"manufacture or production\" as prescribed in sec. 80-IC(2)(b) of the Act. Hon'ble Apex Court's landmark judgment inCIT v. N.C. Budharaja and Co. and another (1993) 204 ITR 412 (SC) : 1993 TaxPub(DT) 1502 (SC)held long back that the statutory expression \"produce\" has wider connotation than the word \"manufacture\". The former; when used in juxtaposition with the latter, brings into existence new goods by a process which may or may not amount to manufacture. And that the same also includes in all the by products; intermediary or residuary Hon'ble Delhi High Court's decision in HLS India Ltd. (supra) also hold s that whether or not any particular business activity amounts to manufacture or production for the purpose of various incentives schemes under the Act is required to be examined in the light of facts and circumstances in each case. These can be no denial of the fact that crude oil contains hydrocarbons as paraffin, cycloparaffin, napthene and araomaticcomprcands which is obtained from beneath the earth's surface. We reiterate that this assessee admittedly drills\/explores crude oil for the purpose of refining the same to various by-products. This we thus conclude that assessee's crude oil exploration very much amounts to production going by the relevant facts in the light of the preceding legal position. The Revenue's instant last argument is also rejected. We hold that Commissioner (Appeals) has rightly granted section 80-IC(2)(b) deduction to the taxpayer in assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07. The Revenue's two corresponding appeal(s) ITA No. 122 and 123\/Gau\/2018 also fails.\nNext comes the assessee's four appeal(s)ITA No. 87\/Gau\/2010, 33\/Gau\/2018, 325\/Gau\/2013 & 09\/Gau\/2014relevant to assessment year(s) 2007-08 to 2010-11; respectively. Learned representatives inform us very fairly that the lower authorities' have declined the assessee's section 80-IC(2)(b) deduction claims in these four years. The Commissioner (Appeals) has identically held that it ought to have raised its claim under section 80-IB(9) of the Act. The assessee has pleaded its identical additional ground therefore seeking to claim the impugned deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act. We conclude in this factual backdrop that our findings holding it eligible for section 80-IC deduction for assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07 would apply mulatis mulandis in these four latter assessment year(s) as well. Its additional ground is therefore rendered infructuous. Both the lower authorities action denying Revenue's section 80-IC(2)(iii) deduction involving varying sum (supra) stands reversed. The assessee succeeds in its instant four appeal(s) in above terms.\"\nTherefore, the meaning of'mineral oil' deserved to be considered in a wider manner. Moreover, the meaning of refining should be construed in the context of a refinery and it should not be restricted to simple purification process as opined by the learned assessing officer and upheld by the learned Commissioner (Appeals). The learned assessing officer and the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has held that 'Naphtha', the raw material used by the MS Plant is a 'Petroleum Product'. The 'Mineral oil' would include petroleum and petroleum"}
{"text":" products. Moreover, the MS Plant of the assessee company is engaged in processes which fall within the meaning of'refining', if the intention of the Legislature is considered. Thus, the MS Plant of the assessee company is an undertaking engaged in refining of mineral oil and fulfills all the conditions of section 80-IB(9)(iii) of the Act, as a result of which the assessee company is entitled to benefit of section 80-IB(9)(iii) consecutively for seven assessment years starting from assessment year 2007-08. Based on these facts and circumstances, we direct the assessing officer to allow deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act, for the Seven assessment years 2007-08 to 2013-14.\nCommon Ground No. 2 raised by the assessee reads as follows :\u2013\nGround No. (4) for the Assessment Year 2008-09; 351,28,35,732\nWe have already adjudicated the issue of the assessee company relating to deduction under section 80-IB(9) of the Act in para No. 4 to 17 of this order. We note that assessee company claimed benefit under section 80-IB((9) of the Act from assessment years 2001 to 2007-08 for the original plant. The assessee company found that entitled to under section 80-IC(2)(b)(iii) of the Act, for ten assessment years as all the conditions contained in the section were fulfilled by it. Since, the company availed deduction of 100% of its profit under section 80-IB(9) of the Act for seven years, the assessee company claimed deduction under section 80-IC for balance three assessment years starting from assessment year 2008-09. We have already explained the meaning of'mineral' in para No. 4 to 17 of this order, therefore, we do not repeat the same.\nUnder section 80-IC(2)(iii), a 100% deduction from the profit of an assessee is allowed if the gross total income of the assessee includes profit of an undertaking producing article specified in Fourteenth Schedule subject to certain conditions. Section 80-IC is a special provision in respect of certain undertakings or enterprises in certain special categories states. The intention of the legislation is clear that certain underdeveloped states should be developed to the extent of national level for which special benefit is given to new undertaking in those states under the provisions of the Act. We note that assessee company has satisfied the conditions of section 80-IC(2)(b)(iii) of the Act, therefore, entitled to claim deduction under section 80-IC(2)(b)(iii) of the Act.\nIt is well settled that that the beneficial provisions should be liberally construed while interpreting taxing statute. Since, section 80-IC is a beneficial provision giving incentives to specified industries in specific states, it has to be interpreted liberally to achieve the objectives for the purpose for which it was enacted. We have relied on a number of decisions, while adjudicating the issue relating to 80-IB(9) of the Act that beneficial provisions should be liberally interpreted and such decisions will also be applicable to section 80-IC of the Act. From the facts and issue of law, it is clear that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) is not justified in upholding the decision of the learned assessing officer is disallowing the benefit of section 80-IC of the Act to the assessee company for the assessment years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. We direct the assessing officer to allow the deduction under section 80-IC(2)(b)(iii) of the Act, for the assessment years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11.\nCommon ground No. 3 raised by the assessee is as follows :\u2013\nWe note that Ground No. (1) for the assessment year 2007-08, Ground No. (1) for the assessment year 2008-09 and Ground No. (5) for the assessment year 2012-13 are against disallowance of claim of deduction of expenses under the head 'Prior Period Expenses'. Brief factsqua the issue are that from the Tax audit Report under section 44AB of the Act, the learned assessing officer observed that the Tax Auditor had certified that an amount of Rs. 77,14,27,745 had been debited in the Profit and loss account under the head 'Prior Period Expenses'. The relevant portion of the Report 'Annexure-V' which is Schedule W of the Report of Tax Auditor has been incorporated in Para 5 of the Assessment order. From the Schedule-W, the learned assessing officer observed that the assessee credited Rs. 8,37,58,169 on account of purchase for resale and other operating and administrative expenses and debited Rs. 85,51,85,914 on account of sale of products, raw material consumed and depreciation, effecting net debit to the profit and loss at Rs. 77,14,27,745. The learned"}
{"text":" assessing officer further observed that Sale of Product of Rs. 8,81,913, Raw Materials Consumed worth Rs. 2,28,13,514 and depreciation amounting to Rs. 83,14,90,487 relates to earlier years, but debited in the accounts during the assessment year 2007-08. The learned assessing officer asked for an explanation for the amounts debited to profit and loss account and reply of the assessee company is also incorporated in the assessment order. The assessee company explained the facts and also submitted that Prior period depreciation of Rs. 83,14,90,487 has already been added in computation of income. The learned assessing officer was of the view that under the Scheme of the Act, tax is levied on the income of the previous year. The learned assessing officer considered the issue in para 5 to 7 of his assessment Order, dated 29-12-2009 for the assessment year 2007-08. As mentioned in para 7 of the assessment order, the learned assessing officer held that in mercantile system of accounting, only income that has accrued during the previous year and the expenses incurred during the said period can only be considered in the taxable income. Hence, the learned assessing officer disallowed prior period expenses being Sale of Product of Rs. 8,81,913 and Raw Materials Consumed amounting to Rs. 2,28,13,514; in total Rs. 2,36,95,427 (Rs. 8,81,913 + Rs. 2,28,13,514) debited to profit and loss Account.\nAggrieved by the order of assessing officer, the assessee carried the matter in appeal before the learned Commissioner (Appeals), who has confirmed the addition made by the assessing officer. Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us.\nWe have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record, we note that in para 7 of the assessment order, the learned assessing officer held that under scheme of the Act, tax is levied on income of the previous year. In mercantile system of accounting, only the income that has accrued during the previous year and the expenses incurred during the said period can only be considered in computing the taxable income of a particular previous year, each year being a separate self contained unit of assessment. Hence, the learned assessing officer disallowed prior period expenses.\nWe note that in mercantile system of accounting, an assessee had not earlier debited his account with the expenditure which accrued in law in an earlier year, would not, in the absence of a barring provisions under the law, disentitle to debit his account later when an enforceable demand is made by the appropriate authority. There is no express bar in law which disallows expenditure relating to a period other than the previous year. For that we rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court in case of CIT v. Nathmal Tolaram (1973) 88 ITR 234 (Gau) : 1973 TaxPub(DT) 0241 (Gau-HC). Further, the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in case of Saurashtra Cement & Chemical Industries Ltd. v. CIT (1995) 213 ITR 523 (Guj) : 1995 TaxPub(DT) 0614 (Guj-HC) has held that if any liability though relating to the earlier year, depends upon making a demand and its acceptance by the assessee and such liability has been actually claimed and paid in the later previous years, cannot be disallowed as deduction merely on the basis that the accounts are maintained on mercantile basis and that it related to a transaction of the previous year. In case of CIT v. Jatia Manufacturing Investment Co. (P) Ltd. (1983) 142 ITR 536 (Cal) : 1983 TaxPub(DT) 0630 (Cal-HC) it is held that liability to pay interest to creditors having arisen or accrued to the assessee only on the final rejection of its request for waiver of interest in the previous year relevant year to assessment year 1970-71, the interest was an allowable expenses for assessment year 1970-71. In CIT v. Khaitan Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited (2008) 307 ITR 150 (Del) : 2008 TaxPub(DT) 2311 (Del-HC), the Hon'ble High Court has observed that Accounting Standard (AS-5) stipulates that prior period items are income or expenses which arise 'in the current period' as a result of errors or omissions in the preparation of the financial statements of one or more prior periods. Therefore, incomes or expenses relatable to prior period items are those which arise in the current period i.e. the period relevant for the purposes of computing the net profit or loss. Prior period items are to be included in the determination of the net profit or loss.\nRespectfully following the above cited judgments we allow Ground No. (1) for the assessment year 2007-08"}

The brief factsqua the issue are that for the assessment year 2007-08, the assessee claimed deduction of Rs. 1,00,22,722 being provisions for retiring benefits of employees, in computation of income under the general provisions of the Act as well as in determining income under section 115JB of the Act, which was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The learned assessing officer added the amounts both in computation of income under general provisions of the Act as well as in determining of income under section 115JB of the Act holding that the amounts are not ascertained liabilities. The learned assessing officer considered the issue in para 9 to 12 (In page 5 and 6) of his Order, dated 29-12-2009. Before the learned Commissioner (Appeals), the assessee raised two grounds, namely Ground No. (3) for addition of Rs. 1,00,22,722 made under the general provisions of the Act and Ground No. (7) for addition of Rs. 1,00,22,722 made in determining book profit under section 115JB of the Act.\nFor the assessment year 2008-09, the assessee claimed deduction of Rs. 1,02,74,000 being provisions for retiring benefits of employees, in computation of income under the general provisions of the Act as well as in determining income under section 115JB of the Act, which was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The learned assessing officer added the amount in computation of income under general provisions of the Act holding that the amount is not an ascertained liability. However, the learned assessing officer did not compute income under section 115JB of the Act as income under the general provisions of the Act was on the higher side and book profit as shown by the assessee was taken in the assessment order. The learned assessing officer considered the issue in para 8 and 9 (page 5) of his Order, dated 23-12-2010. Hence, only Ground no. (2) was taken before the learned Commissioner (Appeals) against additions of Rs. 1,02,74,000 under the general provision of the Act.\nFor the assessment year 2009-10, the assessee claimed deduction of Rs. 97,67,000 being provisions for resettlement benefits of employees, in computation of income under the general provisions of the Act as well as in determining income under section 115JB of the Act, which was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The learned assessing officer added the amount in computation of income under general provisions of the Act holding that the amount is not an ascertained liability. However, the learned assessing officer did not compute income under section 115JB of the Act as income under the general provisions of the Act was on the higher side and book profit as shown by the assessee was taken in the assessment order. The learned assessing officer considered the issue in para 5.0 to 5.03 (page 2 to 4) of his Order, dated 23-12-2011. Hence, only Ground no. (1) was taken before the learned Commissioner (Appeals) against additions of Rs. 97,67,000 under general provisions of the Act.\nFor the assessment year 2010-11, the assessee claimed deduction of Rs. 8,37,000 being provisions for re-settlement benefits of employees, in computation of income under the general provisions of the Act as well as in determining income under section 115JB of the Act, which was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The learned assessing officer added the amount in computation of income under general provisions of the Act holding that the amount is not an ascertained liability. However, the learned assessing officer did not compute income under section 115JB of the Act as income under the general provisions of the Act was on the higher side and book profit as shown by the assessee was taken in the assessment order. The learned assessing officer considered the issue in para 05.00 to 05.2.1 (page 4 to 6) of his Order, dated 30-11-2012. Hence, only Ground no. (2) was taken before the learned Commissioner (Appeals) against additions of Rs. 8,37,000 under the general provisions of the Act.\nAggrieved by the order of the assessing officer, the assessee carried the matter in appeal before the learned Commissioner (Appeals"}
{"text":") who has confirmed the addition made by the assessing officer. Aggrieved, the assessee is in further appeal before us.\nWe have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record, we note that for the assessment year 2007-08, the assessee submitted that as the amounts were arrived at based on actuarial valuation, the same are ascertained liability and the amount should be allowed while computing book profit under section 115JB of the Act. The submission of the assessee is included in the Paper Book for the assessment year 2007-08 in para 10 in page 53 to 60. For the assessment year 2008-09, the assessee made submissions that provisions for retirement benefit of Rs. 1,02,74,000 should be allowed as the same was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The submission of the assessee is included in the Paper Book for the assessment year 2008-09 in para 5 in page Nos. 34 to 38.For the assessment year 2009-10, the assessee made submissions that provisions for resettlement benefit of Rs. 97,67,000 should be allowed as the same was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The submission of the assessee is included in the Paper Book for the assessment year 2009-10 in para 4 in page 31 to 36. For the assessment year 2010-11, the assessee made submissions that provisions for resettlement benefit of Rs. 8,37,000 should be allowed as the same was arrived at based on actuarial valuation. The submission of the assessee is included in the Paper Book for the assessment year 2010-11 in para 6 in page 29 to 34.\nWe note that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) decId ed the issues in para (F) in page 7 of his consolidated Order, dated 8-10-2013. The Commissioner (Appeals) allowed the grounds partly by directing the learned assessing officer to verify the actual sums debited to the Profit and Loss Account based on actuarial and consider such amounts as ascertained liability. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) followed the order of his predecessor in Appeal No. Guwa\/223\/2006-07, dated 22-6-2007 for the assessment year 2004-05. An apparent mistake was corrected and a rectification order by the learned Commissioner (Appeals) was passed on 28-2-2014 and ground no. (1) for the assessment year 2009-10 was taken into account in para (F) of his order. However, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) in para (F) of the consolidated order considered the issue as whether'retirement benefit for employees' is to be added to book profit for the purpose of section 115JB of the Act and followed the appeal order of his predecessor where the decisions of Apex Court in case of Metal Box Co. of India v. Their Workmen (1969) 73 ITR 53 (SC) : 1969 TaxPub(DT) 0152 (SC) and Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. v. CIT (2000) 245 ITR 428 (SC) : 2000 TaxPub(DT) 1505 (SC) were followed. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) directed the learned assessing officer to verify the actual sums debited to P &L account based on actuarial valuation and to consider the amount as ascertained liability. He also stated that the assessing officer would re-compute the book profit under section 115JB of the Act in accordance with the direction.\nHowever, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) did not mention that such ascertained liability should also be deducted in computation of income under the general provisions of the Act. Thus, the learned Commissioner (Appeals), in effect, only considered the Ground No. (7) for the assessment year 2007-08 which is related to allowability of deduction of'retirement benefit for employees' in determining book profit under section 115JB of the Act. As stated para 5.1 to 5.5 hereinabove, the assessee company had another Ground (3) for the assessment year 2007-08, Ground No. (2) for the assessment year 2008-09, Ground No. (1) for the assessment year 2009-10 and Ground No. (2) for the assessment year 2010-11 relating to deduction of 'Retirement Benefit for Employees' under general provisions of the Act and the learned Commissioner (Appeals) inadvertently did not address the same in his consolidated order though he agreed with the contention of the assessee company that amounts based on actuarial valuation will be treated as ascertained liability and held that third and Seventh Grounds for the assessment year 2007-08, Second ground for the assessment year 2008-09, First ground for the assessment year 2009-10 and Second Ground for the assessment year 2010-11 are partly allowed for statistical purposes.\nWe note that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) in para 6 in page 4 and 5 of his appealOrder No. Guwa-255\/2015-16\/128, dated 6-7-2016 for the assessment year 2011"}
{"text":"-12 has held that provisions of resettlement benefit arrived at based on actuarial valuation is allowable deduction and the same is not hit by the provisions of section 43B of the Act.

Therefore, respectfully following the judgment of the Coordinate Bench in case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (supra), we direct the assessing officer to allow provisions of post- retirement benefits based on actuarial valuation as expense under section 37(1) of the Act, after due verification and in accordance to law.\nCommon ground No. 5 raised by assessee reads as follows :\u2013\nGround No. (5) for the assessment year 2007-08, Ground No. (5) for the assessment year 2008-09, Ground No. (6) for the assessment year 2009-10 are against rejection of additional grounds raised before the learned Commissioner (Appeals) regarding claim of deduction of expenditure on account of corporate social responsibility. Brief factsqua the issue are that during the appellate proceedings before the learned Commissioner (Appeals), the assessee company raised additional grounds for the above-mentioned years claiming deduction of expenses incurred by it following guidelines issued by the Government on corporate social responsibility. It was submitted by the assessee company that the expenditures under the Corporate Social Responsibility Scheme were debited in the profit and loss account. However, while making computation of income, the same were added back under erroneous impression of the Act and wrong understanding of the provisions of law, that the same were not allowable expenditures. The matter was not raised before the learned assessing officer and realising the mistake, the issue was raised for the first time before learned Commissioner (Appeals). It was prayed before the learned Commissioner (Appeals) that the grounds should be accepted and the issue should be considered on merits.\nHowever, the Commissioner (Appeals) did not accept the submissions of the assessee company. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) considered the issue in para (C) of page 6 of the consolidated Order, dated 8-10-2013. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) held that the claim made during appellate proceedings for the first time cannot be entertained in view of Apex Court decision in case of Goetze (India) Ltd. v. CIT (2006) 284 ITR 323 (SC) : 2006 TaxPub(DT) 1528 (SC). Hence, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) rejected the claim of deduction of expenses on account of Corporate Social Responsibility activities and additional grounds raised by the assessee company were dismissed.\nAggrieved by the order of the learned Commissioner (Appeals), the assessee is in appeal before us.\nWe note that learned Commissioner (Appeals) is not justified in not considering the additional grounds raised before him for the first time. It is well settled that the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has ample power to consider an issue though not raised before the learned assessing officer during assessment proceedings. It is a settled law that an appeal being a continuation of assessment proceedings, it would be permissible for an assessee to agitate its grievances before the first assessee authority. In case ofCWT v. Smt. Vimlaben Vadilal Mehta (1984) 145 ITR 11 (SC) : 1984 TaxPub(DT) 0879 (SC) it is held that when an appeal is filed against an assessment order before the AAC, the assessment case is thrown open and appellate proceedings constitute a continuation of the assessment proceedings. In case of CIT v. Kanpur Coal Syndicate (1964) 53 ITR 225(SC) : 1964 TaxPub(DT) 0339 (SC) it is held that scope of AAC's power is co-terminus with that of the ITO. Commissioner (Appeals) has plenary power in disposing of an appeal. He can do what the ITO can do and also direct him what he has failed to do. In case of Jute Corporation of India Ltd. v. CIT (1991) 187 ITR 688 (SC) : 1991 TaxPub(DT) 0505 (SC) it is held that the observation of the Supreme Court in case of Kanpur Coal Syndicate (supra) are squarely applicable in the interpretation of section 251(1)(a). It is held that power of the AAC is co-terminus with that of the ITO. If that is so, there appears to be no reason as to why the appellate authority cannot modify the assessment order on an additional ground even if not raised before the ITO. An appellate authority while hearing an appeal against the order of a sub-ordinate authority has all the powers which the original authority may have in deciding the question before it. The Hon'ble Supreme Court"}
{"text":" in case of CIT v. Nirbheram Daluram (1997) 224 ITR 610 (SC) : 1997 TaxPub(DT) 1136 (SC) has held that the High Court was in error in holding that the appellate power conferred on the AAC under section 251 was confined to the matter which had been considered by the ITO. The Apex Court held that the power of the AAC is plenary and co-terminus with the power of the ITO. The Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in case of Ranicherra Tea Co Ltd. (1994) 207 ITR 979 (Cal) : 1994 TaxPub(DT) 0317 (Cal-HC) has held that power of Commissioner (Appeals) is not confined only to the materials on records at the time of assessment. Commissioner (Appeals) has plenary powers and can make such further enquiries as he thinks fit and has all the power of original authority. The power of Commissioner (Appeals) is discussed in case of Hukumchand Mills Ltd. v. CIT (1967) 63 ITR 232 (SC) : 1967 TaxPub(DT) 0194 (SC). It is observed that power of AAC is not confined to the subject matter of the appeal, but extends to the subject matter of assessment. The entire assessment is thrown open before the AAC. The AAC may deal with all points and grounds which arise from not merely the subject matter of appeal, but even from larger area of subject matter of assessment. In case of Cellulose Products India Ltd. (1985) 151 ITR 499 (Guj) (FB) : 1985 TaxPub(DT) 0441 (Guj-HC) while interpreting the power of Tribunal, the full Bench of Hon'ble Gujarat High court has held that the powers of the AAC are wider than the power of the Tribunal. The principle laid down in earlier decisions was also approved in the Full Bench decision that the jurisdiction and power to deal with the matter in issue must be from the perspective as what was subject matter of assessment and not merely what was the subject matter of appeal. Reference may also be made to another decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in case of CIT v. Ahmedabad Crucible Company (1994) 206 ITR 574 (Guj) : 1994 TaxPub(DT) 0375 (Guj-HC). In case of Smt. Prabhavati S Shah v. CIT (1998) 231 ITR 1 (Bom) : 1998 TaxPub(DT) 1202 (Bom-HC) it is held that on a plain reading of Rule 46A, it is clear that this rule is intended to put fetters on the right of the assessee to produce before AAC, any evidence, whether oral or documentary, other than the evidence produced by him during the proceedings before the ITO, except in the circumstances set out therein. It does not deal with the powers of the AAC to make further enquiry or to direct the ITO to make further enquiry and report the result of the same to him. This position has been made clear by sub-rule (4) which specifically provides that the restrictions placed on the production of additional evidence by the assessee would not affect the power of the AAC to call for the production of any document or the examination of any witness to enable him to dispose of the appeal.\nConsidering the legal position explained above, we admit the additional grounds raised by the assessee and the same is being adjudicated in the subsequent para of our order.\nWe have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record, we note assessee incurred these expenses by following specific guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for public sector enterprises. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) is not justified in bringing a new issue of application of income for CSR expenditure in terms ofCircular No. 1\/2015, dated 21-1-2015 which has been issued in relation to Explanation 2 to section 37(1) of the Act which is prospective and applicable from assessment year 2015-16 relating to expenses incurred with reference to section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.\nThe CSR expenditure is always an expense to be reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss Account. Such treatment is considered in generally accepted principles of accounting. Regarding preparation of budget of CSR expenditure based on Net Profit as per Guidelines of CSR issued by the Government, it is submitted that a measuring rod has to be decided to finalise the quantum of CSR expenses and net profit is the best measuring rod. In the Guidelines, loss making Enterprises are exempted from incurring CSR expenses on the logic that the Enterprise must survive on its own before contributing for the welfare to the State. The CSR expenses are mandated to all profit making Central Public Sector enterprise. Hence, Gross Receipt or Turnover of an enterprise is not considered to determine the quantum of CSR expenses. Thus, simply because Net Profit is taken as base for"}
{"text":" determining the budget of CSR expenses, it need not lead to the conclusion that the expenses are application of funds and not allowable expenses. In accounting treatment of CSR expenditure, these are revenue in nature and the same should be charged as expenses to the Statement of Profit and Loss Account. However, when an 'asset' is created from such expenditure, the definition of the word 'asset' as per 'Framework for Preparation and Presentation of Final Statement' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAI) should be followed and when the control of the asset is transferred to others, the same should be charged to Profit and Loss Account.\nWe note that regardingCircular No. 1\/2015, dated 21-1-2015 where it is stated that CSR expenditure is an application of income and not an expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of carrying of business, it is submitted that Circular No. 1\/2015, dated 21-1-2015 has been issued explaining the provisions of Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014 and the same should be read with the provisions of Explanation 2 to section 37(1) of the Act inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014 with effect from 1-4-2015. The Explanation states that expenditure incurred by an assessee on activities relating to corporate social responsibility referred to section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall not be deemed to be an expenditure incurred by the assessee for the purpose of business or profession. As a deeming fiction has been created in the Explanation and hence its scope is limited to the purpose for which it is created. The deeming fiction has been created for CSR expenses referred to in section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the same cannot be extended to expenses incurred following mandated Guidelines on CSR for Central Public Sector Enterprises. Moreover, the deeming fiction of the Explanation has been effective from 1-4-2015 and the same is applicable from the assessment year 2015-16 onwards and the same cannot be applied retrospectively for earlier years. The creation of a deeming fiction establishes that the same has been introduced to negate another available view and hence the scope of Explanation 2 to section 37(1) of the Act is limited to the fiction created and the same cannot be extended to earlier years. For that we rely on the judgment of the Coordinate Bench of Raipur in case of ACIT v. Jindal Power Limited in [ITA No. 99\/BLPR\/2012] : 2016 TaxPub(DT) 3082 (Rai-Trib), for the assessment year 2008-09, where it has been held that expenditure on Corporate Social Responsibility though voluntary, is allowable as business expenditure. It is also held that Explanation 2 to section 37(1) inserted with effect from 1-4-2015 is not retrospective. It applies only to Corporate Social Responsibility expenditure referred to in section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and not to voluntary Corporate Social Responsibility expenditure. The Tribunal has observed that the amendment in the scheme of section 37(1) which has been introduced with effect from 1-4-2015 cannot be construed as to disadvantage to the assessee in the period prior to the amendment. This disabling provisions, as set out in Explanation 2 to section 37(1), refer only to such corporate social responsibility expenses as under section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and, as such, it cannot have any application for the period not covered by this statutory provisions which itself come to existence in 2013. Explanation 2 to section 37(1), is therefore, inherently incapable of retrospective operation and prospective in nature. From the facts of the case and issue of law discussed hereinabove, it is clear that the assessee company is entitled to claim of deduction of its Corporate Social Responsibility expenses under section 37(1) of the Act. Therefore, we allow assessee's Ground No. (6) for the assessment year 2007-08, Ground No. (6) for the assessment year 2008-09, Ground No. (7) for the assessment year 2009-10 and Ground No. (5) for the assessment year 2010-11, Ground No. (2) for the assessment year 2011-12, Ground No. (3) for the assessment year 2012-13,Ground No. (3) for the assessment year 2013-14, relating to claim of deduction of Corporate Social Responsibility expenses.\nGround No. (2) for the Assessment Year 2007-08 Rs. 16,17,31,186\nCapital work in progress Rs. 20,00,000\nCapital work in progress Rs. 4,22,70,535\nThe assessee informs us by way of written submission that he does not want to press this ground, therefore, we dismiss the common ground No. 7 raised by the assessee as not pressed.\n\"(8) Disallowance of claim of deduction for Interest paid under section 234D of the Income Tax Act, 1961. \" Interest on excess refund\"\n"}
{"text":"Common ground No. 10 raised by the assessee reads as follows :\u2013\nWe have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record, we note that the assessee company claimed that there was an apparent mistake in computation of income for the assessment year 2009-10 as prior period depreciations amounting to Rs. 2,58,27,259 and Rs. 22,83,310 were not adjusted in computation of income. It was claimed that the two amounts should have been added to current depreciation. During assessment proceedings, the assessee company realised the mistake and informed the learned assessing officer in its written submission in para 3(c) of the submission dated 12-8-2011 which is given in page 4 of the Paper Book for the assessment year 2009-10.\nOn appeal, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has held that the proper course of action for the assessee was to revise the return of income under section 139(5) of the Act. The assessee having failed to revise the return under section 139(5) within prescribed time, the same cannot be allowed in view of the decision of Apex Court in Goetz (India) Ltd. v. CIT (2006) 284 ITR 323 (SC) : 2006 TaxPub(DT) 1528 (SC).

We note that learned Commissioner (Appeals) is not justified in not considering the matter on merit. The mistake was informed to the learned assessing officer and the learned officer accepted the contention of the assessee. Only at the time of passing of the order, the learned officer forgot to consider the matter. As the matter was raised during assessment proceeding as evidence of submission of the assessee before the learned officer was on record (Page 4 para 3(c) of the Paper book for the assessment year 2009-10) and the learned officer failed to consider the same in the assessment order, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) should have considered the matter on merits. It is well settled the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has a plenary power to consider the issue in merits.\nWe note that in case of Ahmedabad Electricity Co. Ltd. (1993) 199 ITR 351 (Bom) (FB) : 1993 TaxPub(DT) 0430 (Bom-HC) it is held that the basic purpose of an appeal procedure in an income tax matter is to ascertain the correct tax liability of the assessee in accordance with law. Therefore, the appellate authority can consider the proceedings before it and the material on record before it for the purpose of determining the correct tax liability of the assessee. There is nothing in section 254 or section 251 which would indicate that the appellate authorities are confined to consider only the objections raised before it or allowed to be raised before it either by the assessee or by the Department, as the case may be. They can consider the entire proceedings to determine the tax liability of an assessee. In case of CWT v. Smt. Vimlaben Vadilal Mehta (1984) 145 ITR 11 (SC) : 1984 TaxPub(DT) 0879 (SC) it is held that when an appeal is filed against an assessment order before the AAC, the assessment case is thrown open and appellate proceedings constitute a continuation of the assessment proceedings. Considering the facts and circumstances narrated above, we direct the assessing officer to allow the prior period depreciation.\n\"(11).

The assessee had furnished details of bills amounting to Rs. 33,30,854 only and for the balance amount of Rs. 5,61,254 (Rs. 38,92,108- Rs. 33,30,854), the assessee had not submitted any bill and it was purely a provision. The assessing officer had disallowed the amount of Rs. 5,61,254 and added to the total income of the assessee for the assessment year 2010-11. It appears from the books of the accounts of the assessee that the amount of Rs. 5,61,254 were reversed and credited to P&L Account in the relevant assessment year 2011-12. Considering this factual position, we do not find any infirmity in the order of learned Commissioner (Appeals), his order on this issue is hereby upheld and grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue is dismissed.\nGround No. 5 raised by Revenue inITA No. 97\/Gau\/16, assessment year 2011-12 relates to in directing the assessing officer to verify the facts relating to the issue of Rs. 2,09,46,273 under the head 'Provision for Stores' as giving direction for verifying the facts and allowing it is not within the purview of section 251(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\"If the amount of Rs. 2,09,46,273 was disallowed and taxed in earlier assessment years, the same amount should not be taxed again in the assessment year 2011-12, if entries are passed in the books of account by crediting the amount in the profit and loss account. Otherwise, the amounts will be taxed in two assessment years. I direct the assessing officer to verify the facts and allow deduction of the amount if the same is taxed twice.\"\nWe note that on perusal of the assessment order 2010-11, it is observed that the assessee had debited Rs. 13,56,00,000 on account of Provisions for Stores in Profit & Loss. The assessing officer in the assessment for assessment year 2010-11, had disallowed the said amount as the amount claimed by the assessee was only provisions and not any ascertained liabilities. However, it appears from the schedule 'O'- 'Miscellaneous Income of Profit & Loss Account for assessment year 2011-12 of the assessee, the amount of Rs. 2,09,46,273 being the provisions of stores was reversed by crediting the amount to profit and loss account.

However, appeal before higher authorities need not make an ascertained liability into a contingent liability in all cases. The assessee company clearly explained why and how the provisions are made following different paragraphs of the Accounting Standard AS-29. Moreover, subsequent developments of the events of dismissal of the appeals by the Golaghati Court fortify the justification of the assessee to make provisions of the interest liability in the previous year relevant to assessment year 2012-13. Hence, the assessee is entitled to deduction of Rs. 1,88,88,019 being the provisions made for interest liability for the previous year relevant to assessment year 2013-13. I am of the view that the provisions of section 194A are not applicable to the facts of the case. Section 194A of the Act is applicable at the time of credit of the income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof whichever is earlier. In case of the assessee company, an unilateral action is taken by the assessee company to recognize its liability and a sum of money is kept separately as provisions in its books of account for the liability. The liability is recognized and provided for in the books of account, but the claim of the party is not accepted and communicated to the party is not credited to the account of the party or the amount is not credited to any account whether called interest payable account or suspense account or by any other name in the books of account. Only a liability has been created in the books of account and no income by way of interest is credited to any account. Hence, I am of the view that provisions of explanation to section 194A are not applicable. Since there is a view that interest from part of judgment debt, following the well settled trite of law that if two views are possible, the favourable view to the assessee should be taken, the assessee company deserves benefit of doubt for non-deduction of tax at source under section 194A of the Act. As I hold that provision of section 194A is not attracted to the facts of the case and the assessee, provisions of section 40(a)(ia) is not attracted.\"\nAfter going through the order of learned Commissioner (Appeals) on this issue, as noted above, we do not find any infirmity in the order of learned Commissioner (Appeals), his order on this issue is hereby upheld and grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue are dismissed for assessment year 2012-13 and 2013-14.\nGround Nos. 1 and 2 in Revenue's appeal inITA No. 29\/Gau\/2018, for assessment year 2014-15 and Ground No. 1 in Revenue's appeal in ITA No. 278\/Gau\/2018, for assessment year 2015-16 relate to deletion of addition of Rs. 261,88,998 and Rs. 1,54,25,500 respectively relate to disallowance under section 14A of the Act.\nWe have heard both the parties and perused the material available on record. We note that learned Commissioner (Appeals) viewed that, the assessing officer failed to consider the accounts of the appellant company which shows that the company earned huge profits and utilized only a very small portion of it for investment in mutual funds which generated exempted income. No nexus between the borrowed funds & mutual funds was established by the assessing officer, hence, learned Commissioner (Appeals) deleted the addition. Aggrieved by the order of learned Commissioner (Appeals), the Revenue is in appeal before us.\n53.After giving our thoughtful consideration to the submission of the parties and perusing the judicial decisions relied upon by the learned AR, we find that the issue involved in the present appeal is no longer res integra. We note that Special Bench of ITAT in the case of Cheminvest Ltd. v. CIT (2009) 121 ITD 318 (Delhi) (SB) : 2009 TaxPub(DT) 1964 (Del-Trib) held that the dis-allowance under section 14A of the Act can be made even in the year where there is no exempt income earned or received by the assessee. The decision of the Special Bench on which the Commissioner (Appeals) placed reliance has since"}

CIT (2015) 378 ITR 0033 (Del) : 2015 TaxPub(DT) 3520 (Del-HC), wherein it was held that if there is no exempt income earned or received by the assessee, no dis-allowance is warranted under section 14A read with rule 8D of the Rules. We note that Coordinate Bench of ITAT Kolkata in the case of REI Agro Ltd. v. DCIT (2013) 144 ITD 141 (Kol-Trib) : 2013 TaxPub(DT) 2256 (Kol-Trib) has held that it is only the investments which yields dividend during the previous year that has to be considered while adopting the average value of investments for the purpose of rule 8D(2)(ii) & (iii) of the Rules. The aforesaid view of the Tribunal has since been affirmed as correct by the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in G.A. No. 3581 of 2013 in the appeal against the order of the Tribunal in the case of REI Agro Ltd. (supra).\nWe note that there is no disallowance under rule 8D(2)(i). Besides under rule 8D(2)(ii) no disallowance can be made as the assessee has own funds which is more than investments made by assessee. However, for disallowance under rule 8D(2)(iii) only the dividend bearing securities should be considered; for that we rely on the judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of Kolkata in the case of REI Agro Ltd. (supra). Therefore, we direct the assessing officer to compute the disallowance under rule 8D(2)(iii) read with section 14A of the Act, taking into account dividend bearing securities. Therefore, we allow these grounds raised by Revenue for statistical purposes.\nGround No. 2 raised by the Revenue inITA No. 29\/Kol\/18, for assessment year 2014-15 relates to deletion of addition of Rs. 11,49,095.\nWe note that Commissioner (Appeals) during assessment year 2012-13 & assessment year 2013-14 allowed provision for interest, part of which was reversed in assessment year 2014-15. Assessing officer had gone for appeal to ITAT for assessment year 2012-13 & assessment year 2013-14. Reversal of the said provision in assessment year 2014-15 was disallowed in assessment by assessing officer, which was not contested by NRL, as provision was already allowed in earlier assessment year by Commissioner (Appeals).

David joined Baker and Sons in 1956 with which he was involved, in one way or another, for the next 60 years or so.\nAfter Joining Baker and Sons, David soon rose through the ranks from Cost Clerk, quickly establishing himself as indispensable to the Managing Director. In 1965 David became a Director and later Managing Director in 1968.\nIn 1971, with the help of John Knott and Bernard Speakman, David took the company over; they were to remain lifelong friends. The company became Bakers of Danbury Ltd for which David remained Managing Director until the early 1990's. Under their control the company's reputation soared and it went from strength to strength, with work on churches and ancient buildings becoming a particular speciality.\nDavid was personally involved in major refurbishment works at Waltham Abbey, St Albans Cathedral and Writtle Church as well as projects on countless other parish churches. He stopped working full-time in 1994, but continued working part-time until 2005. David also served on the Fabric Committee for Chelmsford Cathedral from 1991 to 2015.\nIn 2013 David wrote within the book \"A History of Bakers of Danbury Ltd\";\nI am proud to have been part of the team responsible for carrying the firm forward for such a long period.

The tower has been thoughtfully designed to capture the rain water on a felt roof within the tower and redirect it back out from under where the tower meets the church.\nThe duck house sits on metal stilts with the wooden legs sitting above the water level to prevent the wood from sitting in the water and rotting. It took a whole day to paint the duck house which includes details such as a mallard duck, flowers and detailed stone quoins, very much like those on St Johns.

Bakers have always been on Eves Corner, so we bought the Christmas tree to go on Eves Corner last year, as a thank you to the village too.\"\n\u00a31 million refurbishment\n8th February 2019 Latest NewsBakers of Danbury, builders, church, Church Architecture Awards, Church Architecture Awards 2018, church repairs, church restoration, Church works, conservation, EASA, Ecclesiastical Architects and Surveyors Association, National Churches Trust, st mary's, St Peter and St Paul's Church, Stoke, stotfold st marys, The King of Prussia Gold Medal, upper stokeKate Gunner\nBakers of Danbury recently completed a \u00a31 million refurbishment project to improve and extend nine alms houses, some of which date back to the 18th century.\nThe 18 month project saw nine properties within the Old Square, Colchester, Essex undergo the following improvement works:\nDemolition of 3 single storey extensions\nConstruction of 3 two storey extensions\nReconstruction of 2 existing flat roofs with external patio\/balcony\nComplete new kitchen installation\nComplete new wet room installation\nLandscaping to enhance the area - communal gardens and planting areas\nSubstantial internal alterations to improve circulation and space\nDemolition of old sheds and garden walls\nRemoval of raised walkway and stairs\nNew energy efficiency measures installed\nefficient and controllable heating\nenhanced fire precautions\nScooter charging facilities\nFormer Colchester Mayor, Alderman and farmer, Arthur Winsley, who died in 1726, left much of his property to a new charity to house 12 men who had: \"lived well and fallen into decay\".

As a result, a major restoration of the aisle was necessary, with associated masonry works to the tower and re-roofing of the nave and chancel.\nBakers of Danbury carried out underpinning of the South Aisle to St Peter and St Paul's Church, during which 20m long foundation piles were carefully positioned, so not to disturb any archaeology below ground.\nA new tiled roof was installed to the aisle following timber repairs, along with structural repairs carried out to the south aisle. The nave, chancel and aisle roofs were retiled with a specially selected blend of new handmade tiles to replace the old.\nBakers also carried out consolidation and pointing of the tower, and fitted new Kent rag stone (supplied by Baker's sister company Collins and Curtis Masonry Ltd) which replaced damaged stone on the windows, parapet and turret.
